0,"Excelent movie, interesting, moving.  Must see!",1
1,It's a very sweet character study movie. You should watch it when you're not looking for something heavy. All the actors are quite excellent. Someone compared it to The Devil Wears Prada and of course it's a similar situation but this isn't a comedy and doesn't try to be. It's actually more like The Devil Wears Prada - the book. I quite enjoyed it and agree more with the critics than the public in this review. That it got less appreciation by the public is surprising.,1
2,Surprisingly entertaining. A very well told story. I enjoyed it.,1
3,"It's a blank page upon which nothing is written but a lot of name-dropping and insipid moments by some drippy characters that don't mean anything. 

Dismal and unwatchable.",0
4,"Dla spokojnych ludzi, trzymających emocje w sobie, z prostymi marzeniami. Dobrze się ogląda",0
5,"I really appreciated all the insider gossip about the New York City based publishing industry and all the eccentric characters and business practices behind some of my favourite books and authors. The romance and personal development was sadly a bit less interesting, but overall I loved it.",1
6,"Think ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in the book publishing industry, and you've got a pretty good idea what this fact-based personal memoir is all about. When aspiring author Joanna Rakoff takes a job as an administrative assistant at a prestigious, old school New York literary agency, hoping it would help her advance her writing career, she's disillusioned at being relegated to the role of a glorified secretary. But her creative juices are stoked when she's assigned to handle responses to the ample fan mail sent to one of the agency's high-profile clients, the notoriously reclusive J.D. Salinger, with whom she develops a stimulating long-distance creative relationship. The heartfelt story is witty, charming and insightful and will especially appeal to those seeking to launch writing careers of their own. Director Philippe Falardeau's latest tells an engaging tale, even if it tends to be somewhat episodic at times in its attempt at covering an array of story threads. Nevertheless, it all hangs together reasonably well, thanks in large part to the fine performances of Margaret Qualley, Colm Feore and, especially, Sigourney Weaver as the agency's often-prickly boss, as well as several whimsical fantasy sequences that keep the narrative delightfully refreshing. Given the subject matter, ""My Salinger Year"" won't suit everyone, but those with a literary bent will find it an intelligent, uplifting watch that rises far above much of the cinematic trash being released these days.",1
7,"Undoubtedly the greatest success of this film, minor but charming, is its aesthetics, the beautiful composition of the colors and the careful execution of the frames.",1
8,2 out of 5 stars. Boring drama about a young writer joining a literary company where she reads all fans mail towards J. D. Salinger. While questioning about why they dispose of the messages. Boring plot. Dull direction. Tedious performances with lacking chemistry with the characters.,0
9,"It's not surprising JD Salinger never appears in ""My Salinger Year."" Or that JD Salinger is all but tangential to the story. Why? Protagonist Joanna is insufferably self-centered. And self-important. Not as clever or charming [by half] as the author who wrote her supposes she is (it's autobiographical). Joanna admits she never bothered to read Salinger, altho' her narcissism (undoubtedly recognized by everyone but her--including the audience) leads her to spout off on Salinger regularly, at times penning letters to his fans, doling out life advice, presuming to know what Salinger would say.  

Joanna (again: author of the autobiographical ""My Salinger Year"") is one of those tedious people equal parts clueless and bombastic--self-assured and dithering--which she, far more than anyone else, construes to be the makings of an adorable person. The character Joanna, like most people who tend to be that enthusiastically fond of themselves, leaves little room for anyone else to like her very much. Her endless muck-up, gaffes, invented competencies, errors, and bad judgement in her professional life are characterized as endearing, but even the other characters or actors in the film don't seem convinced. Just too tiresome and obnoxious.

Tho I suspect the actress who plays Joanna brought greater likability to the character than the actual person. 

The film additionally has stupidities, for example, Joanna proclaims ""At Berkeley I was the only East Coaster--it seems my brand of New York irony didn't go over well with in Southern California."" But...Berkeley is in Northern California. Joanna makes herself out to be the only sane, smart, savvy, rational person in all of New York--none of the other characters are fully drawn. Her boyfriend is supposedly a Socialist, yet he never talks about Socialism or politics and comes off like Kelso in That '70s Show. His last name is Murphy but he's always using Yiddish words, which--again, I'd imagine this is the fault of the author--somehow isn't meant to be ironic. They're supposed to live in Manhattan but somehow they live in a one-story dump like a trailer?

It gets 2 stars because the portrayal of the publishing world in New York, during that era, while quite shallow, at least isn't glorified or sensationalized, and is portrayed pretty honestly.",0
10,"Excelente filme que nos ensina sobre diversidade. O filme nos deixa a mensagem que nunca foi opção de ninguém ditar o que é certo ou errado sobre os costumes, gostos e orientações de outras pessoas, mas sim, apoiá-las e aceitá-las da forma que elas se sintam mais felizes.",1
11,"This was a wholesome, heartfelt & emotional movie. Not only does it show raising transfluid child but, how someone with a criminal background can change himself and others for the better.",1
12,"I really liked this movie, in spite of Justin Timberlake playing a criminal.  I loved the story of this little boy, how Timberlake protects him, and how the story ends.  Tear-jerker but worth watching.  I will watch this movie again.",1
13,"I was pleasantly surprised by this somewhat slow moving, but always thoughtful movie that sees and cheers for the hope in humanity. I'm not a fan of Timberlake's singing, but he's always been pretty solid as an actor and he thoroughly brings it to his broken character trying to redeem himself. I liked his backstory and how it developed and his relationship with the boy and how he changed Palmer's own preconceptions. I liked the way they addressed gender identification in such a positive way without having it take over the narrative. One thing that was nice is that we get enough information to figure things out on our own without being spoon fed the story rather than relying on flashbacks or an ""audience is too stupid to figure it out on their own"" explanation of things. The kid, Ryder Allen, is really great as this confident-within-his-skin young boy and Juno Temple is spectacular, as always.  The only thing I hate about movies like this is they make me cry and I hate making a mess of my makeup (JK), but I do hate crying in movies.",1
14,Beautiful film and such an accurate description of small town southern living but with a protagonist you want to root for.,1
15,It's a very good movie a must watch if you haven't yet.,1
16,What a delightful surprise. My husband and I started this movie because we couldn't find anything else. We said we'd give it 15 minutes and give up if it wasn't good. We were both riveted credits to credits. We laughed and cried. Beautiful acting by all. A lovely and believable story. Nothing too overdone. Just a good old fashioned wonderful movie.,1
17,Phenomenal movie!!!!!,1
18,"Not at all impressed. The acting was stiff at best. Had the potential to be a good movie, but focused on all the wrong things.",0
19,Timberlake's performance carries this lackluster story.,0
20,"I really liked this movie. The protagonist, Agnieszka Mandat-Grabka, was wonderful. She really made the audience feel her anguish, anger and then acceptance similar to the stages of grief. Her love and respect for animals in contrast to the attitude of the ruthless hunters and others was so nicely woven into this story.",1
21,A pretty good murder mystery based in an isolated Polish village close to the Czech border.  [,1
22,"Undeniably different with its own typical style and tone, the movie proves to be as visually striking as it can be too much of a slow burn. Navigating between a strange gory thriller and the portrait of an edge of the world community, the film is more a social drama than anything else but does it in its own matter and yet proves to be the work of an author, so kuddos for that...but still can feel hard to sit through.",0
23,"""Spoor"" kept me engaged from start to finish.

Pro tip: watch the movie in its original language with subtitles.  The cast - especially Agnieszka Mandat - are phenomenal when heard with their own voices.",1
24,A strange film with some odd characters that keeps you waiting for a resolution which it never quite delivers.,0
25,"I love a good murder mystery film, I only wish that Spoor was a good murder mystery film. It is a clumsily-constructed narrative that basically requires all the police to be morons, as they voluntarily ignore what should be obvious. It focuses on an eccentric old woman who is an avid nature lover that obsesses over the well-being of all animals. Living where she does in Poland, she is surrounded by a society of people who greatly value hunting, and that puts her at odds with almost everyone. She also forms some loose friendships with the outsiders in town, but this is primarily the story of her journey, and how she keeps discovering the bodies of dead hunters. I will say no more about the string of murders because there is a chance you might be surprised at what is happening, but it seemed fairly obvious to me. Now it’s not impossible to enjoy a mystery when I figure it out early, if the journey is still worthwhile. Spoor has a laborious pace that is off-putting. I was struggling with the tedious pace, and how long we would go without progressing the plot. It was almost like the murders weren’t being treated as something to worry about at all. There was never a sense of urgency, and the scenes with police never felt like they were investigating much more than a purse snatching. The sub-plots about the hooker with a heart of gold, and the nerdy programmer were given as much weight by the film-makers. It is such an odd film that did little for me. There’s also one moment at the end that I found laughably stupid, and I could not comprehend why they thought it made sense. There are elements of Spoor that are worth watching. It helped that I had constant hope I would be wrong about whodunnit, but I certainly can’t see myself recommending it to anyone else.",0
26,Worst movie i've seen in years. ,0
27,"Spoor is the movie you desperately thirst for if you are a marginalised environmental stalwart, sickened by the continuous barrage of hatred directed toward animals and fauna in your local neighbourhood.  The film work is mystical and fantastical, but it it will heal your worldly ailments.   It may be a beautiful fantasy, but it will inspire and soothe you.  Watch this film, and it will carry you for months.  This movie will not disappoint.  ",1
28,"Vague and overly odd at times, but overall memorable for its stunning visuals and mood.",0
29,this movie pushed all my buttons - haven´t ssen something like that in a long time. Quite genius,1
30,A beautifully-made social issue film about a topic deserving more public attention. And that final scene!,1
31,"The story clearly is about an important topic/issue, and the two acting leads--Justin Chon (who also wrote the script and directed the film) and Alicia Vikander--are excellent in their roles. The final scene is gut-wrenching, but it is a scene which probably occurred in many airports as immigrants got deported. I give it four stars as opposed to five because there were a few elements of the plot/storyline which seemed a bit implausible, illogical. Did I ""like"" the movie? I don't know. But it certainly deals with and focuses a spotlight on an important issue which many Americans probably are not aware of, and I give the movie MUCH credit for that.",1
32,Well done in every way!  Left the theatre with tears in my eyes!  Both lead actors were spot on as well as the child!  All around surprise great movie. Talked about the storyline for days after!,1
33,"Powerful, poignant, extremely well done. A heartbreaking tale straight from today.",1
34,"Oscar contender for sure, real sad the broken immigration system for people who are adopted but still facing deportation after decades of living in the US.",1
35,This was an emotionally impacting story that opened my eyes to the terribly flawed immigration laws and procedures within this country with regards to deportation. the movie was very well written and delivered. It starts little slow but I highly recommend it.,1
36,"I really enjoyed this movie from the way it was shot, to the performances and the story. It wasn't perfect but it was definitely great.",1
37,"Very emotional movie that shed light on a situation I've never thought about in my life. I enjoyed the cast performance, the soundtrack, and the cinematography. My friend said they hadn't bawled this much in a movie, ever. I was also very emotional by the time the credits rolled.",1
38,"Excellent movie.  It has plenty of good scenes from a cinematographer point of view.  He deals with a very important issue: adoption laws that lead to deportation. As we learned in the movie they can be faulty and imprecise.   Unfortunately, Justin Chon falls into some cliche scenes resembling Hollywood.   Good movie.  4.5/50",1
39,Good emotional movie. My gf cried.,1
40,I fell asleep in the theater.  Just couldn't hold my attention.,0
41,I'll admit I didn't go in to this movie expecting much but was completely thrown off in a good way!! I watched this movie at least 3 more times. Emma Stone does an amazing job!,1
42,love the energy and character concept. Only thing that missed was a change on character without reason or explanation,1
43,"One of the best Disney Stories ever.  This movie makes Cruella a complex character that Emma Stone does a great job in portraying Estella/Cruella's schizophrenia. The Horace and Jasper characters and their roles are brilliant and by the end we are all hating Emma Thompson's character, (a tribute to her brilliant acting)",1
44,the how and why of the chariture becomes who she is and her acompleants that works with her,1
45,Absolutely AMAZING. Incredible leading actresses for the storyline. Disney does it again. Definitely worth going to see.,1
46,"Loved the music, the story line! Emma Stone was bad to the bones!",1
47,"The story lines & characters.

I hated the volume.. too loud.",1
48,Amazing and much better than i ever thought it could be. Will lowkey have you rooting for Cruella by the end of it all. Cheer the villian.,1
49,Very entertaining and loved the music!,1
50,I am a sucker for these kinds of real-world court films. The acting is strong too.,1
51,"Outstanding.  Very interesting. Similar to the battle over hemp and subsequent outlaw of it.  Claimed it was invasive and denied use of this valuable product for many years.  Now it's abundantly available. So now it's not invasive???
Someone should create an economic assessment of the monetary loss that these corporate goliaths have cost the American people in their corporate greed quest.",1
52,"Important film. I remember this case well, and I am glad they made this movie, so that younger generations will know this story of a man who stood his ground against this giant corporation. It was a joy to watch Christoper Walken in the main role.",1
53,Great little gem of a movie on one family's fight against Big Agriculture. Great performance by Christopher Walken.,1
54,"It's good to see the usually difficult to like Christopher Walken taking a role that shows he can be more human. Here he drops most of his intensely bullish traits to bring life to a man of the earth and does so quite well. With a string of movies about corporate greed or corruption this one can't bring all that much new to the genre (after all, it is a genre) I have not seen the documentary about this case but it felt like this production was at least attempting to bring a documentary style to this telling. 

While there are serious doubts surrounding the ethics of so-called not for profit activists groups, who too often tend to be more in line with political manipulation than the good of mankind, Christina Ricci injects her group member's character with a reasonable amount of believability.  

The rest of the cast work hard to create a pleasing outcome and while it's a slow-moving story it's filled with hope, that at times, right can defeat might - even if not all the outcomes are as desired.   Production values are high with locations being well used - this is good of its type even though some of the truth might be fiddled somewhat.",1
55,"Anti-science bullshit

At best, frustrating for genuine farmers trying to go about their business without harassment from flat earth / anti vax / backwards / misguided sceptics

 At worst, a misguided, fear spreading, environmentally dangerous message, and shameless anti science misinformation designed to create fear

If you're a believer in science, and not spreading fear through misinformation, don't get sucked in by this shit",0
56,"I am not a farmer, I don't know a lot about genetically modified foods or seeds so this film was both an education and a stark warning.

Seed saving and cultivating is farming, taking seeds from your best crops and using them to sow the next years crop.

Mixing strong genetic lines and mixing individual plants in order to make a stronger plant with a greater yield. 

This film not only opened my eyes to plight of farmers all over the world but also the dangers of GMO and what a Pandora's box it is.

This film needs to be watched by everyone. This film should be shown in schools.

I can't say enough, with inspiring performances from Christopher Walken and Christina Ricci.",1
57,"This movie drama was pretty good. Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, Zach Braff, and the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in this movie. This true story about a farmer fighting against a huge corporation in court was dramatic, inspirational, and heartfelt. It's about staying strong and fighting for what is right not just for you but for the whole world. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.",0
58,A decent film. Another terrific performance by the great Chris Walken.,1
59,This is a very good movie~,1
60,Nonsensical ludicrous plot.,0
61,Quirky and fun and very original. Engaging from start to finish.,1
62,Very easy to watch. Quirky with all the characters relationships with Pixie played out.,1
63,"Clichés abound. Ireland = priests and scenery. Check. Small time gangsters = dumb. Check. 
Some of the Irish accents are pretty terrible too, Alec Baldwin being the main culprit. 
The shoot out scene was ridiculous too. 
Wouldn't recommend at all.",0
64,"Pixie is an engaging funny Irish tale with a splash of blood. Cooke shines, with plenty of charisma shining through. There's definitely lots of inspiration from elsewhere, but this picture is a good time.",1
65,"Extremely boring. I like Olivia Cooke and liked her in Ready Player One but this movie did not seem to heighten her strengths as an actress. I just don't find her believable as a hard core bad ass murderer, she just doesn't have that look. Her fake Irish accent had nothing to do with it either.",0
66,Movie Rating:   5/10,0
67,"Fun, unexpected and different. Beautiful performances, entertaining story, quite hilarious as well. A great watch!",1
68,"Pixie is an engaging, although slight, dark heist thriller film. Set mostly in the wilds of Ireland it's the tale of Pixie Hardy and her plans that go drastically wrong. Pixie sets out to avenge her mother's death. But a heist, that will allow her to escape her small town life, goes horribly wrong. She is then forced to team up with two misfits and they go on the run with drugs scored from the heist and a team of priests in deadly pursuit. The film is darkly funny at times although a little predictable. The scenery is great though and Olivia Cooke is very charismatic in the lead role. An entertaining film but one best suited to a rainy afternoon.",1
69,"It was better than expected.  It has the feel of a small independent film, depending on dialog and story telling rather than huge set pieces or expensive effects.  If you like independent films, you'll probably like this.  It's well acted and has a compelling story.",1
70,"Heartwarming and inspiring.  This movie reminds us of someone who still believes and commits to hard work, patience, and virtuous behavior.  Sometimes it seems hard to find in our current society among all the chaos we have these days. This reminds me somewhat of The Rookie (2002) with Randy Quaid.",1
71,Great inspired family movie!,1
72,Its an uplifting story based on facts.,1
73,true to life story. Actual clips from Warner's game throws enjoyable.,1

75,Such an inspiring story!,1
76,I loved the movie. Kurt Warner was do down to earth and I was excited to be exposed to his story.,1
77,Truly an American dream story.  My late  husband told me that Curt Warner had a very unusual path to NFL star and he he admired him very much. That was what made me want to see the movie. It proves if you have the talent and persistent determination anything is possible in these United States.  Heart warming. Bring tissue,1
78,The characters in the movie were believable and inspirational.,1
79,Loved the way the movie showed in detail all of the events that lead up to Kurt Warner being one of the best ever undrafted players in the NFL.  Would have like to seen a few more actual highlights of his career.,1
80,"L'eleganza e la prosa di questo dramma sono senza dubbio di spessore e di qualità, seppure difficili da apprezzare a fondo per i non amanti del genere, considerando la lentezza delle azioni e dei dialoghi, e la piattezza delle figure maschili.
Troppo risalto viene dato ad un invadente narratore che racconta le numerose lettere ed appunti di diario, prendendo il sopravvento sui dialoghi e sulle azioni.
I due personaggi maschili poi sono clamorosamente sacrificati, piatti e poco più che oggetti utili come contesto, che però appesantiscono e rallentano ulteriormente ogni sequenza in cui sono presenti.
Buono il finale.",0
81,"This is quite a subtle film in a sense, even though it depicts some intimate scenes. It's fairly atmospheric at points and I liked the light poetic type narration provided. It's somewhat immersive and its a bit sobering at times. I thought the two main characters gave decent performances. It reminded me a little of Cold Mountain, certainly at the start. The dialogue is pretty softly spoken and most scenes are pretty darkly set, which is either atmospheric or somewhat off putting I suppose. Personally, I'd recommend this film, yes.",1

Every day passed boringly until the day you appeared.  Then it seems to be happiness, joy.  What we bring to each other is excruciating pain, choking nostalgia.",1
86,"[Spoilers ahead] The dialogue throughout most of the movie felt flat, but I did enjoy the relationship between Abigail and Tallie. Unfortunately it follows the long held LGBT movie standard that two women cannot live happily ever after together. Perhaps I've been spoiled too much by the endings hetero romances usually get, but when I watch a movie touted as a romance, I expect to be smiling at the end as the couple finally overcomes whatever obstacles were in their way and rides off into the sunset together. But this is yet another LGBT film that has left me feeling disappointed and depressed, and I sincerely regret wasting an hour and half of my life watching it.",0
87,"The World to Come is a beautifully acted, very tender and moving period drama about finding love in a hostile environment. Set in 1856 in upstate New York the film tells the tale of two couples in an isolated farming community. Abigail and Dyer have recently lost their child and are feeling distraught and lonely. There is little love in their marriage. Finney and Tallie move in close by. Tallie confides in Abigail and they bond over their loneliness and lack of love. After months of hardship through harsh winters Tallie and Abigail begin a love affair. This is a quiet film but emotions burn deeply beneath. It's a great portrayal of the strength of women in times that didn't give them much respite. All four lead actors are stellar as expected. Katherine Waterston, Vanessa Kirby, Christopher Abbott and Casey Affleck are always a pleasure to watch. This small wonderful film is certainly worth your time.",1

91,"GITMO BLUES
A criminal saga tackling post nine-eleven Guantanamo Bay, starring Jodi Foster means golden awards time. But wait, there's more.

Based on Mohamedou Ould Salahi's best selling ""Guantanamo Diary"", ""The Mauritanian"" comes with a predetermined spoiler concerning the prisoner in question, that thankfully, doesn't take away from the drama. Salahi survived to write the tale, but hoo-boy, what a tale. Rounding up suspects for quick and dirty revenge, the Bush, well, Rumsfeld government established a lawless concentration camp in Cuba of all places, where suspects, usual and unusual, would conveniently disappear. Inexplicably, it exists to this day. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people resulted in a one way ticket to Gitmo. That was Salahi's fate.

""The Mauritanian"" presents the story in just the right amount of hazy smoke and curvy mirrors, to create a thickly grey area of suspicion and guilt that hints at the sketchy character's association with terrorist organizations.

As a dignified, secretive, even jovial Salahi, Tahar Rahim carries the film, divulging bits of a muddy past as crucial pieces to an expansive puzzle. A complex figure at the centre of a fuzzy web of intrigue. His righteous, by the book lawyer Nancy Hollander, played straight up proper by Jodi Foster, a studious and persistent stickler for the law, methodically unravels layers of the story without succumbing to favouritism. Dark lipstick, white hair and a steely resolve, she's all business. The military prosecutor with a sympathetic southern drawl, an admirable Benedict Cumberbatch unfortunately proves a distraction to those familiar with his mother accent.

Never mind, Foster is swell, and Rahim absolutely kills it. This plays out like real life, so insufferably frustrating, red tape plodding at times, and without the usual bombastic court room explosions Hollywood favours. Even the climax suffers a bit of a post resolution stumble, which actually dots the i and crosses the t in the excruciating story. International chess ain't cut and dry, and neither is this film.

- hipCRANK",1
92,"A well done, fact-based, military legal drama centered on the 9/11 attacks that suggest corruption and cover-up at the highest of governmental levels.  Slow build, as expected from a thorough legal drama, but the end delivers enough to elevate it.",1
93,A fantastic film in every way,1
94,"A rare emotional film that captures a true story; not based on a true story but the actual events that occurred in history, in a subtle yet magnificent manner. Yet another stellar performance by Tahar Rahim who captures Mohamadou's optimistic constitution.",1
95,"Based on a true story, this is a gripping, eye-opening account of events that are based on a best-selling book, centered around the experiences of a former prisoner at Guantanamo. He was never actually convicted of a crime. I liked the lead performances, especially of Jodie Foster and Benedict Cumberbatch.",1
96,"Very late in seeing this movie, but a while back I heard Mohamedou interviewed on a podcast and he recommended the movie. He said it was the easiest way to understand his story. Based on the interview I heard, the movie seemed to stay reasonably close to the gist of what happened. I thought this movie presented the events well, and the performance by the lead was outstanding. I'm still reeling from seeing his experience at Guantanamo portrayed on film, and the filmmaker didn't even show the evil acts in their fullness.",1
97,"I had modest expectations going into ""The Mauritanian,"" a screen adaptation of the book ""Guantanamo Diary,"" which blew the whistle on the U. S. treatment of prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. Usually, if a movie as Oscar-baity as this one fails to receive a single nomination, it's because it's not very good. So call me pleasantly surprised when I discovered the film to be the exact opposite.

To some, ""The Mauritanian"" will likely be too heavy handed. It's one of those liberal Hollywood diatribes (and I say this as a self-identified liberal progressive) that can be too much even for those who've already bought what the movie is selling. I might have been turned off if I'd been in a different mood when I watched it. But sometimes, the commitment of the people making the movie can overcome its excess earnestness, and that was the case for me here. Among the usual Liberal Activists = Good, U. S. Government and Military = Bad tropes, the film does try for some nuance in its characters. Jodie Foster gives a sensational performance as the attorney dedicated to freeing the film's protagonist, played in an equally wonderful performance by Tahar Rahim, and we're allowed to see that she's unlikable and conflicted. Likewise, Benedict Cumberbatch, as the prosecuting attorney, is introduced as what we're sure is going to be a macho Southern military goon stereotype, complete with unacceptable accent, but the movie subverts our expectations and shows that he's capable of letting personal and patriotic feelings be outweighed by humanitarian ones. Granted, the film does none of this elegantly or delicately, but I just appreciated a story that at least attempted to populate a liberal/conservative issue movie with characters that are more than easy ciphers. The film could probably be criticized as yet another white savior story, and those criticisms would be justified. But it's a damn good one.

Shailene Woodley rounds out the cast as Foster's assistant, and she's excellent as well. The director is Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland""), who has a knack for making blisteringly entertaining movies out of gruesome true event subject matter.",1

112,"It's Rosemary's Baby-esque in a few ways, but Son really is quite its own thing. That said, what it is is a slightly below average horror outing and a stomach ache. The acting is subpar as is the story. I suppose the thing you could say it does ""well"" is its body horror as it is often legitimately sickening. I don't know...this one just wasn't quite my type despite it being solid for what it is.",0
113,"At last.  I seem to be in agreement with professional reviewers !  

I think one of the main ingredients in a successful horror movie (or maybe any other genre for that matter) is that you can't wait to see what happens next and that keeps you glued to the screen.  This movie provided that kind of suspense.   And I was mostly satisified with what did in fact come next.  Had I been more than satisfied with the outcome; had I been amazed by it; then I would have given the movie 5 stars.  The ending was a surprise but just not the surprise that I would've liked the most.

Maybe I would've taken it in a slightly different direction if I had written iit and maybe I would've developed certain aspects of the story more; but all in all this was a solid good film, inventive and clever.",1
114,"Otro logro de Shudder, buena película de terror en general. Buenas escenas, buen ambiente. Te mete en la trama y te involucras con los personajes. Por momentos resulta algo lenta y cuando se aproxima el final medio que te la ves venir pero igual no arruina la cinta para nada.",0

121,This guy should've done better as a cult leader.,0
122,"I knew nothing about WeWork and don't really follow financial news, but still found the documentary interesting. It was well edited with the use of many interviews and numerous pieces of archival news reports. Can be a little boring if you don't care about the financial markets and stories from that industry.",0
123,"Informative, yet empty, Jed Rothstein's documentary film on WeWork and it's owner and founder Adam Neumann is ultimately limited by its scope.  Often abrupt for no reason, Rothstein can't get his arms around the truth is stranger than fiction tale.  After going on the journey it ends so fast it leaves you wanting more, but also wondering why more questions were not answered.  If you like middle of the road docs about greed.... There are a ton better.  Final Score: 5/10",0
124,"This documentary is not perfect, but it does a good job in showing how WeWork co-founder Adam Neuman lied and grossly exaggerated what exactly WeWork is and what it 's business model is.  Neuman seemed more interested in throwing ludicrously overblown corporate events than actually doing work.  He said publicly that he did not like offices that isolated workers from one another, yet he has a large corporate office that is isolated from other workers.  He just thought he would convince people too give him money and that would keep WeWork going.  Otherwise, the documentary felt a bit flat.  Mainly because it seems very familiar.  A documentary about a company or person who said they would change the world but they were a complete phony.  We have seen that in other (and much better) documentaries such as the Academy Award nominated ""Enron:  The Smartest Guys in the Room"" and ""The Inventor"".  In the end, this documentary is not terrible, but it could have been better.",0
125,"A very entraining look into the rise and fall (and maybe risk again?) of WeWork. At times it was engaging, ridiculous, exciting and educational.

I wouldn't want to watch this film in a theatre, but watching it with my roommate at home and pausing every 5 minutes to discuss or look things up was a great Friday evening.",1
126,"Well with a name like Adam Neumann, of course you're going to have a messianic cult complex.",0
127,"I remember seeing a 60 Minutes segment on this concept years ago and remember thinking it sounded like they were trying to promote a socially acceptable cult. They apparently were and, as is the case with most cults, it functioned as a vehicle to enrich and prop up the leader at the expense of the members.",0
128,What a crazy story! I was so invested.,1
129,A very warm and life-affirming movie. In many ways it is rather unambitious but it achieves what it sets out to do and the leads are both charming and play well off each other. Far from the best entry movie dealing with time loops but one of the good ones for sure.,1
130,"Cute, but a bit slow-moving. Kathryn Newton is quite mesmerizing. It was in the benefit of my wife - a light movie for her entertainment - but she slept though most of it.",0

The most important plot point in the movie — how the stowaway got on board — is completely ignored and looms over the entire movie as a huge, gaping plot hole. The acting is good but that's about it.",0

143,"Great movie with excellent performances. No monsters/aliens/wormholes, just smart people trying to figure out an excruciating moral dilemma.",1
144,"**slight spoiler alert**
This film was a lot better than I expected, a moral conundrum set on a space journey to Mars. One thing that kept nagging at me was why didn't they just turn around when they discovered they had a stowaway on board and not enough oxygen for him. Did a quick google to see if I could find any info on this gaping hole in the plot but turns out I had missed it that they'd mentioned that they were too far from Earth and the amount of fuel required to turn around would be too great. But then when the stowaway wakes up the first thing he sees is Earth looming large out the window into space so Earth looks close?! Also how were they going to then get back from Mars or was this a one way journey? I feel the writers really should have explained this more - anyway I think I worry about plausibility too much in films and should just myself enjoy them as they are. Good sci fi flick, def recommend though.",1
145,"Glaring plot holes in the premise and crisis point of the film made it very hard to immerse yourself and get into, especially because the film was trying to ground itself in psychological and scientific realism (scientifically, it was fairly well grounded, at least regarding the space station physics, not so much the golf-ball sized blobs of solar particle radiation). It was such a promising film, but it really needed better writing direction to reach its full potential, so it's a shame to have to give it such a low review. The acting was commendable, even with the flat script. Although many reviews commend the one-sided dialogue with mission-control as a way of making the crew feel more isolated, to me, it seems like a lazy way of hand-waving away all the more logical approaches to solving the problem by not actually hearing them for ourselves, only being told by the cast that ""there were lots of ideas, and they were all worse than the one we're going to try"". Never have I watched a film where the plot holes jumped out so blatantly the second they appeared",0

I can kind of understand.   The creator mind.  When he wrote this movie.   So, if anybody, thinks this is not real.   And really is not going on.   Not only in Seattle.  Where this movie takes place.  But, around the entire world.

You better take heed.  Don't think this is a joke.  Don't play with God/Christ with that Satan.  Or the spiritual world.   Your Souls.   Or your physical.  Or mental health.  Where especially this secretly goes on.  Or the Law of the Land.  Thinking you can get away.   With God/Christ.  Or man with Satan's forces.   It may have come from out of Hollywood.   And some may not believe it.   Until it really starts to happened to them.  And even then.  It does not hit home with them for years.  What is really going on.  With Satan warring with God/Christ to take over the earth.  And rule it for eternity.  He needs to be put in Hell.   And not released in another 1,000 years.  He need to be locked up for eternity.",1

Shadow In The Cloud's score made me put off watching this really cool movie for a few years. WTF would they give it a low rating for? It wasn't supposed to be super serious so it being over the top shouldn't be an issue.

170,Sexy unforgettable film,1
171,Absolutely loved this film! Radically challenged the way I think about relationships and brought fond memories of a trip I took to S. France once!,1
172,"Ma Belle, My Beauty is a beautiful film portraying a nuanced and layered love story. The film centers the relationship between Bertie and Lane, two women who have loved and hurt each other, as they navigate their past and present. Unlike many films these days, this movie isn't trying to make a point or spell out a foregone conclusion, it's an authentic and real depiction of navigating identity, communication, and connection. Coupled with strong characters, a witty and thoughtful script, and  an incredible soundtrack, you can't go wrong with this film.

Set in a beautiful location in the South of France, the film is a sensory delight that transports you to a strong sense of place through the attention and care it gives to sights, smells, sounds - a deep and genuine love note to this particular region of France.",1
173,"Lovely insight of old passions never really disappeared that clashes with present choices and life directions. The movie is very tender, the delicacy of the dialogs communicate a sweet uncertainty in the protagonists feelings, an honesty very much appreciated, that makes a love story genuine and not banal. I believe it's a must watch, maybe a cult someday!",1
174,"I am so glad I decided to stream Ma Belle, My Beauty!! I had seen some of the great reviews popping up here and there. Bored at home one afternoon, I saw the Apple trailer and decided to settle in for cozy watch from my couch. My husband watched it with me and loved it. We paused the movie many times so we could discuss the storyline - we were so wrapped up in it! I lived in France and studied French literature for many years. This felt like a beautiful journey back to all the wonderful and challenging aspects of living abroad. There were so many beautiful layers of culture and understanding laid out in this film. National identity, gender identity, sexual identity, professional identity... nuances of love, responsibility, loyalty, creativity, citizenship... it all overlaps in a thoughtful way. I absolutely found myself caught up in the journey of these characters - loving them, hating them, and then loving them again. I am not surprised at all that it received fan favorite at Sundance. Absolutely recommend!",1
175,"Touching film. This is a personal film from the director and you can feel it. It's vulnerable, messy...it's love.",1
176,Absolutely stunning! Such care and honesty is taken with the writing and the location and music are to die for.,1
177,"If you missed your summer vacation in southern Europe this year, no worries, Ma Belle, My Beauty will transport you there for a fraction of the cost. Beautifully filmed in the south of France amidst vineyards; charming market towns; old stone farmhouses and breathtaking scenery, you will want to jump into the set and follow along with the characters as they navigate the twists and turns of a broken polyamorous relationship. The jazzy soundtrack adds another level of enjoyment to the experience. Keep a bottle of wine and the corkscrew handy. Well worth the price of admission.  Ma Belle, you are clear for takeoff!",1
178,Thoughtful story beautifully filmed.,1
179,"The suffocating and anxious feeling throughout the film alongside the shaky camera work made it very easy to the world through Joseph's eyes. Ben Winshaw's performance was outstanding, very physical and realistic. 
I think this film offers a lot to think about as Joseph's character raises some questions about his childhood, his strained relationship with his parents and what led him to his breakdown. 
Overall a cool film definitely worth watching",1
180,I loved it. Ben Whishaw is amazing. I feel like I need to come down after watching it. Great film. Didn't look at my phone once.,1
181,"Gripping, each scene keeps you wondering when the protagonist will get caught. The message is questionable but Ben Whishaws performance cannot be faulted.",1
182,Brilliant performance. Riveting portrayal of the disturbed mind. Must see.,1

184,"I absolutely loved this movie
Fabulous acting. I really felt his anxiety and frustration.",1
185,Awful plot without progression nor explanation of the different mood change whilst he still retaining normal thought process and never gets caught.... Also the fact he was able to get up right after being hit in an auto accidental.... Beggars version of Split ?,0
186,"Want to watch a movie about a guy losing his mind? Well, here you go.
""Descent into madness"" movies are nothing new, from ""The Shining"" to ""Taxi Driver"" and scores of others that did it far better than ""Surge."" 
Played with manic abandon by Ben Whishaw, Joseph is a neurotic, discontented guy in London who works as a security checker at the airport, has a parlous relationship with his parents, and bites into a water glass just because he's frustrated with his prosaic life. 
One day, Joseph goes nuts at work and walks off his job. He goes to an attractive co-worker's flat to help her hook her laptop computer to her TV, but when he runs to a nearby store to get a cable, his debit card doesn't work. He tries an ATM, but it eats his card. So he robs a bank (without a gun). Then, he fixes his friend's TV, has sex with her, and robs another bank. Later, he checks into a luxury hotel, completely trashes the room (including ripping open the mattress and climbing inside), and he crashes a wedding party.
Is he rebelling against the constraints of society, or is he just insane? I suppose that's the big, existential question the movie poses, but I honestly didn't care. 
The jerky, hand-held camera work is intended to portray Joseph's disjointed mental state, but it's nothing but artifice. In several scenes, the cameraman literally shakes the camera back and forth. Thirty minutes into this movie, I was dying for a mounted camera, or at least a Steadicam.
This is the kind of movie that pretentious, artsy Sundance types consider ""revolutionary"" and ""daring."" (Whishaw won a Sundance Special Jury award for his acting).
Four stars for Whishaw's committed performance. He really does knock himself out. One star for the annoying cinematography.",0
187,"If you want to understand mania, watch this film.",1
188,It was good but also lost in it's overt pace. Nausea accompanies the jumpy camera work and that makes for a point drop to me. I get it. You want us to feel his angst. But I want to watch a movie not feel ill whilst doing so.,0
189,"This movie was fun not just because of the pranks, but because of the crazy premise. Great job by the lead actors and the crew. Also, stay till the end to see how the people react after the scenes are done (it's good!).",1
190,"I never thought I'd see Eric's balls, and yet here we are. Lmao. That guy at the beginning was a real homie for trying to help Eric out. Pretty damn clever the way they set up the pranks in order to get candid reactions from people. They must have hidden and positioned those cameras really well. Omg, they got married and then the priest started making out with both of them lmao. That scene in the grocery store was crazy. All the special effects and editing was pretty impressive. 

This movie's hilarious. It's so random at times but it's got a good storyline. There's moments throughout the movie that are so outlandish and ridiculous that it ends up being comedy gold. The way they set up some of the gags is so clean. There's some really crazy concepts and ideas in this movie. Like the gorilla scene and the Chinese finger trap scene. Tiffany Haddish was great. Especially that last part where she's a white man and the guys are white chicks lol. This movie was a riot man. Total craziness, this movie's a good time. Definitely entertaining and worth a watch.",1
191,"I was in a lousy mood so I put on this movie. So fun, really turned my day around. I'm not a fan of gross-out humor though, so it loses half a star for that.",1
192,"Incredibly entertaining film. It's like Jack*ss but with a loose plot. Also, loved seeing Michaela Conlin from Bones featured in this film.",1
193,"In Bad Trip, Chris and Bud (Eric Andre and Lil Rel) embark on a riotous road trip from Florida to New York (with hidden cameras in tow) in order for Chris to express his feelings to the girl he's loved since grade school.  Despite the plot being threadbare and the hidden camera trick feeling a bit dated, it's actually a refreshing take on the concept, primarily because the unsuspecting victims, for the most part, come across as decent people just trying to do the right thing.  Andre and Lil Rel are wildly likable throughout, Tiffany Haddish is unrecognizable as Bud's sister Trina, an escaped convict on the trail of her brother, who she believes stole her car, and there are enough laughs (the gorilla attack, the bar scene, among others) to smooth out the rough parts.",1
194,Not much of a story. Classic Eric André.,0
195,refreshingly funny! didn't feel forced at all :),1
196,"Eric Andre is a funny dude and here he has funny moments from time to time. The story is pretty generic of course as intended, so you're all here for the pranks and some are pretty damn good and some others were pretty forgettable. I'd like to two leads but for some reason the  actress Tiffany I just found to be so annoying. Overall, Worth a watch because of those few funny moments.",0
197,"Following in the footsteps of ""Bad Grandpa"" before it, ""Bad Trip"" blurs the line between hidden camera comedy and the traditional road trip romp. With Eric Andre's absurdist comedic stylings added on top, however, you're ultimately given an even more madcap and wheeze-inducing experience. I've said it before and I'll say it again -- there is something to be said about Eric Andre's commitment to a bit. All those years of filming pranks for ""The Eric Andre Show"" has put nothing but ice in his veins. His ability not to break during a bit and to improv on-the-fly is always something I'll get a kick out of watching. Lil Rel Howery and Tiffany Haddish (whose scripted comedy roles can sometimes be hit-or-miss for me) are welcomed additions to the fun as well. A real surprise, this one.",1
198,"One of the funniest movies you'll ever see. Without ruining anything - this isn't another predictable prank movie. This movie has brains, huge laughs, and most importantly a big heart.",1
199,"It was a sweet, sad movie. I was hoping for more ""mystical"" and less sadness. It reminded me of a Hallmark movie...not worth spending 50.00 on (yes..including popcorn)",0

Non c'è il fascino della grande impresa criminale o l'orrore del crimine più efferato, solo la storia di uno squallidissimo ed orribile giro di truffe dove dovremmo rimanere colpiti dalla forza della protagonista?
Uno spreco di casting, soldi e tempo.",0

219,A very deep and depth spy movie. Its attractive and not easy to get through it. Still mixed up about the sides of spys.,1
220,"Cliff Walkers is a profoundly awful film. Ironically, it gets deserved high marks for being visually stunning. It has great art direction, clean editing, and the casting is good. But everything tragically stops there. The plot is impossibly convoluted and so utterly ridiculously and needlessly intricate that it leaves zero room for even basic character development. Every character is essentially moving through beautiful shots, mindlessly double-crossing everyone else. And then there is dumb stuff... like all the spies are given poison pills, but only AFTER they have started the dangerous mission. First they parachute into snow-covered wilderness, and THEN they are standing in knee-high snow distributing tiny white pills. Meanwhile, the spies are supposedly under constant direct surveillance by enemy agents, and yet repeatedly they escape various gun battles and knife fights. Lots of bullets fly and blood is drawn, but hardly anything of consequence happens. You could cut 20 minutes from the middle of the story and miss nothing. It's a spy cartoon masquerading as a serious film. And since everyone wears the same stylish black, and nobody is telling the truth, it's impossible to say who is working for whom. Some people will blame the impenetrable anti-plot on CCP (Chinese government) story censors. But don't kid yourself. There are MANY good films made in China in spite of CCP censors. This movie is NOT one of them. It's a sad tragic waste, a melodramatic empty vessel, a hollow gesture to the sacred honor of the subject it purports to idealize (the fight against WWII fascism). The blame for this film's utter failure rests squarely on the director and writer... and especially the producers who should have insisted on a script re-write. Don't waste your time on this movie.",0
221,It was hard to get invested in the characters and it was unnecessarily confusing.,0
222,"Movie from the masterful auteur Zhang Yimou...
An intricate plot double-cross spy thriller. It is a sumptuous production with amazing cinematography. This period thriller offers a gripping story with a good combination of action and melodrama from the beginning to the end. The movie sets in beautiful snowing Harbin. The camerawork excellently capturing the falling snowflakes while capturing the pulsating action scenes. Well-acted casts esp main protagonist Hewei Yu. His controlled performance when aching to watch his comrades dying and calm when defending himself in front of his equally amazing cold-blooded arch antagonist Ni Dahong.
Highly recommended.",1
223,"Really beautiful, except some of the music score was a very twee harmonica... but at the end I actually admitted to my husband that I wasn't smart enough to follow most of it. His response: ""Same."" SUPER CONVOLUTED. Which I usually appreciate and can make sense of. Not this time.",1

229,"Written, directed and Starring John Pollono. This was a solid indie film and I did enjoy seeing it on the Big screen. I liked the characters in the film, they felt believable. John Berthal and Shea Whigham were both good, playing childhood friends of Pollono. Ciara Bravo was a bright spot, playing Pollono's daughter. Spenser House was good, as well, playing the rich, douche bag college drug dealer. The movie was dark and gruesome, at times. Which i enjoyed. I wish they would have laid out more of Pollono's characters backstory. If Pollono gets to make another film, I will give it a shot. 3/5 stars.",0
230,Really enjoyed this new version of the off-Broadway play. I loved the stage play and thought the screen version was perfectly adapted.

This movie actually made me jump and I never jump anymore. All the couple has to do is be honest with each other for the nightmare to end. This was a fantastic movie,1
240,The only redeeming quality of this movie was its use of suspense however in the end it fell flat. I seriously question the motives of the writers and producers. If you actually sit through the end of the film- you will understand my suspicions! A total waste of a Saturday night!,0
241,"I didn't care for this. I got the point, sure, but there was never a point at which I felt uneasy or spooked or tensed. I felt like the underlying theme was a good one, but the execution did not serve the theme well. Also, there was one scene where the acting was so lacking. The cop-- his acting was so bad that it made the other actors' performances go down in quality. It could have worked in the hands of a better writer/director.",0
242,"It has a good sense of atmosphere and chills, but overall the movie is rather on the boring side more than anything. It's a shame, as I love exploring horror films from various genres, especially middle eastern and south Asian horrors (which seem to be have been on a good rise lately).

The psychological parts aren't very well executed and come off bland, and any of the scares come across as ""better"" jump scares.

I will, however, give it credit for that ending. Easily the creepiest scene in the whole film, and probably the most unsettling scene too.",0
243,Psychologically haunting and cleverly playing with perception and tension in a well directed horror movie of a long endless strange night of weird events. A little slow to start and a bit of repetitiveness are the main downpoint but the actors are good and helped by the setting and a visually controlled cinematography.,1
244,"The Night is a predictable but mostly effective horror film. The acting is all around decent. I liked the production design of the hotel, and the atmosphere was also pretty well done. The scares aren’t anything original but are directed effectively by Kourosh Ahari. I liked the imagery and how recurring images occur throughout the film. I liked the final shot of the film, but the final act as a whole fell flat for me. It played out very predictably. Still, for the most part this kept me engaged. Overall, I thought this was a fine horror movie. It knows what it is and mostly succeeds in it. This is a low 3/5, but that’s mostly because of the final act. If you are a horror fan I recommend checking this out. Ahari has potential as a director, and I’m interested to see what he does next.",0
245,"If you consider yourself a Horror fan, there is  no excuse to not checking this film out the first chance you get.",1
246,"The one night could be ordinary or a living nightmare for an entire family.
IFC pictures and director Kourosh Ahari present a haunted-house psychological horror pic.
After leaving a party with family an Iranian husband, wife, and their baby decide to stay in a hotel in Los Angeles. It's called Hotel Normandie but nothing is what it seems.
Both of them start to see hallucinations of their demons; this place acts like quicksand. The more you struggle the deeper you get in.
They start seeing things from black cats to a homeless man to a small boy. Is the hotel manager even real?
They'll both have to try to admit their darkest secrets to make it out.
There's all kinds of clever tricks of the mind here it almost has that Stanley Kubrick feel.
I give them credit for plenty of uneasy nightmarish visuals.
The ending is a tad confusing though. 
But the true scares come not just from the frights coming at these two people but the actual horrors they've kept locked away inside.
A decent first time directorial effort with a real sense of dread and effective atmospherics.",1
247,"Atmospheric, Stylish Psychological Horror",1
248,"Stunning cinematography, chilling suspense, and a beautiful glimpse into Iranian culture. Was on the edge of my seat the entire time! 

It is such a shame it did not get any Golden Globe nominations, even if just as a political move. We need more foreign films like this highlighting overlooked communities particularly devoid in Hollywood. 

Much watch!!!!",1
249,I enjoyed this one and thought that it continued the story nicely as it left it open for another sequel in the lives of these teens and the drama that surrounds them as they find their way through life as a couple with challenges to overcome,1
250,I don't think anything needs to be said about this.,0
251,"Good way to end the series. Lots of elements from previous movies picked up, but still worth the watch if you're a fan of this series.",0

253,O filme é muito fofo e bom,1
254,"I don't think we loved the character that much to have 3 movies. It was just to show a happy ending and honestly did we really needed that ending did it really fulfilled a place in our heart? The answer is no.

279,An endearing story that will either leave you in tears from laughing or crying.,1
280,"It feels like another version of The Blind Side, but that’s a good thing. It even has a couple of actors from that movie, and in this film the word “blindsided” is even used in a way that seemed to me like it was on purpose. The cast of this movie is excellent, especially Corinne Foxx, who just seems infinitely likable. Very well-made and enjoyable movie. ",1
281,"A Disney+ release based on a true story of Ray McElrathbey, a college football player for Clemson University that takes care of his younger brother while going to college. For the most part the story flows well. There is a time where Ray must hide his brother on campus. That was a little silly, but the rest of the film is well done. Acting wise, everyone did a fine job, but no real standouts. I think this movie is worth your time.",0
282,"Disney takes a rousing story and turns it into a bland, predictable bore.",0

287,"One movie I have recently watched is Safety on Disney Plus. This Disney original follows the true story of a Clemson football player, Ray ""Ray Ray"" McElrathbey who assumes the responsibility of taking care of his much younger brother, Fahmarr McElrathbey, after their mother is forced into rehab. The movie is quite Disney, and oddly enough reminds me a little bit of the Disney Chanel Original trilogy High School Musical. Heartwarming, emotional, and awesome are words that can only scratch the surface of all that this movie is. The story line is much like a roller coaster at the duo seems to always float in and out of being on top of the game and in trouble with administration. In the end though, it is quite nice to see how everyone was able to come together in their support, especially knowing that the movie is based on a true story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a heartwarming story but also does not mind the cringe.",1
288,I really liked it! definitely recommend watching:),1
289,"Look it's okay. Interesting story, performances aren't too bad, moves along okay. The standout performer is probably the music to be fair.  It's only 84 minutes long so not too much time to invest here. If you have less than an hour and a half to spare, and nothing better to do, give it a crack.",0
290,It's a very mid movie in all honesty. I did like the music however. That was good. Other than that it was super slow and not the greatest.,0
291,"Simpática película de bajo presupuesto en general. La historia esta buena, es atrapante pero a la vez extremadamente lenta por lo que por momentos me llego a aburrir y eso ya es mucho decir para un film que no pasa la hora y media. Lo mas destacable es la música y como va variando en ritmo y letras mientras que la ""transformación"" ocurre.",0
292,"Interesting opening - messing a little with the usual tropes. It's a nice start, gentle and patient after that first 'dream'… the problem, is, it keeps returning to that arty, elegiac-lite tone despite sudden moments of monster goodness. Beautifully shot, but too many moments of dialogue that jar like bad character exposition meets pontification and we kinda know where we're going. Needs more wolf and less heavy music-biz metaphor.",0
293,Sometimes the most interesting and unique art comes from a place of darkness/primality and that isn't always a good thing for everyone involved but this should be an enjoyable watch for fans of the horror genre.,1
294,What a shame…. One of the worst one… they should have asked for an antic expert for the set design! What is a modern house from 1980 doing here? And the furnitures! My god! all imported from China few years ago… it was supposed to be owned since few generations… the fake gothic doors built in the frame made me laugh! A lot of errors everywhere… even absinthe was not done the way it is supposed to! No culture … but this is movies today made for stupids… Don't talk about any Special effects … very poor … don't waste anytime here!,0
295,"I can smell something from you. Something primal.

Not sure how I found out about this movie, but it seemed promising with a high Rotten Tomatoes percent and critics saying that there's a lot of gore. And boy if that wasn't a big lie. 

For an hour and 24 minutes runtime, this sure felt long. However, this slow pace made sense considering what the movie was aiming for. Some parts crept me out a bit, but the whole time I was hoping that this would lead to a crazy, bloody, and gory ending.

Sadly I didn't get that. Clearly this was a low-budget movie. Most of the gores were quickly edited and only the blood on the character's face was shown. Honestly if there's more dedication to the gore and designs, this movie could have been entertaining. 

The acting was quite bad, especially 
from the actor that played the painter girlfriend. I did not buy her reactions at all. Also, one scene was incredibly cringe between her and the main character. 

Overall, I was very disappointed with the boring ending and lack of real gore. 5/10",0
296,"meh; the story is interesting enough, but the build up is SUPER slow & SUPER unsatisfying. honestly, almost nothing happens. the whole song writer/singer aspect wasn't really all that believable either - not sure if it was the casting, the acting, or the dialog or what. i wouldn't recommend this one.",0
297,Bad boring vampire turning movie. The main issue that I have with this movie is the main character. She doesn't have the presence of a world renowned musical artist. She has the presence of a normal person with a normal job. I'm not trying to hate on the main actress but I don't believe her as a pop star. And the horror aspect of this doesn't work either. Its not a tense movie. It just happens and it feels very boring the majority of the time. It's unfortunately another movie that I'll forget about in 2 seconds.,0

300,I absolutely loved it. It was random and in every direction. It was like what would happen if ET possessed a crack head in the worst side of town. It really kept me guessing what was real and what wasn't.,1
301,"Time to get weird.  Meet Barry (Gary Green).  He doesn't have a lot going for him, so he regularly drinks and does various drugs.  He's not exactly somebody you would label a keeper.  One day he gets abducted by aliens and will no longer be in control of his actions.  Now I knew next to nothing about this.  I saw a tweet recommendation, read the plot synopsis, and added it to my watchlist.  It sounded like a wild ride, and those are the movies that I typically seek out when I can.  Fried Barry is just that: a crazy story that doesn't have to adhere to any rulebook.  I don't even know if I would fully classify this as a movie.  It's not something you watch; you experience it because it is that much of a trip.  It has a lot of similarities to the NC-17 music video from The Prodigy in the 90s, ""Smack My Bitch Up,"" in the way that it gets experimental.  There's not even all that much story here.  Once Barry's brain gets hijacked, it's basically just him wondering from encounter to encounter in Cape Town, but it just keeps it moving so quickly that you can't help but go along with it.  I don't think I can speak all that much to Gary Green's acting abilities.  He doesn't have too much dialogue in this to be able to tell, but boy, does he have the face that this story needs.  The way he can distort and change his expressions makes you believe that he got possessed by something unworldly.  I also was a big fan of this soundtrack and the sound mixing.  They are always doing something disorienting with the music, and it is hugely impactful to your viewing.  The dialect can be a bit tricky at times.  This takes place in Cape Town, and I can't say that I have an ear for the accent, but if you give any character more than one line, then your ear should be able to adjust.  Fried Barry is not the movie to recommend to everybody.  No sir.  There is an excess amount of sex, drugs, and violence that a large portion of people won't be able to get behind.  However, if you love a movie that gets outhouse rat bonkers, then I give this a big recommendation, as this is about as inspired as this type of movie ever gets.  I could never nail down where it was headed, I just buckled my seatbelt and enjoyed the rollercoaster ride.",1
302,Fried Barry is a really weird and trippy study into the darker sides of human nature and the society we live in. Some moments are confusing and a little but to disgusting. However some scenes are beautiful and hilarious. It also makes you really question the world we live in. ,1
303,Somehow this film got an 80% RT rating so I decided to watch as I'm a fan of the genre. What a disappointment. Even within the bizarre context the plot didn't go anyway. Everyone wants to have sex with Barry in this film which is kind of funny. The allure is never explained.,0
304,"A unique assault on the senses, which is at a times, both an interesting and harrowing experience. Much like 'Under The Skin', this film uses visual and audio aspects brilliantly in an almost abstract way. But unlike 'Under The Skin' the visual/sound elements are mainly a way to show us what the protagonist is going through, which it it conveys pretty well. Throw in some comedy elements and you have one fairly interesting ride of a film.",1

It's definitely dense, and you'll need some time to digest - maybe even a pause in between story sequences. But, if it's your jam, you're gonna want to watch it multiple times.

My recommendation: if you love movies like Fire & Ice, definitely watch it. If you don't know what that is, but if trippy, dark fantasy intrigues you, watch The Spine of Night and see if it is your thing, because it really does not get crafted any better than this.",1

327,"This film brilliantly portrays something that most of us human beings have to deal with daily, that inner critical voice that limits our life, that second guesses our choices and that send us spiraling down in a self critical hole. The voice that in therapy is called the Super Ego or Inner Judge is born out of a wish to protect us in the circumstances that we were born in, but as we grow up, rather than protecting us it limits us. In this film Violet dares to challenge these beliefs and ideas and starts to hear the more true voice within. 
As a therapist I will recommend all my clients to watch it. The process depicted is one that we all could benefit from exploring...",1

329,"Five stars....so well done. Different, fast moving, insightful, loved it!",1
330,An awesome movie that talks about the choices we make every day and our inner voice telling us we aren't good enough. This movie goes through the fears and decisions we have as people when we think about our own choices and teaches us a lesson about self-love. It shows us how you need to be slightly selfish and greedy sometimes and the beauty of it with balance. The half might seem slow and slightly off-put but the last half picks up to be one of the best endings and a fantastically powerful run with amazing performances from our leads. A worth watching film.,1
331,"Violet is a film exec that is living under the weight of a fear-based mindset. The film is interesting because you see her hopes contrasted with the fear's voice while the action is happening. It's a slow break from the past, but a fresh look at the inner workings of a modern mind.",1
332,Violet is a boring film. It is about Violet who realizes that her entire life is built on fear-based decisions. Olivia Munn and Luke Bracey give horrible performances. The script is badly written. Justin Bateman did a terrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.,0
333,This movie touched me in a way no other movie ever has. It somehow captured the way the voice in my head interacts with me and my world in a way I could never have explained. I was as transformed from it as I was transfixed throughout it. Kudos to Olivia Munn. She must hear the voice too. And to Christine Bateman. She definitely does.,1
334,"Very slow and repetitive, at about 1/3 through we were asking ""where is this going""?  It stayed on that trajectory for the rest of the movie, when the credits rolled I really wanted my time back.",0
335,I think it is a very thoughtful movie that speaks to the voice we all have in a our heads. Telling us we are making a mistake or making us afraid to do things. I loved it.,1
336,"So original and thought-provoking. Well acted. Clearly Justine's passion project - and like in the movie - she was probably discouraged by some people from making it because it's ""arty."" In this case, another word for arty is brilliant.",1
337,"The Columnist speaks loudly to the current social media landscape and it says it in a smart, twisted, fun, Dutch dark comedy. Katja Herbers (Evil) is entertaining to watch as Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist who embraces her darkest impulses, as she sinks deeper and deeper into the toxic world of online bullying.",1
338,"I really liked this film because its so contemporary. Its very much a dark comedy - a dark comedy thriller/horror film perhaps. I imagine a lot of people, especially women, can relate to the main character getting annoyed by the numerous vile, mocking messages she sees online about herself, including threats of sexual violence and death. Its a film that directly references freedom of speech, with tthe womans daughter doing a piece at her secondary school about the importance of freedom of speech, while she quietly keeps an eye on who claims to plot what against her online. Numerous people tell her not to go on (or stay on) twitter, facebook and the like but, needless to say, she doesn't stay away for long. I think the 'pull' people feel towards even just glancing at such social media sites on a fairly regular basis, is something many people can relate to and most of us aren't famous journalists, or otherwise in the public eye. I've had things said about me in the past by others online and I've been annoyed by messages and the like but, again, suffice to say (honestly), I haven't exactly taken the law into my own hands. Of course there's a line to be drawn, both legally and generally, in terms of what may be acceptable or fair to do by way of a response to extreme hate based messages about yourself. Its quite a thought provoking film in that way. It does feature violence, suffice to say, although its not constant and extremely gory but it is a pretty bleak film in general, due to the themes it covers. 

I thought this film did well at highlighting an important issue (freedom of speech and how far it should be protected etc.) so I'd recommend it, yes.",1
339,"Seriously, who hasn't wanted to hunt down some internet trolls.  I'm not saying you should actually do it, but I'm sure the fantasy of at least scaring them has crossed all our minds at least once.  The Columnist/De Kuthoer is one of those movies where you quickly end up cheering for the killer because these people aren't just trolls that poke some fun; no they are saying they know where she lives and they are threatening her and being extra awful.  We quickly see how the addiction to social media does so much harm, but also how Femke seems to now be addicted to killing.  The character development in this is wonderful.  We see so many sides of Femke, the harm this addiction does to her, her boyfriend and her daughter; who is inspired by her mom and trying to speak out against issues regarding freedom of speech.  There's a lot of irony in this with Femke silencing people for their words while also saying she supports free speech.  Femke mostly writes a pretty neutral column, but she does end up getting a lot of hate because she is anti-Zwarte Piet/Black Pete.  She's also under stress of deadlines from her publisher for a book she's writing.  It seems the killing helps her with her writing though, so I guess that's good for her and sucks for the trolls?",1
340,It was different. Watched without subtitels so migh have missed some parts but liked the crazy of it.,1
341,"This is an excellent, Dutch black comedy and well worth watching. However it is somewhat spoilt by an error concerning electricity, and a more obvious, major faux pas regarding a shotgun and its ammunition.",1
342,"Time to purge the online trolls.

Have you ever seen trolls on Twitter harassing other people? Do you feel fed up with all these comments? Well, our columnist felt that and now she wanted to get physical with these trolls.

The scene where she started to do her thing got me by surprise. I read the synopsis but for some reason I did not expect that she would do that. After this, I got excited to see how crazy this movie would go, but I was wrong. For only an hour and 24 minutes, this movie was pretty boring and slow. I believe that the violence and gore would have make the message about online harassment more impactful. They got what they deserve right? There was not enough violence in here to make me enjoy the movie. 

Then, the theme itself was conflicting. On one side it's about freedom of speech through the daughter character, but on the other side it's about limiting this freedom of speech through the main character. I became confused on what this movie actually want to achieve. 

Overall, it was just another shallow work from a leftist director. 4.5/10",0
343,"Great movie. Amazing writing, stunning cast.",1
344,"Yeah, so...I found this on my library's streaming platform and remembered I had seen it advertised at a local film festival and figured why not watch it. The story, about a columnist turned serial killer sounds interesting, but the script was so basic & simple that it could have been written by a fifth grader. It honestly must have been a 15 page script, and this film should really have been just a short film, but instead they prolonged it to be an excruciating hour and 26 minutes. Watch it but don't say you weren't warned about the boredom and lack of anything interesting.",0

Grant, Shobna Gulati and Ralph Ineson. Of course it has some serious themes about tolerance and acceptance but it also has some amusing moments as well. It is fairly cheesy and features some cliches but all in all its a fun film I enjoyed, so I'd recommend it to others.",1
347,"🇬🇧🏳️‍🌈 4 Stars!!!! A biographical coming-of-age musical comedy-drama based on the stage musical of the same name. Inspired by true events, the story is based upon the true-life story of 16-year-old British schoolboy Jamie from Sheffield, as he overcomes prejudice and bullying, to step out of the darkness and into the spotlight to become a drag queen. With an incredible and catchy soundtrack, this enjoyable and celebratory musical with an uplifting message will go down in history as one of the most relevant ones in terms of LGBTQ acceptance. The visuals are colourful, the storyline is heartwarming and the performance of newcomer Max Harwood is just awesome.",1
348,.5 out of 5 stars. Everybody's Talking about Jamie is one of the worst films. And very hard to get into it. The film is a musical about Jamie (Max Harwood) who is trying to be a drag queen. The script makes the character feel narcissistic and annoying. Which makes it difficult to connect to the character emotionally. The musical sequences are forgettable. The acting is boring. And it is one musical that is easily forgotten.,0
349,"I have a soft spot for feel-good musicals and ""Everybody's Talking About Jamie"" is no exception. This movie moves at a good pace because the musical numbers are pretty consistent. The story carries a good message and the music kept my interest while watching it. I did feel sometimes certain characters were frustrating in a way that felt a bit over the top, but I could let it slide since this is a dramatization based on the life of an actual person. Overall, it is a high-energy and heartfelt musical that is sure to please genre fans like me.",1
350,"The film version of the stage musical ""Everybody's talking about Jaime"" is a lightweight affair, as musicals often are. There is not much to its narrative, which sees flamboyant 16-year-old Jamie New (Max Harwood) mocked by those around him until he decides to go to his school prom in drag. Lightweight as it is, the story is still uplifting and the while the songs aren't particularly memorable, they have an engaging feel-good energy. Richard E Grant is a highlight as Jamie's aging drag queen mentor Hugo who once performed as Loco Chanel.",1

353,A pleasant surprise.,1
354,"Watchable but infuriating largely due to the absolute use of every stereotype know to the world.  Jamie is unlikeable, sharped tongued and a bit of a arse even for a teenager.",0
355,"I was lucky to catch the stage performance of this in London and I have to say, this theatrical adaptation manages to take the spirit of the west end and transport it onto the screen. All the right bits were updated, an emotional new song added, great performances and mix of drama and musical.",1

362,"Summer of 85

Beautiful scenery, solid plot even though the alternation between past and present dulls the climax. Young love, romance and tragedy portrayed with sheer sincerity by the wonderful cast. The soundtrack is also noteworthy and helps bolster the emotions of the scenes especially Rod Stewart's _Sailing_.",1

Well told story.

Well done. Worth watching.",1
365,"In Between Gays – Film Review: Summer Of 85 ★★★★

Prolific French filmmaker, François Ozon, has made a career out of finding dark crevices in the most unexpected of places. Here, with Summer Of 85, he tweaks this New Wave era gay romance just enough to upend our expectations. In pure Talented Mr. Ripley meets Call Me By Your Name meets Luca fashion, Ozon spins what could have been that sun-dappled, seaside summer that changed everything into a love that perhaps never was, zeroing in instead on a young man's obsession for something unobtainable. Beautifully shot and acted, Ozon takes the story to more provocative places than you'd initially expect while still maintaining the boppy fizz of a great Cure song. Despite the mish mash of tones, the film has a pulse all of its own. It'll make you swoon, pull the rug out from under you, and then make you wonder how he managed to quietly get a little twisted.",1
366,I enjoyed it! Thought it was cute,1
367,thought it was cute with a good message. my kids and i loved it,1
368,A fresh and different movie!,1

376,"'Concrete Cowboy' dropped onto Netflix in 2020 and is actually a decent Netflix movie based around great character acting rather than fancy CGI. 

SYNOPSIS: 'Sent to live with his estranged father for the summer, a rebellious teen finds kinship in a tight-knit Philadelphia community of Black cowboys.'

Although this film is predictable at times with it's storyline, it looks incredible with some amazing photography. Director, Ricky Straub (making his debut here) clearly has an expert eye in capturing some incredibly lit scenes.

The film also features standout performances from Caleb McLaughlin, in a breakout performance, and Idris Elba who quietly does his thing becoming the back bone to the film.

A gorgeous coming of age movie.

7/10",1
377,"I really enjoyed it especially after learning that it  centers on real life ""concrete cowboys"" Who are still currently riding in North Philly.  Apparently there have been urban based male & female riders there for over a century. The interview at the end with some of the real life riders, that are also in the movie was an added bonus.",1
378,amazing scenes with artistic eye,1
379,"That stable life.  So this is about a teenager named Cole (Caleb McLaughlin).  His mother in Detroit won't stand for him getting into trouble anymore, so she throws his clothes into some garbage bags and drives him to Philadelphia to live with his father (Idris Elba).  He's a cowboy who lives in the city, so this is sure to be a drastic change for Cole.  Now this one was on my radar, but it got pushed onto my backburner in a big way.  While it looked intriguing, the fact of the matter is that nobody was talking about it, so it just sat on my watchlist.  Now that I'm prepping for my 2021 wrap-up, I'm prioritizing catching up on films I missed, and Concrete Cowboy is pretty decent.  Now going off the posters, you may be under the impression that this is Idris Elba's movie.  While he gets to showcase his range once again, this isn't the case.  It's much more Caleb McLaughlin's story.  He's grown up considerably since Stranger Things, almost overnight, so much so that I don't know how they're going to make season 4 without making it take place in college.  He turns in some quality work here.  It's just such a bizarre situation to get thrown into the deep end, and he serves as the audience's avatar.  I like the relationship he forms with the notorious horse that nobody can break, and I enjoyed watching him learn the ropes as the story advances.  Expectedly, he is resistant at first, but he eventually comes around.  That's the thing with this movie: it's formulaic and plays out almost exactly as you would imagine, but it's the variables that are mostly quality and elevate it.  I use the modifier mostly because there is also an additional plot thread of Cole getting involved in very generic street crime.  They don't even spell out what exactly is getting pushed, and it makes up such a large part of this story that I have to knock a few points off.  Concrete Cowboy is a film that never rises above being satisfactory.  I think it works from an educational standpoint more than anything.  It may not directly be based on a true story, but there are people like this out there, and it lets you know how much whitewashing Hollywood did to the perception of cowboys.  They use real, non-actor riders who do this on the daily, and that does give this story an authentic feel to it.  It's not bad, so watch it at your own discretion if it sounds interesting.",0
380,Idris Elba is fantastic as always. The story touches upon some interesting thematic qualities. But it also lags towards the end.,0
381,Interesting. The story was a bit predictable.  Reasonably well done.  Idris Elba always does a good job.,0
382,It's strange to me there are not more people talking about this movie. It was so powerful. I had no idea what it was about and was surprised at how taken in I was right away. Wonderfully written and superb acting performances. I keep suggesting it to friends and no one seems to have heard of it that mention it to. Which is a shame because the history alone is worth learning.,1
383,I loved it. This touches base on the shattering realities of the street life versus the perception of it from a suburban life. A coming of age story that shows a boy get humbled,1
384,Good movie. Highly recommend this based on a true story movie.,1
385,"Great movie hard, to picture that this really happened/exists. Really got us thinking.",1
386,One of my favorite movies of all time.,1

389,A contemporary comedy classic.,1
390,"Very colorful and funny. Randomly bought this without knowing anything about it and I had the best time. It is so fun and unique. It’s a very stupid humor, but if you get it, you should love it. I have laughed and laughed. Feels like a future cult classic. ",1
391,I thought this movie was totally dumb and ridiculous.  Jamie Dornan....don't waste your time and tremendous talent on something as stupid as this.,0
392,Wasn't sure what to expect from this going in but I was pleasantly surprised by this bizarre comedy troupe. Equal part ridiculous and heartfelt it felt a little long in the tooth over the long running time (perhaps it could've been more effective as a short series?). It's clear some of the dialogue was just improvised on the day - some of which is great and others felt disjointed when cut together with the rest. Surprisingly fun!,0
393,Very funny and unique. gonna be a cult favorite,1
394,"If you're in the mood for a very silly comedy, Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar might just pass the bar",0
395,"Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is a clever, fascinating, and playfully hilarious film. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (who both wrote the film) did a wonderful job at being two hysterical middle aged women. Wiig and Mumolo did a good job at writing the film with there comical writing that gave us random rib-tickling surreal moments. Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is a loveable comical film that is very enjoyable.",1

405,So mcu fun! Took the family and they had a blast.,1
406,"""Boring"" and ""slow"" seem to be adjectives used by reviews who maybe have no imagination, who couldn't with with themselves and the movie and get lost in the mystery of it all. I liked being able to fill in the spaces with what I believed was happening in this mythical world. I liked the time to reflect on the poetic images. In this age of reality tv obsessed brains, I think this movie dares us to change our pace and what we expect out of a viewing experience. I look forward to more worlds from this director.",1
407,"I did not like The Wanting Mare. It is terribly slow and is too artsy for it's own good. If you like not knowing what's going on for an hour and a half, definitely watch this movie!",0
408,"There seems to be a sub-genre of thoughtful Sci Fi these days (think ""The Wall,"" ""Bokeh""), that also seem to be retrovirally in love with their own sad, lonely sh*t. Lots of lofty ideas and pretty shots, but like other pro reviewers have said about this film, it's all surface, it's logic doesn't really wash or we're never given enough OF said stories, and in this case the filmmaker never delves into the MEAT of anything at all. Yes, it felt like a very arty, overly-long Outer Limits episode. Whoop de doo.",0
409,Tries to do too much that makes no sense.,0
410,Gothic scenery and great acting. But the story is not compelling enough. The last 30 minutes confront the viewer with excessive darkness where it becomes difficult to understand what is going on in the movie.,0
411,"An excellent horror film. The small budget doesn't cause too much of a hindrance. Caveat provides a tense atmosphere and creepy visuals and is packaged with an eerie, claustrophobic environment. I loved this film.",1
412,Original and creepy. It left me wanting more from the ending but overall this is a really well put together horror film.,1
413,"Heavily reliant on atmosphere, this low budget horror flick does a lot with very little, but ultimately can't escape from being a bit boring. Outside of a few extremely tension filled moments toward the end, Caveat lulled me into a haze that was simultaneously effective and dull.",0
414,"The problem with this type of film is that it either works or it doesn't. It's an ambitious approach to be sure but as with what we see here, it just doesn't work most of the time. And it's also ambitious for someone to try to write and direct both but the truth is that very few people (read: VERY few) are successful at it. Typically when I see an indy film where the writer and director are the same person, I know it's going to be mediocre, unfortunately. And, unfortunately, I'm usually right. With this film, it's almost surreal at some points where it doesn't make sense…there are a lot of creepy elements that simply don't add up to much substance. The atmosphere is definitely there, the story is kind of so-so (there's kind of a Shutter Island vibe with the idea of a character ending up somewhere he has been before under mysterious and nebulous  circumstances and that's not my thing. Others might like it but to me, it just takes a scenario and muddies the water when a plot should be clear and direct. After all, audiences want a story, not just moving images. Kudos for the director foregoing the typical jump scares. You won't find those here…you'll find a slow, steady burn with some suspense, a creepy setting, kind of a story that makes little sense at points (yeah, I don't know you well but row me out to an island and lock me up in this leather vest that is chained up in the basement in a house with a crazy woman). Aside from the plot being soft/blurry, the ending is just plain bad. We live in an era where bad endings have been a plague for movies and series alike. And the one thing writers need to keep in mind is that you could craft the best story in the world that is expertly acted by thespians of the highest order and if the ending is bad, you've lost your audience. That's just how it is. You can blow an entire production with an ending that leaves too many questions or open ends. Yes, Netflix series can get away with it because those never end (unfortunately in a lot of cases) but with a feature length, you've got one shot to tie up everything you wanted the story to say to your audience. You can't just build tension and then pump the brakes. Doesn't work from any angle. In this case, it almost seems as if the production ran out of money the last few weeks of shooting and they just ended it abruptly and without much catharsis or explanation. 
At any rate, there are some things to like…acting, set, production value, cinematography. All good. Writing, direction, ending all hurt this in one way or another for what could have potentially been a really scary horror film.",0
415,"It was definitely creepy, although the plot is pretty dry and a little vague.",1
416,"Genuinely creepy and unpredictable film that doesn't make you stretch your imagination *too* far. It had the feeling of peeking into a world with its own logic without getting all the answers handed to you, which make it pretty engrossing. I'm giving it 4 stars because although there were a few plot points that felt too convenient/contrived for the story, it was really enjoyable to watch and I'd recommend it!

I really liked the sets and practical effects and all the actors were fantastic, especially the lead.",1
417,"It’s creepy… but if you are looking for solid answers to all the questions raised in the film, you will be disappointed. ",1
418,"Much overrated, but considering the novice production and financial constraints, this was a pretty good psychological thriller with a supernatural twist. The ending isn't for everyone though for sure, but worth a watch. Cant wait to see what this director does for his 2nd feature film. Score one for the Irish!",1
419,"havent finished yet, saw it after Fyrisbio volontar. in Swedish. read some interviews, he used to struggle, but he is fine now, he resists the past in a very particular way. The documentary took several years to produce, which is quite rare and precious!

420,"An interesting story, just poorly told.",0

431,"This is a borderline carbon copy of The Piano Teacher, and not nearly as good.",0
432,"The great mystery in the film is Jonas, but the development of his character leaves more questions than even the possibilities of answers. Hoss's character is a hard person to like, but I loved her intensity and the intensity of the whole film.",1
433,"A deep and rich character study of a perfectionistic woman who tortures herself with every minute mistake. Watch it for the uncannily great performance by Nina Hoss, one of the great actors of the century. Contrary to what Rotten Tomatoes says - the film is in German with a smattering of French.",1
434,"A slow burn for sure, but a beautiful madness to behold. The visuals and performances are top notch.",1
435,"This is an original, well-made and disturbing horror film! The viewer's attention is held by the increasing strangeness and mystery of the actress' behavior, as the false appearance of a fulfilling family life crumbles, and the film crescendos into horror, madness and terror.",1
436,"At times this Welsh spoken horror from Lee Haven Jones is beautifully shot, but still gives off the feeling of uneasiness from it's lingering shots, ominous score & sound. The story takes its time with the storytelling before building up to some wince-inducing moments of horror.",1
437,One of my fav films of the year. Slasher horror fans won't like it but it is delicious if  slow but a feast should never be rushed...,1
438,"Wow, so very slow and badly acted. The main girl shows up with a whole bucket of hair gel on her head and proceeds to creep around, spy on everyone, and not say a word. 
It's toooo slow, 45 minutes in I had no idea what the plot was.
Just poorly made but ostentatious and smug at the same time.",0
439,"I didn't finish watching this movie.  It's...kinda? interesting, but just seems kind of random and tedious.  It's nowhere near as intense and spooky as the trailer I saw for it gave the impression it was.  I guess there's an audience for it out there, but I'm not part of it, I guess.",0
440,"Definitely has it's share of ""wait, what?"" moments, which were very welcome. I enjoyed my time with the film, it was fun guessing what's going to happen next. This was also the first Welsh movie I have ever seen.",1
441,"This film is a series of disconnected moments with characters that have completely unexplained or nonexistent motives. The primary antagonist barely speaks which in a better movie wouldn't be a bad thing but in this one it only serves to confuse the audience. If I could give it zero stars I would, do yourself a favour and don't pay to see this movie",0
442,The Feast sets up in a serene background and becomes a twisted horror story on a short notice. It's sudden pickup of phase cleverly conjure the predatory ambush. Excellent character set-up. A fresh innovative approach to it's theme.,1
443,‘The Feast' is Bloody Good Eco-Horror,1
444,Not my cup of coffee for sure. I spent the whole time expecting something to happen and by the time it probably did at the end; I have lost all my interest. Best part of it was the co-workers performance.,0
445,Dull as dishwater with wooden acting. Don't waste your time,0
446,I liked it. It has a twist to the familiar story about staying alive and safe in a new world order.,1
447,"An interesting premise but does not delivers what it promises... the Cree people plot deserved better, it had its moments tho...",1
448,"As a concept, the plot travels a well worn sci-fi path. That said, the execution was exceptional with superb performances by literally every actor. I would love to know more detail behind the authoritative party as this film really portrays them in a one dimensional, fascist cliché. Overall, the cast has a lot of heart and the spirit of the film dances with sci-fi.",1
449,The filming comes across as very amateurish.,0
450,"All in all this is a good little movie, limited budget but they did a lot with it. i love post apocalypse movies and this is a decent one.
That said i honesty felt it was quite a well made piece of woke anti white propaganda. following on from a war the Whites are the victors they are called jingos and are fascistic by design the main characters are all good guys and they are all people of colour. there are two white characters a man who just wants to live the good life and is willing to go and live with the fascists and a woman who is well meaning but grossly misunderstands the level the jingos are capable of any other white good guys are extras who silently support the people of colour.
the jingos who do seem to represent white culture are really just fascist caricatures. Other than that there is a twist which i wont go into which you may think is awesome or somewhat unlikely to be possible.
the critic score as usual these days is most likely entirely based on diversity and wokeness the audience score a bit more accurate as to the actual contents of the movie which as i have said is pretty good.",1
451,"Profound in it's simplicity, this incredible film uses fiction (that is far too close to fact) to tell a story of the land, of power, of freedom, and of liberation. Creative and beautiful, I can only hope more people discover this gem.",1
452,"A mixed bag, 'Night Raiders' has moments, but the plot and characters are undeveloped and there are long stretches with no dialogue.  Set well into the future, but with the looks of present day, the world given to the viewer has nothing to do with the statement the film is making.  Danis Goulet's first feature is riddled with cliches, which I would be willing to forgive, if the third act wasn't from another movie.  The first act hooked me but Goulet will struggle holding your attention.  The movie is way too heavy handed trying to tell you how white people have treated Native people.  Also we're in North America and people CLEARLY have Kiwi accents.  Do better!!  Final Score: 5/10",0
453,a real standout scifi gem!,1

455,"Not a bad little Irish vampire flick. Good cast, solid story which rollicks along at a good pace within its brief 89 minute runtime (so it's not too long!). Well worth watching if you are into horror / vampire movies with a gloomy and quirky setting.",1
456,"Set in rural Ireland about local folklore regarding a rumour about a vampire who is said to reside in his permanent resting place underneath an ominous pile of stones near a construction site.  Inevitably the stone monument is dismantled which awakens the deadly predator leaving it up to a father and son and a few other locals to try and stop it. 
Very well made which had the right mix of horror with just enough comedy to make you laugh but without turning it into a parody.  Fun watch.",0
457,Really enjoyed this dark horror comedy. Loved seeing a new take on vampire mythology. Had several lol moments. Totally recommend.,1

The accents and slang are brutal...so subtitles and willingness to look up some of the more colorful phrases ""what's the craic"".   Its a slightly better than average little fright movie but more for the  location and characters, then special effects or pot.  So if you love Ireland and don't mind a wee bit of gore and goofiness this might be your cup of tea.  3 stars out of 5.",0

466,"Quite enjoyable first film in the trilogy, with considerably impressive production value and gory horror fun. However it suffers due to a contrived plot with characters making inexplicable decisions at times to reach narrative beats, and messages that feel mixed.

467,It tries far too hard to emulate the older slasher films and ends up a cheap knockoff.,0
468,I feel sorry for the time wasted on this peace of cr*p movie,0
469,This movie was bad; it was entertaining to watch if bored but it was bad. The characters were mid. You don't really connect with the characters. The plot was too obvious for me. Some scenes were ridiculous to watch. If you wanted to watch a bad movie just to make fun of how bad it was this will be the movie to do so.,0
470,Popcorn time-waster.,0
471,"Classic slasher with some kick ass music! 8/10 for sure. It's not super ""scary"" But it is suspenseful and has some gnarly kills. After about 1hr you really start to connect with the characters. The opening was great as well! I love horror movies and this is a good one!",1
472,"The movie is good, but... A group of teens in 1994 and nobody listens to grunge???? C'mon. Also 'only happy when it rains' was released in 1995, that's a pretty bad error. Do better",1
473,"Great opening. I loved the beginning scene with maya hawke. I thought it was enough to get me interested in the story. But after we are introduced to the main characters the movie got difficult for me to sit through. Deena and her friends are unlikable and I was hoping they would get killed throughout the story. Josh is the only character I liked. 
The two lesbian characters I felt had zero chemistry and I did not care about their relationship. At one point in the movie there is a love scene involving all 5 characters that I felt was very awkward and hard to watch. 
Despite all its flaws the movie has a little bit of fun and surprises scattered throughout. 
I was shocked when some characters were killed and I was surprised when some survived. 
Not the worst horror film I've seen but it's definitely not for me. It's unlikely that I'd watch again.",0
474,"I loved this movie trilogy, absolutely loved it 👌🏻✨ it had those ""80s horror movie"" vibe, with a mix of slasher and paranormal. Loved the vibes, plus it was quite interesting to watch, a simple but very intriguing plot. My only complaint is that the killings weren't too gory or graphic. Well, there was a lot of blood and killings but they weren't ""Saw"" level of gore, it wasn't too graphic. So I recommend it if you don't like too much gore. It shows the blood and kills, but without being too gruesome or graphic (which I'm a little disappointed about, but that's just my preference). All in all, a good fun watch. Made me wanna read the books. A fun watch for Halloween.",1
475,Kristen Stewart's transformation becoming Princess Diana is remarkably convincing.,1
476,"First of all, I couldn't understand much of the dialogue.  Yes, I have a slight hearing problem, but seriously...there were times I was convinced they were speaking a foreign language.  I don't know how much fact there was in this movie...we know Diana was depressed and had bulimia, but I left the theater a little depressed myself and headed for a good Tex-Mex meal with more than one margarita.  I had a lot of respect for Diana during her years in the palace and felt she was dealt a raw deal by the royal family, but when the end of this movie FINALLY came, I really didn't care any more.  She deserves to be remembered in a more caring manner.",0

478,IT WENT NOWHERE. It painted a completely different picture of Diana. Was it based on fact or just out and out vengeance towards Diana? Save your time and money and by a good book,0
479,I loved Kristen Stewart in this movie. It shows the fragile mental state of Diana during the Christmas holiday with the royal family. The movie is more on the artistic site.,1
480,I enjoyed the movie and the acting was wonderful!,1
481,"Performance, aesthetic, and cinematography are great. I understand the plot is not the driven force of this film and it could be a bit dry. Music score is just right.",1
482,It was Ok but I get why a lot of people hate it. It is slow at parts and it makes Diana look like a spoilt brat. Luckily I never really cared for the royal family.,1
483,"Kristen stewart truly deserves an Oscar for this. I had my doubts when the cast her, but I can gladly admit that she did a great job. She completely disappears, like you actually forget that you are watching Kstew. I was impressed and hope she starts getting better roles.",1
484,I wasnt expecting much. A little bit too slow for my taste but enjoyable either way,1
485,BEST BOND OF ALL TIME!!,1
486,Fresh take on the end of an era. This will go down as one of the best Bond movies.,1
487,"an incredible end to the best cycle of Bond films. The first Connery films are great, but these work together in an arc the way none of the other Bond films do.",1
488,"hands down the best 007 movie since Skyfall, absolute masterpiece.",1
489,Daniel Craig is so great in this film!,1
490,The movie was great up until the end.,1
491,Mostly slow. Hate the woke.  I had to see it. Daniel Craig was the best bond in casino royal but he is tired.,0
492,An amazing finish with extremely well done scenes through n through. the whole movie hits different after seeing all 25 films.,1
493,I love the James Bond movies! I gave it a 4 because I didnt like the ending :( .,1
494,Loved the movie. Great seeing it in Imax. Glad it was brought back since I missed it the first time around. Loved Daniel Craig. The second best James Bond.,1
495,One of the best visual masterpieces of the 21st century.,1
496,Loved this. Look forward to the second part.,1
497,"Adapting an epic like Dune is a monumental task, but Villanueva pulled it off. I love all the main series books so I know what kind of scale is at play in the Dune universe, and man oh man did he nail it with STYLE. I can't think of a better adaptation of the book to the screen. The visual style is amazing, the characters look and feel like their book counterparts, and the score is great (there's ample Zimmer BWAAAAAAAHs to rumble your bowels). I cannot wait to see the next installment(s?). My only complaint was that the sound effects drowned out the dialog in some scenes. Which is believable given the context, but I believe could have been mixed better because after all, this is a movie and the dialog should be heard suspension of disbelief non-withstanding.",1
498,"Epic saga, great achievement by director and Art Dept. It took great courage, hard work and fortitude to make this film. Such an admirable achievement however I was never effected emotionally. None of the characters made me care what happened to them. You do not feel sad or joy for anyone, you simply watch. You know/suppose there are good guys and bad guys as we have all seen similar storylines and events in film but as in most sci-fi, the people are secondary to the ""world"" and how it's different on the outside... . This is a mistake most often made in sci-fi as the audience never gets completely involved in the story and often finds itself thinking of other things... like how much it must of cost to have created this or that or hire so many people for battle scenes or trying to figure if they are not real but computer generated, etc. etc. I read the book too long ago to remember it and have seen other Dune movies. This was the best of them that I recall. It was a very challenging effort to take on and it achieved a film worth watching. I just wish it drew me in to the characters, especially enough to care to see Part 2. I saw this on a big theatre screen with Dolby sound, it's the only way to see it. There are times you can't hear or understand what some of the actors are saying but I found I didn't care and it didn't seem to matter. Worth seeing though, most especially if you like sci-fi.",1
499,GREAT remake of the Book.,1
500,"This is not a full :'Dune', but only Part One, and ended it where it did made little to no sense, to where the Harconans won.  The original version was too long, but this one is longer. and does not even introduce the Emperor and the reason for the decision and battle over the spice planet.  Action, effects were very good, but you cut up the plot to where Part 1 made no sense.",1
501,okay this movie was amazing and i'm so excited for the next,1
502,absolutely loved this movie! the score was incredible! had to come watch it in the theater to get the full effect! can't wait to watch again and can't wait for the next movie!,1
503,A much better version of the book.,1
504,Better then Star Wars,1
505,A hauntingly beautiful tale of redemption and fatherhood. Saul Williams is a movie star. Highly recommend. Take it in.,1
506,"Saul Williams' aging, world-weary face and the cinematography make this watchable, but the writing is basic, riddled with cliches and all-too-familiar tough-guy gangster posturing.",0
507,Pretty conventional on many levels and on most of its story beats. Has some good acting and ideas but it's stuck in usual gang story.,0
508,"This was a complete waste of time.  Did not think it could get any worse, but the ending was of course as incomprehensible as the entire movie.  Do not waste your time.",0
509,"Even gorgeous Layna Bloom can't save this film. She's fabulous and some of the ballroom scenes are hot, but the male lead gives a wooden performance as a psycho chaser and Bloom's love interest. The problem is that the audience cannot understand why a girl who looks like Bloom would go for a dismal blockhead like him. This film seems to be made with a bizarre assumption that hot trans girls will go for anyone who shows interest, any jackass that shows up at the bus terminal. The result is a film that descends into cinematic bathos that left the audience in my theater screaming BS.",0
510,Excellent from beginning to end.,1
511,"I really enjoy watching this movie it really bought a lot of mean for the trans, LGBTQ, and all gays. It definitely stands out. And tells people that regular  movies are underrated cuz there is more to it then just what is shown. And I was so proud of how far all these beautiful characters come.",1
512,Wow. This was a ride. I don't want to spoil anything about this documentary so please go in as blind as you can.,1
513,A great detective story about a Holocaust survivor with a story that is unbelievable.,1
514,"It's truly remarkable what one can convince themselves of, and it's repugnant what people will do to make a potentially huge chunka o' chizza. All of that is in play here. 
This impressive doc on the exploitation of a fake Holocaust survivor and the exploitation of actual Holocaust and war survivors for that big pay day (and the subsequent pay days from books sells, signings, tv/movie, etc.) is a compelling piece of work. 
There's a number of really repugnant people here,. But what else is old?  Well done by all involved. 3.4 stars",1
515,Misha and the Wolves is an intriguing tale that takes you in one direction before it switches completely. It's best to go into this knowing as little as possible. This journey will engage you throughout.,1
516,"A fascinating documentary, with many surprising twists, really well put together. It is about and around the Holocaust, which may trigger some.",1
517,"I took the day off from work yesterday after a long weekend to just get some R&R and ultimately just went to the movies to watch this by myself.
It was a perfect escape, what the movies are all about during a challenging era, and I just left smiling. The premise only had to make minimal sense for the film to work--all of the scenes were suspenseful and highly entertaining-- for me it was Emily Blunt and The Rock that carried the movie and made me laugh. 
No guilt about that popcorn I killed either.",1
518,"SPOILER ALERT: Yes, this is a solid documentary about an extraordinary hoax. But what made me look it up even further was because of the wrap-up text at the end... that even with Misha totally busted, the judgment against her first publisher was only partially reversed.

While I've not yet found out why that occurred, what I did discover was the Wikipedia entry for this story, which revealed facts that were even more interesting than what was in the film. For example, there were plenty of people who found Misha's tale suspect from the outset, and in the film we do meet one of them at the end. She is by far the most interesting person in the movie, and via Wikipedia, we learn there were even more like her and they all WARNED the first publisher not to publish it. Wikipedia also tells us that even the book's co-writer warned the publisher that the tale was most likely a fake. And yet all of this was omitted from the documentary. Wow.

For me, that's where the real story lies in ""Misha and the Wolves,"" as at its core is a morality tale about greed. Not only is Misha a villain for lying, but so are all those who brought her story to the world, even tho they had grave concerns about its veracity. Why is this bad? Because every dishonest Holocaust story diminishes the horror of the true ones. That's pretty unforgivable. But hey...they all still made money with this Netflix film. It's the hoax that just keeps on giving.

But that takeaway didn't come from the film. It came from a damn Wikipedia entry. Read for yourself and see what I mean: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha:_A_M%C3%A9moire_of_the_Holocaust_Years.",0
519,"Loved the movie. Hated the miserable, bitter old ladies who went after Misha in the end.",1
520,"This documentary persecutes a woman who's parents were murdered by Nazis. The trailer gives the impression that this was an extraordinary story with surprising twists and turns. From the beginning, you know that the woman who claimed to be raised by wolves is lying. In fact, it's hard to believe that people actually believed her. Then when they find out she's lying, the ""surprising turn"" is that her parents were still killed by the Nazi's, not because they were Jewish (they weren't) like she claimed, but because they were resistance fighters. Her father was considered a traitor after the war, for giving up names under torture; consequently the woman in this story grew up being called the ""traitor's daughter."" So, she grew up under Nazi occupation during a World war, her parents are murdered, she's bullied and who knows what else. She made-up a story that was, in my opinion, clearly far fetched and profited from it. It doesn't really feel like she did anything so terribly wrong. Personally, I cut her slack based on her childhood. She was wrong to lie, but people were stupid to believe her, and she had a rough start in life. The way the documentary presents the story lack intrigue.",0
521,"It's a bonkers story that would have been a pretty incredible without the lies.  There's not a lot to knock, but a twist that some may figure out early, involving one figure's participation in the film is a little bit distracting.  It's never uninteresting, and pretty easy to follow for being as complicated as it is.  If you're in the never-ending hunt for the truth, this should be right up your alley!  If you're familiar with Misha's story, you may not enjoy this as much as someone like me, who was in the fog about this until about 90 minutes ago!  A really well-made documentary.  Final Score: 8/10",1
522,What a joke! These are the same kids that were just eating tide pods 😂😂 It must be nice living in fantasy lmao,0
523,Don't understand the low score. This was like one of those old school 70s-80s type horror flicks. Back when the genre produced movies of substance. The lead character gave an amazing performance and the immersive scenary and score set the tone for one of my top 5 horror movies of the past year.,1
524,"Outstanding performance from the main character. Most of the unsettling moments come from the horrors that happen in the hospital's night shifts,  where darkness prevails due to power cuts. A great British movie with a strong gothic environment.",1
525,"Aburrida hasta más no poder, el doblaje al latino nefasto. Temática sumamente explotada, y en esta película muy mal ejecutada. Ni sus screamer logran generar interés. Nada recomendable.",0
526,"This is a new favorite of mine. It has ""A haunting in Connecticut"" vibes. Trigger warning: SA. It has a nice little twist at the end that you don't see very often.  I enjoyed it very much.",1
527,"A very dissapointing film. Like many other films this past decade, its trying to use horror elements as a symbol for real life tragedies and it fails miserably. The buildup of the first half of the movie is quite solid but half way there it loses focus and starts combining different horror techniques quite randomly. (darkness, possession). It becomes quite predictable and the ending feels very.... very rushed. There is nothing left to the imagination about what could be or not. Once you figure this movie out, (believe me you will) it has nothing else to offer you. Its a shame because the setup and the beginning of the film sounded very promising. I would suggest ''The Amulet'' since it succeeds where this film fails. Using horror as a metaphor for tragic events.",0
528,"What a discovery, one of the best horror movie of the year. Starting on pretty conventional grounds and common dark corridors scares and ends up being something really original. The pretty basic first act does not prepare you for what is coming in a totally immersive second act that is one of the best written and directed in any movie; that let you fully enjoy the terror of a spooky night in an hospital. The central performance is out of this world on every level, a knockout performance that unfortunately will not get the consideration it fully deserves. The direction is also elevating an already original script but a great construction of scares and fear. And even with all that good it has time to insert some dramatic elements and social commentaries. A must see.",1
529,"Set in 70's London, a newly hired nurse at a dilapidated hospital is made to work the night shift where she experiences some strange happenings that make her question her sanity.   This wasn't bad.  The atmosphere created was pretty effective and the acting was on point.  I enjoyed the first half, then the second half just felt a little more run of the mill horror.  Decent and worth a look either way.",0
530,"Good story, good acting, attention grabbing…loved it !",1
531,"I really enjoy the 1st and 3rd act, not much fan of the spirit girl ruin Val's life tho, but I always like a good revenge movie.",1
532,Definitely very well made but not interesting or enjoyable enough for me personally 2.4,0
533,"The visuals of this film are striking! The first half of ‘Gaia' entrances viewers just enough to be invested in the characters, however, the plot falls flat at the most pivotal moment and unfortunately leaves the audience questioning the movie's message.",0
534,Really boring and pointless plot. I didn't care about what was happening.,0
535,"TERRA TERROR
Turning the tables on the royal we destroying Earth, ""Gaia"" is a revenge fantasy where humankind gets a whiff of life as an endangered species. Sadly this is our inevitable fate, but here mother earth takes on a more pro active role. Our demise is a bizarre reforestation of sorts.

A pair of park rangers, with well meaning pro environment aspirations, trek into thick jungle waters with dire results. Of course. You can enter, but leaving is another matter. Mother Nature, in the form of a far reaching, breathing, growing, vengeful fungi comes alive at night. Plumes of spores infecting and reproducing with heaving pulses. Thick with atmosphere. Alluring cinematography. Stunning vistas. This is one succulent movie.

A couple of totally off the grid subjects (father and son) are already on board, providing much needed thread from the stunned rangers to the psychedelic goings on in this magical mushroom kingdom. What is real and what is not, is not so clear, creating a frustrating mystery aspect to the dreamy passages. It is beautiful, lush, creative and unsettling. Unfortunately the trippy trip is eventually dissected by some all too physical confrontations, steering the film into standard eco-horror fare.

Barend, the caveman like survivalist father who favours the most inappropriate of tree hugging, dresses like a caveman, owns a weird combination of encyclopedic knowledge, alchemy expertise, and a penchant for culty religious hogwash, is the most entertaining character running around the forest, yet his background and transformation from civilization are never duly explored.

What is clear is that slowly but surely, the creeping, growing organism that lies underfoot is a force of uh, nature, and there will be mayhem. Can't decide whether it is a thought-provoking cautionary tale (don't mess with nature) or slick monster flick (nature messes with you). Either way it does get messy. Pretty and messy. Pretty Messy.

An interesting and stylish take on infections, and all matters natural that we can't quite control, ""Gaia"" could have been quite powerful if handled with more restraint. Still worth a look though.

- hipCRANK",1
536,"Gaia initially impresses with a strong sense of visual style and excellent cinematography. The monster design, which was ripped off straight from The Last of Us, is no less impressive on film than in the game. At the outset the pacing of the story is actually done quite well, and although the threat of the clickers is basically non existent after the first half of the film, that's fine since there's a much more interesting story behind the father and son living in the forest and the thing they worship. But that's where Gaia just kind of...decides it's done with that now and just watch bad man die please? 
The unsatisfying final act is a huge letdown and waste of everything that comes before.",0
537,"Gaia is a sensory uncomfortable and terrifying horror piece that has all the elements needed to make you disturbed with every frame there is. The cast of this movie is pretty well selected with some strong and creepy performances from some yet falls flat at scenes when you can notice it. The characters are unique yet the protagonist is someone that most of us can relate to bringing alot of cliche ideas into her description. The plotline feels very weak to the point where it doesn't exist and the story loses you midway through the movie where you end up just going with what's shown on screen. It is disturbing and interesting at points to try and figure out the next scene that will take place and the big idea behind the movie but even with their symbolic representation, they are hidden in ways where it can feel unworth the watch. However, the visual elements are disgusting and disturbing along with a pretty well-built score and uncomfortable shots that do have you gagging throughout the movie and enough to make you pause and skip some scenes yet nothing to make you throw up. The cinematography is pretty well designed but nothing mindblowing along with some great special effects that add alot of atmospheric value to the plot. It gets boring at points but stays disturbing and slightly intriguing enough to get you through. And definitely feels like a prequel to the last of us.",0
538,"Clickers! The Last of Us! Well acted and shot, but slow and relatively inconsequential until the end, which is good. A load of quasi-religious/poetic palaver that's a bit heavy handed and almost funny in its seriousness––here comes the infection to end the world! And it will be Mom Nature who brings it. I grow fatigued.",0
539,"Dear Amazon,
Please stop making movies like this.
We don't want them anymore.

540,I'm giving it a low review based off the STRENGTH that they played into racist tropes and killed off the only Black man I'm the movie unnecessarily. Finding out this was a South African film that did this just added gas to the fire.,0

544,Funny and action packed. A lot of gratuitous violence but a feel good family story too. Well done!,1

547,Predictably violent simple storyline.,1
548,"A former FBI agent's house is robbed, his son beaten up, his daughter's kitty-cat bracelet stolen, and he does nothing about it.  He then dusts off old skills and enlists the help of his Dad and a buddy from the Bureau days to go to war with the Russian mob, which seems to be an increasingly popular topic of movies these days.  The John Wick-style climactic battle with the bad guys is a tad overdone but still great fun.  Solid acting all around and an illustration of the proper way to deal with a home invasion!",1
549,Great action film and lots of fun.  Bob Odenkirk is one of my faves.,1
550,"It is not a movie I will remember for a long time. Bob Odenkirk was good but the I just couldn't help picking the film apart. Several moments in the movie I couldn't even believe. It kinda felt like a John wick movie at times. Once again the Russians are out for revenge. It seems like the main character goes through alot of trouble just to prove that can protect his family. The action scene to close out the movie was kinda fun, but overall not worth seeing ever again. There was not enough character introduction either. I could not feel anything for the characters.",0
551,"Fun, non-stop action. And, no corny love story is involved.",1
552,It was awesome! Great surprises! Great cast! Amazing time!,1
553,Every character in Le Bal Des Folles is acted out flawlessly. Every emotion is heartfelt and genuine. Le Bal Des Folles is rich with feminine elegance that it's horrors diminish in the bright light of victorious freedom.,1
554,Thoroughly enjoyed this. Really felt like the mystical element added to the otherwise depressing historical period piece about a Women's asylum and the awful experimentations that happened there as well as the reasons they could get institutionalized.,1
555,"Allan Kardec spiritism combined with the subjugation of a french society woman in the year of Victor Hugo's death, add to the mix the inhumane treatment of the mentality ill and you have a great recipe for compelling drama.. An award worthy, very well produced, high quality period fiction. A magnificent effort from first time director Mélanie Laurent.",1
556,"My dear Geneviève, we are free…

After Oxygen, Mélanie Laurent returns directing and starring in an Amazon original.

As a director, Laurent did a great job showing the cruelty in the treatment of women in asylum back in the days. The ""therapies"" were nothing different from tortures. However, within the cruelty was the premise that added heart to the characters. I liked that the movie didn't scream feminism, but let the scenes play out so audiences could root for the women characters.

Probably my only problem was the movie became pretty predictable near the end. I liked how the two main characters were tied to each other, but what became of it was quite clear and not surprising.

Overall, a solid and well done movie. 7.5/10",1

Misguided scientists are conducting sleep experiments, attempting to capture video of their dreamers' terrible dreams...and what they finally see is unbelievably frightening.

It may be a bit artsy for some, but stick around for the excellent retro aesthetics and a killer soundtrack combined with the perturbing cinematography and convincing characters, and you'll find a surreal and bittersweet experience that shouldnt be missed.",1
561,"Not what I expected at all. It looked like sci-fi -- well, maybe it kind of is? It was very slow and there were a couple of good scary parts but the payoff was just ""MEH"" IMO. It was okay. Will not watch it again.",0

572,A true masterpiece.  Paul Verhovens best film.,1

I can't say enough about how well the cast performed in every role in this film. It's a very gripping story that, though repetitive at times, remains interesting as I found myself searching for details and differences in the perspectives of the main characters.

The events in The Last Duel are very stressful as there are real dire consequences for the Carrouges which makes the last bit of the film so intense. More people need to see this movie. Do it.",1

615,"I think this movie was excellent. It was really well written, a very poignant and moving story and was artfully and beautifully shot. This should have won best picture.",1
616,Such great insight through the eyes of a child.  Loved all of the acting and story.,1
617,"The movie was enjoyable, and captured my attention. It was heartbreaking to see what people can do for hatred. In this day as then Hate will never end.",1
618,It had great about historical prejudice and the strength of family and community. It was both sad and hopeful.,1
619,lovely and nostalgic,1
620,Enjoyed the story line and hit home,1
621,Good story. Loved it being filmed in black & white. Great sound track too!,1
622,Excellent script and the young boy is exceptional,1
623,True story with a lot of heart!,1
624,"Scenes last over and over , not realistic i mean how could child hit djinn over and over,sorry,but so unrealistic and boring,however it includes some ideas 💡",0
625,"Surprising little low budget, under-the-radar horror movie that was a pleasant surprise! If you're a fan of the horror genre, I would recommend this one. It might surprise you!",1
626,"Very well-crafted and an engaging performance from the lead actor! However, it does fall to the indie-horror weakness of filler shots that slow the action.",0
627,"Okay movie. If youve seen any horror movie then you've seen this. Nothing fresh or original in this movie. It drags and takes forever for something to start happening. Predictable, low budget but still isnt as bad as other movies I've seen. Its not THAT bad but its not good either.",0
628,"This is low budget, unscary, cliched and ridiculous. I mean 'the book of shadows' puleease.  Why is his asthma a part of the story?  There's no logical reason. Why doesn't he leave the house instead of running around inside it and hiding?  Because there would be no movie if he did. Yet another movie with high rating on rotten tomatoes that I just didn't want to waste my time finishing.",0
629,This was a 15 minute short stretched out to 82 minutes by moving at a snail's pace and repeating scenes. Some of it makes no sense and some makes even less sense (if that's possible). Basically The Djinn is a version of the monkey's paw and it telegraphs the ending while wading through molasses to get there.,0
630,Excellent low-budget horror movie. Very well produced.,1
631,"The Djinn is this very elegantly constructed, highly minimalist horror flick that was done on a shoestring budget, but still it felt surprisingly competent at generating chills and at telling its unexpectedly emotional story. The pacing is at first rather slow, but the second half is excellent, the main child performance is so good and the movie's simplicity was ultimately its biggest strength. It's an underseen horror gem.",1
632,"First of all, I do not like long hair on boys (it makes them look effiminate) so I deduct one point for that, but this was a really good movie even if the ending stinks a little, but the Djinn does grant his wish, but at the expense of his father.  a very good suspenseful movie starring a new talent, thus my *4* stars rating!!!!",1
633,Thank you A24 and Ezra for this amazing little beast of a horror film proving a great film can be made for very little. I loved it. 10/10 stars,1
634,"Really good music (as expected from Lin-Manuel, Miranda) and emotional story. I liked all the characters, even the ones that I disliked at the beginning",1
635,"I'm not surprised that Vivo flew under the radar with audiences. Musically, the soundtrack feels like the B-sides of Lin-Manuel Miranda's discography. The songs are catchy in the moment, but I can't remember the tune to any of them now that the movie is over. Even though the story is fine and there is some good emotion portrayed, I thought the comedy was lacking. I also found Gabi to be fairly grating. And since that character was the main human focus of the movie, it really dragged the whole thing down for me. It's not a bad movie. My kids seemed to enjoy it. I just don't care to see it again.",0
636,"I freaking love this movie the monkey thing is so cute and he is so good at playing the flute. Gabi is ugly and lowkey rude but she was sweet at the end of the movie. My spanish teacher showed me this movie at school and i now want to be Vivo when i get older. 
goodbye xoxo 
jenna",1
637,"Lin-Manuel Miranda, the narcissist himself yet again comes out with a film starring himself as main character. The lyrics and music are horrible and the story is bad. All of the characters looked like the awful kroger mascots. Gabe has no character development the only people that change are the people around her making her a terrible human being. I want to drown vivo in a bucket of water and I want to see this movie fail. If I see or hear that horrible singing rat I will guzzle bleach so fast you won't even have time to say, ""no.""",0
638,"Vivo was another of Lin-Manuel Miranda's many films in which the narcissist himself cast himself as the main character. Gabe had no character development making me hate her. All of the characters look like those butt-ugly kroger mascots. Vivo's little fedora make me want to take that little kinkajou and drown him in a bucket. The music is awful and I want to die after I heard the sheer amount of awful chords, lyrics, and autotune. I want this movie to fail and I will forever hate it.",0
639,Not a masterpiece. But very strong movie.,1
640,"Honestly, this movie warms my heart and its songs have been on my On repeat playlist on Spotify since I first saw it. Thank you, Lin-Manuel Miranda.",1
641,"Espetacular, trazendo uma grande reflexão! Muito bom!",1
642,Not bad. An enjoyable movie for children.,1
643,I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and a relationship with Vivo and the older man. The little girl was tough and I would imagine that was the point of her as a character but for me Becky was sooo unbearable its just annoying.,1
644,"As the movie within the movie within the movie develops, your enjoyment will largely depend on how hard you want to work.  I wasn't in the mood to take an exam, so while it's beautiful, it's also another example that you need a script.  And isn't that the irony of all ironies.  A film about well you know, has a lot of filler and not enough meat on the bone.  The performances are worthwhile, but characters disappear and then show up in another place which is ultimately confusing.  Final Score: 5.8/10",0
645,"This is quite a solid, thoughtful film, with a real holiday/escapist feel to it. I liked the main performances and I liked that its essentially a story within a story, with the lady telling her idea for a potential film, to her husband, who is a successful director. I liked that it has a laidback feel, almost like the TV series (or film, if your in the US and saw the theatrical version) of the 'The Trip' series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. I enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it, especially if your a fan of Bergman's work, as while this isn't all about Bergman per se, it may interest fans for the various inevitable Bergman references.",1
646,"An hour of buildup where we run into cinephile after cinephile that has decided to make the pilgrimage to the island of Fårö to see where Bergman drew inspiration, as well as shot many of his most famous films, before running into a group of locals that just watch these weirdos trying to find the ruins of a house exterior torn down decades earlier. 

My first exposure to the work of French writer-driector Mia Hansen-Løve, Bergman Island is a slow work that puts much of Bergman's thematic work into a modern context, removing much of the ponderous nature without taking away the slow pacing and adding some meta elements. Bergman himself is referred to as this almost godlike being, who has eclipsed humanity and exists only as a bundle of philosophical musings and unreachable genius. While going through the motions of being awestruck in this holy ground, our protagonists Chris and Tony (Vicky Krieps and Tim Roth) put the themes Bergman explored to more practical use in a human context, while also exploring the role of the artist in the art as a film concept that Chris has developed bleeds into her real world struggles. 

The acting is solid, the allusions to Bergman's own work actually feel relatively sharp, and the story-within-a-story (which then melds with the 'real' story) seems like a creative plot design, but this film just never really connected with me. The slow pace, lack of objective plot development, and ambiguous ending make sense for a simmering domestic conflict, but might not have been what I was looking for on a Tuesday night. Might be worth a follow-up in the future with a different perspective to take advantage of the film's more distinctive elements. (3/5)",0
647,"I always want to give slow, boring movies a chance and stay with it in hopes the 2nd half comes to life. This one never did and I feel it was a waste of my time. A really bad story line that included very boring people. This could have been so much better with a script that gave their stories some depth.",0
648,"Approaching this as someone with a limited exposure to both famed Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman, (the only Bergman film I've seen is Wild Strawberries during a course I took decades ago) and this film's French writer-director, Mia Hansen-Love, (a name I've come across mainly on T-shirts), what's unmissable in this loving tribute and homage from the latter to the former, is its resolutely and potentially irksome indie film traits and sensibilities and its almost playful narrative layering that can be intriguing and navel-gazing in equal measures. Vicky Krieps and Tim Roth play a film-making couple who came to Fårö, the Swedish island home of Bergman, for inspiration and to work on their respective projects when friction and distractions begin to test their relationship. Reality blurs with fiction when the screenplay Krieps's character is writing comes to life in a film-within-a-film where Mia Wasikowska's American director Amy rekindles a love affair from her teenage past with Anders Danielsen Lie's Joseph at a wedding set on the same island. On paper, and even as I watch the film, dreading the inevitable indie-tainted ambiguous ending, I should've found this pretentious and perhaps unsatisfying, yet I find myself engaged enough to happily continue watching. It helps that this is rather beautifully put together with a certain understating grace to it; while a little post-film research uncovering Hansen-Love's 15-years relationship with fellow French director Olivier Assayas further deepens my understanding of where this film came from. The story won't raise anyone's pulse and the answers you seek will typically not be forthcoming in the endings (twice over, in fact) but, as if channelling Bergman's own Scenes From A Marriage, there's also something original and oddly captivating here in its treatise on both a flailing relationship and an artist's creative process that ultimately connects with me.",1
649,Mythical Faro Island? The Faro Islands do exist. Your blurb needs a rewrite. The movie is well acted and the cinematography is good. The pace is really slow and finally there is not much to the story.,0
650,"I don't think many people will like this movie.  I am not sure what to say about it except that I found it very moving.  An introspection on creativity, appreciating art, and existing.",1
651,"The synopsis for BERGMAN ISLAND sounds interesting. If only that were true. While there was the hint of a plot, it is very weak, boring, and seems entirely pointless. I learned a little bit about Ingrid Bergman and that was mildly interesting. But the story was a waste of time despite the presence of some good actors (Vicky Krieps, Tim Roth, Mia Wasikowska). There is essentially nothing going on in this movie. I'd recommend avoiding it.",0
652,"Bergman Island is a highly intelligent, emotionally resonant film that although not having a demanding plot really struck a chord with me. Based on some of the best writing and acting of recent times this is a film to savour and enjoy in equal amounts. Tim Roth and Vicky Krieps play a film making couple, Tony and Chris,  who make a journey to Faro Island off the coast of Sweden. Faro is known as the island of Ingmar Berman, the legendary film director. He lived and died there and many people go there as a kind of pilgrimage. They are both seeking inspiration and the film deals mainly with their realationship and their creative spirit. The film takes an interesting turn when Chris begins to explain to Tony her idea for a film, which then comes to life before our eyes. A film inside a film about a young couple reuniting on Faro. It's very clever and works very well thanks to some excellent writing as well as great performances from Roth, Krieps and Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie as the young couple. This is a very charming film that I loved quite a bit. A lovely look at romanticism and the creative spirit.",1
653,One of my favourite films of 2021. The last half hour is absolutely splendid in terms of storytelling. Such a little gem of a movie that takes its time but manages to tell a story that feels both familiar and strangely original.,1

662,Hard to follow. Some parts had you on the edge of your seat. Disappointing ending.,0

666,"Started out intriguing but slowed down and got boring fast. It's no Cincinnati Kid. If the main character has to explain what he's doing, who cares. Isaac, who I like, is pretty emotionless - maybe the card counting carries over to his character and makes him borderline dull. Haddish is wasted in an underwritten role. The ""ending"" derails and both makes little sense and involves things Isaac should've seen coming a mile away simultaneously. Schrader's a bad director and hasn't written a good script since ""Taxi Driver"". Without Scorsese as an Executive producer, I doubt this even gets made. It probably shouldn't have. Save your money.",0
667,Terrible. Waste of time,0
668,Great acting good photography and music. Plot is at times intense and interesting others it loses tension and it becomes rush and confusing,0
669,Intense. Great acting. Heavy story pacing intentionally slow.,1
670,boring. slow. not enough plot to keep interest.,0
671,"it had that good slow burn that I like but I feel they could have showed how Mr. Issac transitioned to card counting expert a little more exactingly.  He got good at his craft but no way he was good out of the gate. They didn't  have time to develop that though. and nothing against Tiffany Haddish but I didn't understand why she was there which left me feeling her part was manufactured just to make her a part of the story. a bit disconnected, but she did play her role very well. like most comic actors, they nail dramatic roles when given a chance.",1
672,"So slow and horribly written.  Plotline left many gaps and questions.  Oscar's acting, as always was fabulous, but disappointed in Tiffany's debut in drama.  Kept wanting to push fast forward on my remote, but in the theater and did not have one.  I really want my money and time back.  You should pay me.",0

674,Like being at an actual Broadway Musical,1

679,Phenomenal! I cried literally half of the film. Can't wait to watch it 700 more times at home.,1
680,If you enjoy musical theatre dont miss this.,1
681,Really enjoyed this. Glad i got to see it in theatres rather than on Netflix,1
682,Not a single moment wasted.,1
683,"I took theater in high school and a class in college but I wouldn’t consider myself apart of that crowd and I’m not the biggest Broadway person. This film feels very Broadway and it’s what you would expect the directorial debut of Lin-Manuel Miranda with all that being said I loved this one! Andrew Garfield is a absolute STUD throughout the movie, dude can sing! The whole cast was brilliant. Lin really told the story of Jonathan Larson so well.",1
684,Beautifully made documentary! A must see.,1

688,A Belgian piss-take of a film but somebody please explain me the end.,1
689,"Like The Rise of Leslie Vernon, this deconstructs slasher tropes and puts them in a fun and ridiculous high concept idea. Evan Marsh is an engaging lead as the final boy that has to survive a night of various serial killers trying to get him. I have a feeling this may be headed for cult film status.",1
690,Very funny horror/comedy!,1

694,"As stated in the title... A fun homage to serial killer films, with an interesting array of characters that each have familiar elements to them. The story is fairly basic, but the film does what it needs to do (much like 'Freaky') and ends up being an enjoyable, genre defining watch.",1
695,"Of the bat great lighting always a sign the filmmakers are passionate about making the film look and feel quality but probably made on a shoe string. Fun, dark and with lashings of gore with one kill I've never seen before and I've seen a lot of horrors. Lots of homages to various films of the 70's and 80's from Back to the Future, Assault of precinct 13 to various horrors. Definitely for ones that love horror with comedy.",1

699,"I love the blend of acting and real interviews that made this film so compelling. I have watched movies that are solely re-enactments of events and documentaries that are solely interviews and description, but neither by itself can fully portray the gravity of what has happened. It made it entertaining, but also informing. It's not the best film of this style that I've seen, (shout out to ""Pepsi, where's my jet?"") but it's definitely up there. Would recommend.",1
700,"It helped me get my point of not going to college to my parents easier, that is why I like it more. Very informative, but I don't like when they recreate stories AND have a documentary!",1
701,"As a newcomer to the world of documentaries I believe Operation Varsity Blues was pretty gripping. There wasn't much of any shock factors, however the film portrays the situation in great (but not excessive) detail enough to make it a watchable experience. I must say that 'reenactment scenes' sound generally cringe but due to these being almost a 'word to word' reenactments, they truly were not that bad. The thing that struck out to me the most must be the story of Standford's sailing teacher. Honestly, it is hard not to feel bad for him. I wish him well. He seems like a good person.",1
702,"Operation Varsity Blues The College Admissions Scandal - 7/10. Chris Smith, who directed the great Fyre documentary, returns with the docu/reenactment film about the college admissions scandal. Diving into the history of the man who created the whole process of making rich and entitled kids get into the best colleges, the documentary reenacts these incidents and shows the convos that lead to the events to happen. Smith interviews individuals directly and indirectly involved with the case, and the documentary shows how the admission process is flawed and filled with loopholes. Whats sad about the documentary is that there is a sense of dread and sadness attached to it. Though it exposes the loopholes, it also shows the pain and effects it has on young people that haven't been accepted. The discrepancy between the wealthy and the rest is brilliantly shown through the doc, and Smith does a good job of using vlog footage to capture how much an admission means to young people. As a documentary it feels like it could have been a little more engaging. Otherwise, its a good documentary that will make you think about how unfair advantages are for the privileged.",1
703,"Eh... Pretty boring to me. The production quality was decent, but it actually made me care even less.",0
704,"The side door comes at a price.  Meet Rick Singer (Matthew Modine).  He's uniquely positioned to assist families in getting their children into prestigious colleges if they can make a sizable donation to his company.  The catch?  He's built an empire upon fraud.  Now, I can't say that I have a background in this scandal.  It's not surprising in the slightest that this happened; I just missed the majority of the story.  I only peripherally heard about Lori Loughlin because she was the most famous person involved, but even then, I was not overly familiar with her as an actress, so I didn't investigate further into the crime.  The bumpers that Netflix auto-played looked intriguing, and the only kicker I needed to hear was that this is from Chris Smith, the same documentarian that made one of my favorite pieces, Fyre.  I can't say that Operation Varsity Blues is the better-made film, but the subject matter is just as fascinating.  Now I think it would be a fair assessment to say that Operation Varsity Blues gets by on the strength of the material.  It is an engrossing case with lots of juicy details to pull from, and while this primarily consists of reenactments, all of the dialogue is pulled from the actual tapped phone calls.  I think that this functions as a double-edged sword.  While the authenticity is there, the performances tend to ring a bit hollow.  There are several parts in this where the acting comes off as wooden and stilted, and it feels like the direction was to stay word perfect to the script instead of giving actors free rein to add personal touches.  Also, because these are recorded phone calls, it makes it so you're just watching people pace around on the phone, which is never overly engaging.  Where this documentary succeeds is by pointing out the flaws in the system.  These are privileged people who are stacking the deck further in their favor, so you never really feel sympathy for them, but the real villain is the system itself.  Higher education has been an exceedingly lucrative business, so much so that it isn't all that surprising that you have people going through these drastic measures to get an edge.  Since there is so much money to be made, it makes it just about impossible to change the machine, so what can you do?  I feel somewhere between lukewarm to positive about this.  I wouldn't mind watching more of Chris Smith's documentaries, but as a reviewer, I have to say that this doesn't have that same pop that Fyre had.  It makes you want to do more research on the subject matter, so it does its job in that regard.  Honestly, I think I would rather see a two-hour dramatization instead of this documentary.  I can see it succeeding more.",0
705,"""Operation:  Varsity Blues"" is a well made documentary about one of the most notorious scandals in history.  I like that the producers of the documentary decided to do reenactments of the many phone conversations recorded by FBI agents during the sting operation.  That in my opinion is a better way of approaching things than just listening to audio.  The documentary also does a good job of showing how the FBI managed to bring in people involved in the scandal by using Rick Singer to lure them in.  Another positive thing is how the athletic officials at the various colleges and universities involved in the scandal allows them to give their side of the story as to why they participated in the scandal and did not just brand them as greedy criminals.  The best thing in my opinion occurs at the end of the documentary when journalists and college officials say that a college education does not mean anything less if you attend a lesser known college or university.  That is what should be important.  The education itself, not the college or university you received it from.  If you want a clear understanding of the events leading up to this particular scandal, ""Operation:  Varsity Blues"" is a good place to go for that understanding.",1
706,Mildly interesting presentation but I did appreciate hearing the actual recordings.,0
707,"Netflix's Operation Varsity Blues takes its name from that given to the FBI investigation that eventually brought 33 parents of stupid kids along with the orchestrator of the bribery scandal, Rick Singer (who at time of writing is still to be sentenced) to justice – well justice of a sort.

Apart from knowing about Felicity Huffman's involvement, and her resultant two weeks in prison as penance, I didn't really follow the college scandal as it unfolded, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested. Whether or not you have kids of, or coming up to, college age, you're going to want to watch this. If only to enjoy the delicious schadenfreude of seeing the over-privileged take a fall.

Rick Singer, the college staff who knowingly colluded with him, and the wealthy parents who took advantage of his ‘side door' to buy their child a place in college should face the repercussions of their illegal actions.

The lengths some parents went to and the serious amount of money they spent – I'd say $500,000 was serious money, wouldn't you? – on fraudulently getting their kid into college was staggering. Even at $2,500/hour for a high-end college counselor, that's enough for 200 hours tuition. Quite frankly, if your kid still can't score high enough to get into college legitimately after all that, maybe they should look at another career path. One that doesn't require a college degree.

Although the length of sentences handed down to the parents who participated in the scam were of questionable sufficiency, prosecuting everyone involved was necessary. However, what Chris Smith's gripping documentary reveals – to the childless among us at least – is that the cheating scandal was just a symptom. The real scandal is the college system. The immense pressure put on kids to succeed, to score highly on their SATs and get into an elite college. There's an undeniable cachet about a degree obtained at universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford or USC. No wonder the vain, wealthy parents went to such lengths to get their stupid kids in.

And what of the kids of the cheating parents? The lesson learnt by the children of parents who paid for their acceptance into college is that it's okay to lie and cheat to get what you want. So, they grow up to be every bit as arrogant and self-entitled as mom and dad. But then, when you grow up in the rarified world of the über rich that's probably a foregone conclusion anyway.

Even for kids who legitimately get into college on merit, they face leaving with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. If I had kids, I'd tell them to forget about a college degree and become an apprentice and get paid while they learn a trade. If we've all learnt anything from COVID it's that essential workers are essential for a reason. People will always need electricians, plumbers and mechanics.

And there are some interesting urban scenes from Budapest, as well. -- The plot was interesting, and it was difficult for me to imagine how it would be resolved. But it did come to a satisfying conclusion. -- I loved hearing the Hungarian. Because it comes from a non-Indo-European language family, you'd sort of expect many Hungarians to not look very European, and yet they do. That's an interesting puzzle to mull over.

It just left me feeling tense, disgusted and angry that the murderer got away with everything without a single consequence. There was nothing redeeming about the film. It wasn't entertaining. There wasn't any kind of message. I don't know why this film was made. The dialogue was also obviously improvised, which made it cringier. And the final act of the murder scene wasn't even credible. The only thing I liked about the film was the beautiful outdoor scenery and the cabin exteriors.",0
726,One of the worst movies ever made. And I don't say that lightly. My god was it bad,0

728,"My favourite movie of 2021. A breathtaking gut punch of a movie. Unbearably hard to watch at times. Yes, kind of a rape revenge film, but one in which the victim seems to be just as much a perpetrator as a victiim. One that conveys the revenge as disproportionate to the crime. Not to relativize or downplay, but to question the nature and futility of revenge itself (and the tropes of the film genre it operates in). It also subverts the genre by basically reversing the male gaze. Co-writer, co-director and star Madeleine Sims-Fewer and her collaborator Dusty Mancinelli did a hell of a job of creating a movie that is as thought provoking as it is daring and disturbing. It's also graphically violent at times. A must see.",1
729,"Possibly the most dragged out film of it's genre. 
An arrogant excess of unnecessary shots with those that were necessary being far too long. Editing is clumsy at best. 
Thematic is weak and story not very inspired. The overbearing use of close ups is tacky and gimmicky rather than refined.
10 minute long cleaning montage and hair tying montage.
1 hour 40 made to feel like 4h.",0
730,An interesting dramatic approach to the rape & revenge genre with stunning visuals but a little too chatty for its own bad. The actress/director is fully invested on both sides and has some interesting idea but indeed the title's plot point is not the strongest moment and even appears undermined by the weak choice that will have your suspension of credibility at play. The use of only extrem close up is rather intelligent. The revenge part is from far the most striking part of the film.,1
731,"I don't get all the great reviews and blurbs. I found this movie boring and not very cogent. Sure, it's a harrowing tale, but it is a tale that could have been told more effectively in half its way too long running time. Most shots are 30% too long at least; and even though there is a lot of beautifully shot establishing stuff, it gets tiresome after the third time, and whatever symbolism is there is kind of rote and not very compelling. One of the oldest problems in cinema: you have a forty minute story at most, and you milk it to try to make it more ""resonant"" and ""gut-wrenching,"" and you add all this confusing backwards and forwards in time stuff that doesn't help either. These ""artistic"" flourishes don't add power, they subtract. Interminable scenes meant to shake me up just bored me to death. Just watched the trailer again after a year or so, and I remember nothing about the movie. NOTHING.",0

735,"This movie was slightly better than the first movie. The plot of the story was more interesting but it does need some development with the characters and the plot. It was more entertaining but it wasn't a mind-blowing cinema. Overall, this film was okay not horrible but not amazing either.",0
736,"If you love Friday the 13th then this movie will definitely be one of your favorites. They gave a great character introduction, a great middle of the killing spree and a good almost ending, imagine how awesome it would have been as a stand alone movie. There was alot happening int this movie, one thing after another, compare to all three movies, all the actors in this movie feels like they have the best chemistry together. 
The killings in the movie was far more hard hitting, it was brutal and full of blood and guts. The killer didn't walk past other people or do weird things, it was simplified, one person just going on a killing spree and the rest have to hide. 
The cinematography in this movie was really good, the seeing in the camp felt way more open and the you could get a sense of the direction of the camp, and even though it's a small camp and not like in part one where they had the whole city, the way they shot this movie felt less isolation than the first one. The sound in this movie was absolutely amazing, the songs in the radio that they played, the score that sounded similar to the movie aliens and dialogue that was very clear. 
Everything in this movie was done right, story, characters, visuals and it's sound. This is a fun movie but I don't feel like watching all three back to back again.",1
737,"The best one in the trilogy, thanks to the setting and the actors.",1
738,Only good installment in the trilogy. Saddie Sink carries hard. The relationship with her sister is good and the camp stuff is fun and makes for an interesting horror film although cliche its a fun time at the movies.,1
739,"Better than the first, because it doesn't waste time with all the teen drama forced melodrama and get to the point rather quickly.  that said the Sunnyside campers are boarder line insane and unlikable.  Which may be part of the curse but it doesn't make it any less annoying.  And I really love that these movies really EARN that R-Rating.  Like the good old days before the MPAA really became tyrants to the art of movies.  A must see for fans of late 70s and 80s gore fest.",1
740,"slightly better than the first installment, but for sure not on the level of some of the heavier hitters from recent years that have earned the 87% mark from critics. The exposition was distracting at times. The characters were ok, but I didn't care about many of them. The turn from good to evil for the axe murderer was...rushed to say the least. overall, Sadie Sink is a standout, once again, but most of the other actors are not great.",0
741,"Probably a little worse than the first, possibly because it feels like a rehash. The themes, character dynamics and limited expansion of the lore make this sequel seem more like a reboot or remake than a necessary continuation. The weakest link is the contrived characters and their forced, expository portrayal. However, Sadie Sink is a captivating lead and the film goes by surprisingly quickly. Though it's arguably inessential, it remains a perfectly pleasant, competently created horror option.",0

747,This was the best western I have seen,1
748,"Im not a western fan, but seeing a mainly Black cast in a well-acted film was great. From the gruesome start to the satisfying end, theres not a lot to complain about. Even the soundtrack was on point. The Harder They Fall is a fictional 2-hour revenge story about a real outlaw gang, presumably in the 1895 Arkansas-Oklahoma area. The style of this movie is a solid mixture of western atmosphere with a modern swagger with a more likely face-to-face outcome. With outlaw Nat Love on a mission to kill all responsible for his torment, he prematurely thinks hes done before later discovering the one main outlaw responsible, Rufus Black, will be released from prison. From there, each lead outlaw, Love and Buck, assemble gangs to assist in their mission. The film is two hours long, but every scene, character, and word spoken was entertaining and relatable. Loves path of revenge was filled with so much excitement, his charisma alone could have carried this movie. The same could be said for nearly every character. Rufus Black was a cold, straight-to-the-point, business-minded outlaw looking to regain his empire. The rest were paired up with their counterpart – The fastest draws dueled it out, both women battled, and so on. As entertaining as The Harder They Fall is, I would be surprised if they didnt make a sequel.

762,It was a really fun adaptation of a Twitter story. Amazing to see the progression of films being made from moments I saw personally happen. The movie was a bit short but thats due to the nature of the story. I did have a problem seeing Jason Mitchell back on the big screen after knowing he abuse and mistreated women on sets he worked on. His role was particularly triggering and this is coming from a man.,1
763,"This is a film that depicts the dysfunctional life of an alcoholic young lady who works in a child daycare centre (nursery). First off, there's a lot of shaky camerawork, so if that bothers you then this won't appeal to you. Its a sad portrayal of someone who seemingly refuses to ever be fully sober and who is constantly on the verge of being in serious trouble at work. She lives in a dreamworld and it's sad to watch. The shaky camerawork I suppose emphasises the higgeldy piggeldy way she lives her life, i.e. very impulsively. It has the look of an observational documentary about it. It's an ok film, not especially good but ok. It does make you wonder what may be going on in her thoughts, what she's perhaps running from and why she is the way she is but its hardly entirely original, as far as plot lines go I suppose. I thought the main performance by Lisa Aitken was pretty good - she has the 'glazed over' look in her eyes quite a lot.

I wouldn't outright recommend it as such, no.",0
764,"Driven by the seemingly fragile performance of Deragh Campbell, this portrait, shot almost exclusively on a close-up basis (which is, in itself, a brave move), is not just a story about mental health (in parts it reminds Melancholia, by Von Trier) but, also, of feminine freedom and, as  Varda's Vagabond, it challenges the viewer on various levels, asking (indirectly) questions about limits, until when such freedom will be socially accepted.",1
765,"Like the wife said: お見事です。日本負けだ。
This movie wins.",1
766,"Wife of a Spy, a historical drama set in Japan during the early days of World War II, centers on Yū Aoi as Satoko Fukuhara, the wife of a businessman (Takahashi) whom she slowly suspects may be a spy for the United States. Be warned, if you're looking for a tense, taught thriller that showcases the art of spycraft, intrigue, and narrow escapes, Wife of a Spy is not that. Instead, it's a solid character driven film devoid of any bombast or spectacle. The film takes its time letting the audience get to know the characters before upending Satoko's happiness, plunging her into a world of lies and deceit.

As Satoko is slowly drawn in to Yūsaku's world, her transition from timidity to confidence is almost immediate, making game-changing decisions that forces Yūsaku to include her into his plans. Hunting the couple is Masahiro Higashide as Taiji, an ambitious and recently promoted member of military police. Taiji, a childhood friend of Satoko, brings the tension to the film as his affections for Yūsaku's wife make for source of emotional conflict for Satoko. While not on screen often, Higashide plays the brooding, power hungry officer well, and shines in his final confrontation with Aoi. The final resolution is painful and melancholic as audiences are taken through the ride of 1940s Japan to settle at the final days of the war.

Starring Yū Aoi and Issey Takahashi, Wife of a Spy's main strength lies in its acting. Issey Takahashi's relaxed, almost informal body language conveys a sense of confidence, of self assuredness in the actions he's taking against his home country. Takahashi is equal parts charming and affable as he moves through the film, interacting with businessmen and officers of the law alike in an easy manner that almost appears effortless. It's this disarming nature that beguiles both the characters and us the audience, and it's only when Yūsaku's plans are fully revealed that we realize just how calculating Yūsaku has been the entire time.

Still, for all of Takahashi and Higashihde's prowess, the star of the film is Yū Aoi as the titular spy's wife. Aoi's transition from happy housewife to woman of conviction to something entirely different by the movie's end is played masterfully by Aoi as Satoko navigates through the twists and turns of the story. Alternating between ignorance, anger, fear, and confidence, Aoi employs a full acting clinic as she carries the film.

Directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Wife of a Spy burns slow, but never manages to bore. Within its 115 minute runtime, Kurosawa has created a world of 1940s Japan littered with possible friends and possible foes. Never explicitly stating who the Fukuharas can and can't trust, the audience is left just as wary as the characters are in their decision making. Kurosawa bring a realistic feel to the movie, choosing to use natural light often to illuminate his characters, helping to lend credence to the period piece. The almost Hitchcockian feel of the film is expertly handled by the veteran director, and while the Wife of a Spy never quite reaches the level of thrills that say Rear Window or Vertigo provide, it still manages to craft a solid story featuring hidden motivations and crisis of identity.

Overall, Wife of a Spy is a competent thriller that manages to keep the audience engaged and guessing throughout. Thanks to a shocking third act twist that's sure to catch viewers off their guard, the film is elevated from standard spy fare to something deeper and more appreciative of the subgenre. More focused on the themes of strong relationship ties and national pride than on espionage, Kurosawa's movie is clever in its approach to the story, choosing to stay focused on Satoko and her desires over Yūsaku's scheming. Strong performances from Yū Aoi and Issey Takahashi, as well as the direction from Kiyoshi Kurosawa combine to place it on a list of worthy must-see movies of 2021.",1
767,"It's never boring, but after nearly two hours what did we really take away from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 'Wife of a Spy'.  While gorgeous, I was let down by a tonal change in the 3rd act.  The adjustment leads to a series of choices that didn't work for me.  It's not a love story nor a particularly good spy drama so it's just a middle of the road time waster that you won't remember in a few days.  It's way more complex and layered than it needs to be and with subtitles that can be a bit daunting.  Totally missable unless you're a Kurosawa completist.  Final Score: 5/10",0

770,"This film glued me to my chair, mesmerised, and I have been giving it a LOT of thought afterwards.

It strikes me that one of the things the film is about, possibly at least one key facet of what it's about, is grief.

It's alluded to briefly in one scene. I think the Jessica character has recently lost her husband.

If so, the slow pace is utterly appropriate. Processing of grief is so glacially slow. It proceeds at its own pace.

This extends to the nature of the sound she is plagued by, it seems to me.",1

776,"That movie was the most slow, dull, just wretched and boring thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It was so slow that it gave me time to sit and contemplate my existence and whether or not it was worth it. To say that it made me wish for death would be to admit that it made me feel anything at all. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I fell asleep for a brief minute. My body was begging to get up and leave at every passing second, the only reason I didn't was because I didn't want to hurt the feelings of the person that I was there with. No. I can say that one of the greatest reliefs after having reread the description of this movie is that it will not be distributed to streaming platforms and will only be a limited run in theaters because I genuinely hate and will never trust again any of the people responsible for distributing that movie, marketing it, or anyone that had even the slightest role in producing that hot garbage. It drained my soul of everything that is happy, sad, or nothing at all. I literally feel as if my life force has been drained out of my body and hope to God that no one else ever sees this movie",0

789,"Sold as an urban mythological romance and a paean to the city of Berlin, German writer-director, Christian Petzold's new film begins with Paula Beer's mysterious and lonely Undine, an architectural historian, mid-rendezvous with her lover who's dumping her for another woman. Almost immediately after, there's a rather Germanic meet-cute which brings Franz Rogowski's shy and reserved industrial diver, Christoph, into the picture and the two begin a romantic courtship over the rest of the film. Since it was never explained what an Undine is, (for the benefit of those who like me has to google it: according to European mythology, it's a water nymph that becomes human after finding love but have to return to water if her partner becomes unfaithful) I was left rather bewildered during the film which follows closely the above mythology. Without that background knowledge, the story feels rather odd and baffling. In fact, even on reflection with the understanding what she's meant to be, there are parts of the film that still don't make total sense. Also unclear, or at least something that sits rather uneasily with me, is the juxtaposition of this mythical creature with the re-generation of the city of Berlin between WWII and its reunification that the film spends quite a bit of time on. So despite fine performances by the central leads and passionate and competent handling of the material by Petzold, I remain curious but tepid about the whole thing and I fear that a more cynical viewer such as I will not be entirely receptive to the romantic notions, both for the lovers and the city, that the film is attempting to convey. Or in the words of a parting lover: it's not you, it's me.",0
790,"The piano music and the end scene makes all the difference with this film. Mid way through I felt it was a little bland and I wasn't sure of the plot direction but I thought it was somewhat touching by the very end. The musical score makes a big difference, its subtle but certainly not non-existent. It is most certainly an understated film and it may bore some people, its very much an arty film of course and its hardly gripping viewing but its thoughtful and ok at the end. I don't think I'd have persevered with this, had I not paid to view it. This is an ok film overall, no more really.",0
791,"Word to the wise: Watch this film with an open mind! I spent the entire movie searching for an answer to oddities and came up empty handed, only to find that the explanation was something that I never in a MILLION years would have imagined. Perhaps that was my ignorance and I should have known that Undine's are water nymphs, but I have a feeling that is not common knowledge. Overall, the acting was quite good and I found the incorporation of Berlin's history to be a nice touch. I would have liked this better without the mythical tone, but can appreciate it all the same.",0
792,A nice story with wonderful actors,1
793,Beautiful reworking of an old story.,1
794,"Not sure how this will weather in my library, decent foreign film, but just wanted more. Worth a second watch? Only time will tell.",0
795,"Beer and Rogowski carry this somewhat slight work by the wonderful German director Christian Petzold. Their onscreen connection as lovers Undine and Christoph, playing off one another so well, so convincing in their love and devotion, has led to two successful films so far, though Undine does not quite match the fire of Transit.
The film could've used a bit more of the mythmaking of the Undine legend. The supernatural possibilities of that story could've fleshed out the one we see with more symbolism/imagery to create a greater overall impression on the audience. 
I'm not sure how much Petzold was trying to make correlations between the changes in Berlin over time and those in human life, how we alter the architecture of our lives with the people we love most like a city's core is replaced by attempts to improve on or leave behind less desirable memories. He falls short at times.
Also great here is Maryam Zaree as another love interest, but one grounded purely in reality, and whose love for Christoph is without question. I did quite like the final scene, down to the final image and what I took from it. I may need to see this again soon. 3.3 stars",1
796,A reasonably entertaining if somehow a little aimless fantasy/romance where a little more explanation would have gone a long way.,0
797,"A beautiful film with great characters and acting. Perhaps if I were more knowledgeable about German mythology, or water nymphs in general, I would have been better able to follow. Not much is explained about who Undine is, where she came from, or what becomes of her. Could have been much more of a movie, the director may have made it for an audience to whom Undine as a character is a familiar childhood story that doesn't need explaining.",0
798,fine movie. artistic exploration of line between realism and fantasy. a myth can have potent power.,1

I thought it was bloody awful with absolutely no redeeming or admirable qualities what-so-freakin-ever.  Completely baffled by the high marks from audiences and critics alike.,0
802,"If I wanted to watch boring 90's VHS footage for about an hour, I'd pull out my family's dusty tapes from the attic. If I wanted to spend the other hour of the film's ridiculously dragged out narrative of existential pseudo-philosophical blabberfest, I'd watch a Sunday morning evangelical service on TV - that would at least have some real meaning, in its usually boring, long, and dragged-out narrative. As if a higher power would ever allow such a wimpy, emotionally unstable and erratic person that Winston Duke's character portrayed, to make such soul-living decisions. That alone is the biggest joke of the entire film.

This film prioritizes messaging over internal logic and consistency. Although an intriguing premise, the execution is clunky, and fails to deliver in between the fine line of profound messaging, and superficial gibberish. Even the ending in the desert with all the obnoxious yelling of Walt Whitman's Song of Myself quotes, was just frustrating to watch and accept as the closure to this 124 min-long expose of nonsense.

I'm baffled at all the high praise from the critics; but I guess when you constantly question your own existence, and the reason behind this film's existence, just about anything will give you a rise. There are many better films out there in this genre with better messaging and more entertaining. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, for the exceptional performances and great score.",0

'Tis a rare cinematic beast that presents an original, thought provoking premise, and executes it stumble free to perfection. Many a bold visions lose their direction halfway through the popcorn box, but not here. Not an easy task, considering the heady subject matter.

Without spoiling with the spoilers, a tricky thing with this one, ""Nine Days"" tackles the human soul, questions the existence of existence, and offers a thrilling treatise on the meaning of life, whatever life is.

Last seen towering in the Marvel Universe, the imposing Winston Duke slips into the calm, assuring and almost folksy body of Will, a gatekeeper of sorts, tasked with determining the fate of several candidates vying for the job of their lives. A meticulous, calm, slow paced figure, gentle and empathetic, Will does not take his decisions lightly. For various reasons, some obvious, some to be discovered. His portrayal is magnificent. It carries the film.

Playing out like the antithesis of ""The Apprentice"", or perhaps ""Survivor"", instead of superficial fluff ""Nine Days"" unfolds (patience is rewarded) by asking important questions. Questions that resonate for everyone involved (the audience as well). How all this is created - a totally unique, psychological, spiritual mystery that feels earthy - is half the magic of the movie.

Usually a thought-provoking arrow shot up in the air will have a limited, if devout target, but ""Nine Days"" touches such a universal subject that it may become quite the sensation. The talkie is officially back in vogue, and a reading of Walt Whitman's ""Song of Myself"" is the perfect cherry on this delicious thespian cake. Yummy.

There is no insight and really only a couple moments that make me say, 'Ah. That is a somewhat interesting way to remind me of what I already know so well.' But the actual drifting has its moments of okayness.  4.4 out of 10.",0
809,"Sometimes a certain horror film comes around and hits you like a ton of bricks. The nature of low-budget horror always intrigues me a lot. The kind of creativity that this type of film pushes onto its creator is fascinating, and Censor's Prano Bailey-Bond most definitely showcases pure talent. 

There's not much fresh necessarily or any type of new filmmaking being invented but the different uses of camera movement and the switching of reality and dreams help set a terrifying tone. I will always watch this film during October because of the bleak mood in the ""real life"" scenes and the dreamy, sentimental, and freaky scenes during the ""other"" scenes. Everything comes together perfectly to set up a perfect ending that will leave you with both answers and questions.",1

811,"VIDEO NASTY
It's 1984, you can tell by the chorded phones, but more importantly by the explosion of horror VHS tapes. A banned film loophole, tapes bypassed the cinema system, allowing the production of what was salaciously labelled in Margaret Thatcher's Britain as Video Nasties. These were convenient targets in the rising crime blame game and made for perfect tabloid fodder. A rating system was quickly cobbled in place, and a dedicated team of censors with sharp scissors decided the fate of the new art form. It was an interesting time.

As bookish, spectacled and hair-bunned Enid, Niamh Algar is delightfully stoic as a choice cutter who seems unaffected by the steady stream of B-movie drek she has to wade through on a daily basis. Enid debates screen violence with her co-workers in a professional, clinical, detached manner, like she was dead inside. Turns out a part of her may be just that, in the form of her missing sister. A mysterious disappearance from childhood days that is quite the obsession. Even though their parents want to move on, Enid is defiant and desperate to find her younger sibling. Things get interesting.

What begins as a moody mystery slowly morphs into psychological thriller as Enid traverses from her boring reality into the surreal world of horror movie making. With not so subtle nods to David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"", ""Censor"" plays with the blurry lines of fact and fiction, steadily ramping up the pitch before climaxing to a bizarre finale. Enid finally lets her hair down, the screen turns red, and things get super crazy.

Not for the squeamish, ""Censor"" becomes the film within the film, deliver some ketchuppy eighties gore, startling video style glitchy edits, a host of creepy performances, and an ending sure to fire up the discussion boards.

812,"This film reminded me of Mandy - the Nicolas Cage film (a remake, I think it was?). Its got some bright, almost neon like lighting and its partly set in the woods. It also has a strong sense of the uneasiness of morals - where does the line become drawn between fantasy, fiction and reality? of course the video nasties scare/scandal of the 1980s must have been a worrying time. I was just a kid then but I can understand where the fear came from and I don't necessarily think that things are entirely different nowadays - what with the internet and everything, no doubt there's some extreme films or videos available to watch. Anyway, as a film this does well at giving an atmospheric feel, with creepy, low noises played in the background while the main character moves about, making you wonder when the next jump scare may be. It's certainly unsettling...as it should be, I suppose. 

Sadly, one of the creepy elements is very much based on reality, something that can (and does) happen in real life but I won't elaborate, so as not to provide obvious spoilers. This is a slightly sinister and probably thought provoking watch, with a good performance from Niamh Algar, so yes, I'd recommend it.",1

818,"Original and stylish, Censor gives us a glimpse inside of the ""video nasty"" period in the United Kingdom while putting forth a psychological horror-drama. Enid (Niamh Algar) is a video censor whose job it is to determine which gratuitously violent and/or sexual films are permitted to the public. After Enid is blamed for a familial mass-murder — the killer blamed one of these ""video nasties"" for his violent outburst — she becomes the focus of a public onslaught of criticism. Moreover, Enid deals with her own history of violence, as her sister was kidnapped and possibly murdered when they were children. What becomes of the plot is interesting, but not executed very well. Like any good psychological horror, the viewer battles with what's real and what's in the protag's head. But here, there are too many similarities to Enid's own experiences for the viewer to believe these are either all coincidences or all figments of her imagination. Enid sees what she wants to see, sure, but then there needs to be clarification for what she's purposefully not seeing for there to a satisfying twist. The film touches on the concepts of Free Speech and motive for violence, but not really taking a stance one way or the other. Creepy snuff producer Doug Smart (Michael Smiley) gives a banal speech about the ""horror already being out there"" and he's just putting it on the screen. Yeah, I guess during the time period this takes place — the early 1980s — that message would've carried more weight, but the film was made in 2021 and it just doesn't have any impact whatsoever now. Censorreminded me of Saint Maud, but with much less satisfaction. The most notable use of style definitely comes when Enid is watching one of the many gory films and the beam of light cruising through the air changes from white to red and back again several times. The film has a large RT gap of 89/57 as a write this — I'm closer to the audience on this one. Something special could've really come from Censor, but that's not what I watched.",1

861,"I loved this documentary about one of my favorite writers so much, and was so moved by this story of a friendship between writer and filmmaker, that I felt compelled to contact Robert to extend my gratitude. Now go dust off your collection of Kurt's paperbacks and enjoy the rest of your summer.",1
862,"A profoundly enjoyable, funny, sad, moving, humane and metatexutal film. Just like Vonnegut's own work. 

It is, of course, a fascinating insight into one of the most witty and humane writers of the 20th century. And is beautifully shot and assembled, with plumes of smoke constantly rising from the photos of Vonnegut with his Pall Malls in had, bringing even the still images to life.

But it is also a profundly moving film about human friendship.

The documentary has been over 40 years in the making, ever since a young Robert Weide, fresh from making a documentary about the Marx Brothers, contacted his literary hero and asked if he could make a documentary about him.

Vonnegut agreed, and over the years the two became friends, so much so that he becomes part of the story, much to his own chagrin.

Much like Vonnegut would enter his own novels to interact with his characters.

So much so, that finishing the film felt like having to let go of Kurt, who had died aged 83 in 2007.

So much like the nature of much of Vonnegut's own work, we have two compelling stories, the definitive documentary about Kurt Vonnegut, and the film-within-a film about Weide's on attempts to finish the film about a man who had started out as a literary hero but had now become a close friend, celebrating his own triumphs as a director, and giving him wise advice in his personal life.

Again like Vonnegut's own work, this complex technique is achieved without feeling forced, and is a pleasure to watch.",1
863,A really great documentary. Well directed with an engaging subject. It reveals the value of friendship and artistic determination over an entertaining and moving 2 hours.,1
864,"The movie was a real mis-opportunity to tell the story of Kurt Vonnegut. It could have been formulated much better to delve into the genius, mystique of the author. Instead , what we have is the film make inserting himself, like name-dropping that he once knew Vonnegut. It was more about the film maker than the author. Such egoistical blindness. No wonder this film is mediocre. It could have been much better had the film maker left himself out of the story. We don't care about your friendship with the author. We only care about the author. Ehhhh.",0

866,"Hard to rate objectively because the filmmaker has such an amazing, loving relationship with the subject of the film, but in the end I think that serves as a strength. Will surely delight any fans on Kurt Vonnegut’s works, and will most certainly create some new ones",1
867,"Kurt Vonnegut was a fascinating figure, so a documentary 40 years in the making was well worth the wait.  Robert Weide, a close friend of Vonnegut puts himself in the film and it works.  Most of the talking heads are family and Vonnegut, but Weide does illustrate some of the writer's process which doesn't always paint him in the best light.  The footage is incredible, and when the film stays focused on the life of the American writer, it is at its best.  Final Score: 8.8/10",1

876,"If you're anything like me, then you're a big fan of horror cinema from around the world. Not that America can't put out a praise-worthy horror film, because they probably put out more than any other country. But there is often a general cookie-cutter plotline that so many American horror films seem to tread, especially the ones you see riding high at the box office. 

But horror films NOT made in America just seem to take another course altogether. They introduce types of characters you might never see in a US feature, or original ideas and concepts woven from folklore or urban legends unheard of in the Western world. They can also often be far darker and more complex than your typical Hollywood horror, in case that's something you're into. In other words, they offer something less ordinary if all you consume is American or Americanized content. 

Although countries like Japan and South Korea tend to get all the attention when it specifically comes to Asian horror cinema, Indonesia has also left its mark on this particular genre of film. Especially as of late, putting out applauded efforts like The 3rd Eye (2017), Satan's Slaves (2017), and May the Devil Take You (2018), over the last few years. However, homemade horror cinema has been a thing in Indonesia for many decades now, dating as far back as 1941, when The Living Skeleton was released and considered the country's first-ever domestic horror film. 

Flash forward 80 years and Indonesia is still producing quality horror cinema, including the Shudder original The Queen of Black Magic, which is actually a loose remake of a 1981 Indonesian horror classic of the same name. In fact, the filmmakers of this updated version even pay homage to the original by featuring scenes of it during the end credits. That's not something you'd typically see in an American horror remake, of which there are numerous. 

The Queen of Black Magic is set in modern day Indonesia and focuses on three men who take their families to visit the orphanage they grew up in together, as the man who helped to raise them has fallen ill. The orphanage is isolated and is still in operation, though most of the children have apparently left for a field trip by the time they arrive. Besides the sick old man, the only other people present are a pair of older orphans and the couple who run the place, and who happened to be raised in the orphanage themselves alongside the three men, Hanif (Ario Bayu), Anton (Tanta Ginting), and Jefri (Miller Khan). 

The Queen of Black Magic takes an approach also unfamiliar to American audiences, in that it uses black magic, of course, as the concept behind what is happening to the characters in this film. Ironically, the first film I could think of to compare it to was the American classic The Evil Dead. Although The Queen of Black Magic is different in so many ways from The Evil Dead, there are some essential story lines that are present in both films. For example, it's a group of friends who travel to an isolated and distant place, they are haunted by a demonic entity, and some of the characters are seemingly possessed and made to harm themselves or others, not unlike what happens in The Evil Dead. 

But that's as far as the similarities go. The Queen of Black Magic relies on CGI for various scenes and it is blatantly obvious, which is one of the downsides to the film. Some of the decisions made by some of the characters are unexplainable as well, but unfortunately that's a commonality when it comes to this genre of moviemaking. There was nothing impressive about the sound, score, or cinematography here either, but the film tells a somewhat intriguing story, has some decent gore, and is filled with actors who know what they're doing.",0
877,Definitely had a gross factor but not much else. Can appreciate no cheesy jump scares like American horror films. I felt this had potential to be so much more but was very lackluster.,0
878,"I've watched a lot of horror/thriller movies and I must say, I loved this one. The twist and turns weren't predictable like most movies nowadays, and the whole plot perfectly portrays the word ""fear"". The revelations made it even more sick, as it shows that the primary cause of it all was man-made, and not just some baseless ghost stories and the like. The only problem I could point out was that the ending was so abrupt. It would've been better if they showed how the characters escaped their demise and how the event affected their lives. But overall it was a great ride and I wish more movies rely on the plot rather than jump scares like this movie does.",1
879,Messy and self indulgent. Didn't hold my interest,0
880,"yeah idk - i've seen others compare this to the Creep franchise, but Creep was INFINITELY better. this wasn't even on the same golf course, let alone up to par with Creep. although, it was creepy. the main girl is a walking red flag, I'm not sure how she got her boyfriend to begin with let alone keep him for as long as she did. I'm actually not sure i liked it, but it's a pretty good depiction of something - i don't know what - an aspiring filmmaker who also happens to be a little mentally unstable? lol. idk. I'm not mad i watched it, but i don't think i'd recommend this one.",0

Shakycam warning for migraine, motion sickness, and seizure patients. At first it doesn't look like it will have that, but of course it does. This filmmaker will spare no effort to make people sick.",0
882,"This movie gets half a star because in no way, shape or form did this come across as a normal film. The whole thing, from the bad scene editing to the actors not holding back their laughter during their dialogue scenes, makes this film come across as a home movie, one that any one of us could have filmed in our home and backyard with  our non-professional friends and family members. I found it on Kanopy which usually has great films, but I had to stop watching this after 10 minutes, breaking my own record of the shortest amount of time I have watched a movie before giving up on it.",0
883,Low budget indie gem that dials up the dark humour to 11. Definitely worth a look.,1
884,"Yeaahh,,,no. I still dislike the visual quality of these cell phone-made movies. I get the intention behind much of this movie, but it was more like a grating insect I want to flick away than a flick I wanna watch. 
I found the character Horvat (stop it with the 3-word names, people. Pick a last name and stick with it) plays to be awfully annoying, the writing pedantic, and the humor spotty at best. I love dark humor in general, but this wasn't even particularly funny to me. Just seemed snarky, cheap, and wanting of more focus and refinement. It felt more like an early walk-through version of a movie than a finished product. 
The acting isn't much, either. Intentionally going to the 'these are non-actors living their real lives' approach was a 'fail' for me. 
At its core, with I Blame Society Horvat is trying to tackle weighty socio-political topics. The whole film thrusts a spotlight on the gender politics of the movie business whilst also highlighting the true slog it is to be creative within the strict confines of the movie industry. They're issues that will strike a chord with many, but the manner of delivery dilutes some of the impact that Horvat is clearly pushing for. 
This is just millennial hipster movie making, imo. Guess I'm not that easily amused. Want good dark comedy? Then watch Fargo, The Death of Stalin, In the Loop, or Four Lions, not this turkey. 
2.2 stars",0
885,"Creep, Creep 2, and now we have Creep 3.

From the moment the first scene started, there's only three words that enraptured the feeling of this movie: w, t, and f. It's a unique and unbelievable dark comedy horror that opened my jaw scenes to scenes. 

On the surface, it's about a desperate indie filmmaker, and underneath that was a political and social commentary on multiple aspects of society. Although some commentary didn't land, the overall concept was incredibly clever. I was blown away from the very start, and when the credits rolled up I realized that the director/writer just outright pointed fingers at the audiences. 

By now it's clear that I love this movie. However, the movie made me feel stupid and fake, in a good way, because of I like this movie then I become the very problem that the director was aiming at. 

What a disturbing and also bizarre experience. The footage-style and extremely weird and crooked acting from the main actor just elevated the creepiness of this movie. This led to a slight negative that the footage was too smooth and high quality for a footage.

888,"Shoot To Kill - Film Review: I Blame Society ★★★1/2


Los Angeles is littered with aspiring filmmakers, some talented, while others maybe not so much. One can imagine a big fish in a little pond moving out West to discover the pond got a whole lot bigger.  The resentment, especially for those whose ambition far outweighs their creativity, spreads until it sucks all of the smoggy oxygen out of the city.  

Into this cesspit, we meet Gillian Wallace Horvat, playing a version of herself, who can't understand why nobody will let her direct a film. I've known some ""Gillians"" myself, and can attest to the veracity of what she presents here. We meet her in the middle of filming a documentary with her friend Chase (Chase Williamson) as she describes her diabolical concept. She's been told, she informs her pal, that she would make a great murderer, and she lets Chase know his girlfriend, who she claims is a terrible person, would make an excellent victim as she documents her journey to becoming the best serial killer ever. Understandably offended, Chase ends the friendship, but Gillian won't stop hurling towards her destiny.  Slowly building up to her first kill, she first stages petty thefts and break-ins, but when an unfortunate accident leads to someone's death, Gillian needs to chase that dragon more and more. 

While sitting comfortably within the ""mockumentary slasher"" genre, Horvat has bigger satirical fish to fry. By playing her character as someone who's entitlement, delusions and inability to accept criticism far outstrip her skills while also scoring points by addressing the rage a female filmmaker feels within a male-dominated industry, Horvat packs a lot into a simple concept. While always a compelling watch, she stumbles on this very meta idea by presenting herself as someone so thoroughly unlikable that it's difficult to care about her. Admittedly, Horvat has done so intentionally, giving us this sociopath with little self-awareness, but she's so good at being terrible, that I can understand why some will shrug this off as an annoying experience. Who wants to be around a horrible friend who overshares and only serves to make you feel awful?

As a sucker for the idea, however, I gleefully followed her wherever she was headed. Her frequent kills, while satisfying the gore crowd, didn't really satisfy me as much as the highly relatable scenes Gillian has with her ineffectual agent, seen only as an ear on a FaceTime call, or with two young producers (a note-perfect Lucas Kavner and Morgan Krantz) who try to use her for cheap labor while throwing out words like ""diversity"" and ""intersectionality"" (hilariously mangled as ""intersexuality"").  It would have been enough for Horvat to simply focus on the stumbling blocks women face in the film industry, but the killing spree aspect makes it more commercially viable. Clearly, she knows this world and the realities of what it takes to get a film made. She takes on a lot of self-reflexive notions, though, resulting in a seven layer dip with perhaps two layers too many. You want to root for an under-represented person, but not THIS person! 

Still, Horvat has made a highly original film which maintains its concept right up to the very, and very bloody, end. I love a badass antihero, but her skills as the filmmaker character (those hand-cranked dolly shots seem like a particularly bad idea!) don't make you want to see more.  In speaking of Horvat, the real filmmaker, I most definitely do.",1

At its heart is a study of new religion (Jehovah's Witness) in the face of fierce opposition with a double whammy of an ending.,1

English abstract

Beginning is a Georgian debut feature that swept the main awards at the last San Sebastian Festival.

Accompany Yana, a woman who abandoned her vocation as an actress to follow and accompany her husband as the leader of a community of Jehovah's Witnesses in a town in Georgia (the country), subject to a subtle domestic machismo and another more explicit social and religious, with guilt and punishment as essential inputs of domination, all this inserted in turn in an absolutely hostile national environment.

Yana's existential crisis, accelerated by an unexpected series of attacks, is radically addressed by the director, with some formal resources taken to the extreme, in a sort of biblical tragedy that goes from poetry to symbolic or verbal violence to physical.

Abstract español

Beginning es una ópera prima georgiana que arrasó con los principales premios del último Festival de San Sebastián. 

Acompaña a Yana, una mujer que abandonó su vocación de actriz para seguir y acompañar a su esposo como líder de una comunidad de Testigos de Jehová en un pueblo de Georgia (el país), sujeta a un sutil machismo doméstico y a otro más explícito social y religioso, con la culpa y el castigo como insumos esenciales de dominación, todo esto inserto a su vez en un entorno nacional absolutamente hostil.

La crisis existencial de Yana, acelerada por una inesperada serie de agresiones, es abordada de manera radical por la directora, con algunos recursos formales llevados al extremo, en una suerte de tragedia bíblica que va de la poesía a la violencia simbólica o verbal a la física.

English Review

Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) is the wife of the leader of a community of Jehovah's Witnesses in a town in Georgia (the country), where the majority of the population profess the Orthodox Christian faith and sees them with bad eyes. Her community task is to teach classes in preparation for baptism to the children of the congregation. A serious incident in the community meeting room (superbly filmed) determines the departure of her husband for a few days and she is left alone with her son. The unexpected aggressions that she suffers during that absence are added to the buried crisis that she had been going through.

Beginning is the debut feature by the young director Dea Kulumbegashvili that won no less than four major prizes at the 2020 San Sebastian Festival (film, direction, script and leading actress) from the president of the jury Luca Guadagnino and it was selected to represent its country for the Oscars.

How to approach the review of this original and radical film in so many ways?

From the formal point of view, the director virtuously resorts to extremely long fixed shots (that is, shots without cuts where the camera does not move), both for intimate scenes with a hypnotic stillness and for others that do not allow the viewer to escape from a painting of violence. Even more remarkable is the original use of sound out of the field (that is, keeping certain events or characters in a scene out of the picture), with literally disturbing effects. A beautiful photograph is added and an almost total absence of a soundtrack.

Yana is a woman who abandoned her vocation as an actress to follow and accompany her husband. In other words, she chooses to belong to a community where she dominates a subtle domestic and another more explicit social and religious male chovinism, with guilt and punishment as essential inputs for domination. A community in turn inserted into an absolutely hostile national and religious environment.

Yana is a dissatisfied woman who, on the one hand, does not finish assuming her role as a victim, despite the siege of aggressions that is rising around her, but who at the same time is incubating some way to overcome it in those long dead times that her we see transit.

Beginning supports more than one reading. It can be seen as a kind of biblical tragedy that refers in part to the cinema of Dumont and that of Lars Von Trier, where some character perhaps fulfills an allegorical role not because of the obviousness of the script but because of the codes that subdue the protagonist and determine the look her.

Reseña Español 

Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) es la esposa del líder de una comunidad de Testigos de Jehová en un pueblo de Georgia (el país), donde la mayoría de la población profesa la fe cristiana ortodoxa y los ve con malos ojos. Su tarea comunitaria es impartir clases preparatorias para el bautismo a los niños de la congregación. Un grave incidente en la sala de reuniones de la comunidad (magníficamente filmado) determina la partida de su esposo durante unos días y que ella quede sola con su hijo. Las inesperadas agresiones que padece durante esa ausencia se suman a la soterrada crisis que venía transitando.

Beginning es la ópera prima de la joven directora Dea Kulumbegashvili que ganó nada menos que cuatro premios mayores del Festival de San Sebastián 2020 (película, dirección, guion y actriz protagónica) de manos del presidente del jurado Luca Guadagnino y fue seleccionada para representar a su país para los premios Oscar.

¿Cómo abordar la reseña de esta película original y radical en tantos sentidos?

Desde lo formal, la directora recurre virtuosamente a larguísimos planos fijos (es decir, tomas sin cortes donde la cámara no se mueve), tanto para las escenas intimistas y de una quietud hipnótica como para otras que no permiten escapar al espectador de un cuadro de violencia. Más notable aún es el original uso del sonido fuera de campo (es decir manteniendo en una escena fuera de la imagen ciertos sucesos o personajes), con efectos literalmente inquietantes. Se suma una bella fotografía y una ausencia casi total de banda sonora.

Yana es una mujer que abandonó su vocación de actriz para seguir y acompañar a su esposo. Es decir, que opta por pertenecer a una comunidad donde domina un machismo doméstico (a veces sutil) y explícito social y religioso, con la culpa y el castigo como insumos esenciales de dominación. Una comunidad inserta a su vez en un entorno nacional y religioso absolutamente hostil.

Yana es una mujer insatisfecha que por un lado no termina de asumir su rol de víctima, a pesar del cerco de agresiones que se va levantando alrededor de ella, pero que al mismo tiempo va incubando alguna manera de superarlo en esos largos tiempos muertos que la vemos transitar.

Beginning admite más de una lectura. Puede verse como una suerte de tragedia bíblica que remite en parte al cine de Dumont y al de Lars Von Trier, donde algún personaje cumple acaso un rol alegórico no por una obviedad del guion sino por los códigos que sojuzgan a la protagonista y condicionan su mirada.",1
895,What an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!,1
896,The Outside Story is a great slice of life movie that is reminiscent to classic 80's/90's films. It captured the essence of a guy evolving from the opening image (Social hermit dealing with heartbreak) to the ending (Fighting for his ex and allowing himself to be open to making friendships with his neighbors). I resonated heavy with a lot of the themes. Brian Tyree Henry really excelled in his first leading role. I love how the city of New York was a character on it own.,1
897,"Such a funny, heartfelt film. From the directing to the performances to the writing -- I absolutely loved it. A beautiful New York story!",1
898,"I loved The Outside Story. Incredibly well written in terms of both story and dialog, such beautifully thought out shots, terrific directing/acting. Bryan Tyree Hill was fantastic and perfectly cast. Also very much loved Hannah Bos and the great performance by the young Olivia Edward. The scoring was TIGHT and perfect. It was well-crafted and executed in every detail. I both laughed out loud and teared up.  I really really loved it.",1
899,"A powerhouse performance by Brian Tyree Henry lifts an already good film to elite heights.  A free flowing, never too serious looks at something that could happen to just about anyone.  It's a near miracle that write and director Casimir Nozkowski got 85 minutes out of this concept, but it doesn't feel stretched at all.  I wanted more of the characters and i want a lot more of Sunita Mani who is great in everything.  She has a fantastic chemistry with Henry which is the highlight of the movie.  There are reasons we don't know our neighbors, but they can often be helpful may not be something you get in a fortune cookie, however, it's what we have here!  Delightful! Final Score: 8.8/10",1
900,"I enjoyed the low stakes energy of the film. There aren't many films that are optimistic and life-affirming these days, especially in the indie sphere, and I appreciated that a bunch.",1
901,"Brian Tyree Henry was great, so it gets an extra star for that. 
This movie ... had already aged poorly before it even came out which yikes. And the plotline where his preteen neighbor has an abusive mom is just ... dropped in there and then never resolved in any way?",0
902,"Brian Tyree Henry is great as always. There aren't many films that are optimistic and life-affirming these days, and I appreciated that a bunch. I think it will connect with a ton of people who wanna get outside after the pandemic. I live in Brooklyn and enjoyed this slice of life piece of my city!",1
903,"A perfectly entertaining and poignant movie. the storytelling is very nuanced and Brian Tyree Henry shines. Love that it touches on thing I really relate to without a heavy hand, but with a knowing sense of humor and compassion. A+",1
904,"I think spending a year cooped up at home, everyone can relate to this funny and poignant film.  Great cast and clever screenplay.",1
905,"Loved it! A sweet, feel-good movie about connection: love, friends, community. The performances are warm, the colors are bright, and it's funny too. Super charming. A beautiful hour and a half. 
I watched it with my kids, too: 9yo and 12 yo. There was a single, short uncomfortable moment (just a casual conversation while leaning against a sex contraption lol). Overall, the humor that can be enjoyed by all.",1
906,"Don't let the cover art mislead you. This is an intense look at conflict between races, but also within a young girl as she tries to find her place in a world of violence. Watch it with your kids, knowing there is a lot of profanity, but also much worth talking about with children facing the problems of today. Excellent!",1
907,"Naïve and biased to fit the narrative to illicit a sympathetic reaction. It is not historically accurate and omits to mention the blockades were set up by the ""warriors"" and supporters. 
The army being called in is proof of the threat that the militants posed to the surrounding populations of both Oka and Chateauguay.",0
908,I really wanted to like this because of the perspective and moment in history it portrays... but the acting and writing was pretty awful.,0
909,The true story about the standoff between Mohawk communities & the Quebec government forces is on the point with great cinematography & pace,1
910,"This was an excellent movie, that featured strong performances by both the adult, and child actors. I had no idea about this incident. I guess USA tv coverage was non-existent. It made me cry. Wonderful film. Loved it! ❤",1
911,"'Beans' is a well-made film in pretty much all facets of filmmaking. The direction and writing by Tracey Deer (& co-screenwriter Meredith Vuchnich) is assured and skillful. This allows for the ideas of privilege vs. cultural and familial preservation, racism, and especially that of moving from the safe harbor of childhood to the mania of adolescence to all stand out with a clear point to all.
The acting by the major players is uniformly strong. Pamela Dickerson stands out as a loving mother desperate to keep her family safe and sound. The young actors give authentic performances, and Deer gives us realistic kids, smart but with all the brashness, false bravado and frailties we all have at such ages. 
But lead actress Kiawentiio and Paulina Alexis are both fantastic. Alexis is my favorite actor on the wonderful 'Reservation Dogs', and she is again so real and believable as April; a tough girl always putting up a front to maintain her position among her friends and keep herself from losing it in the face of abuse. Kiawenttio as Beans gives an award-worthy performance that is equally authentic and nuanced.
The use of actual footage from the 78-day standoff brings home to reality of what those of this town felt on all sides; the pride and fear of a still-disenfranchised minority; the frustration and outpouring of racist hate from the non-Mohawk population; the impotence of law and politicians to find a resolution sooner. 3.8 stars",1
912,"The film tells a story that needs to be put out there, but it does so in such a sloppy way it takes away from the gravity of the 1990 Oka Crisis at Kanesatake in Quebec Canada.  Just about everything about this film is not up to par.  Tracey Deer, who co-wrote and directed was a witness to the situation, and means well, but the film is written like a bad after school special or a 80s Made for Cable Movie.  The news footage made me wish this was a documentary and not a feature-length drama.  Final Score: 5/10",0
913,Beans is not afraid to show the complete brutality that can come from outright racism  that leads to a more peaceful resolution.,1
914,"Heartfelt and pretty interesting on the social commentary about native americans, soil and frontier. But unfortunately this aspect is sidelined by a pretty conventional coming of age stroy hitting all the usual beats. Apart from that the actors are great and it's a nice insight on fighting for your convictions and standing for what is important.",1
915,Amazing writing and acting especially by the young woman playing Beans.,1
916,"Pretty awesome installment, lots of creative gruesome ideas.",1
917,"Definitely more high quality than the previous installment, ""Viral"". Actual effort went into this film and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. Every story was enjoyable.",1
918,Started off a bit rough but as you watch you see its made of lots of short horrors. The last 2 / robot Doctor and vampire really got me. There's a little bit of comedy in it too that didn't stick with me but tbh I'd watch a whole movie of that robot Doctor one.,1
919,"Excellent horror anthology, much better than other VHS's including the new ‘99. Highly recommended!",1
920,"This was THE worst movie I've ever seen. The stories were boring, shallow, and only got worse as time went on. The acting was the worst I've ever seen. I honestly have nothing good to say about it. This is the first time in a long time that I genuinely hated a movie and wished for it to be over. It has no redeeming qualities.",0
921,"The first tapes are insane!!!

Just that tape with Dieselpunk style, this is disappointing",0
922,"Wasn't a big fan of this one, the last part I didn't enjoy and the ending felt cheesy. The best part of the film was definitely the two middle scenes since they had me at the edge of my seat, but half of the movie felt boring and wasted.",0
923,"Not the biggest fan of the VHS movies, or found footage in general. However a few of these short anthology scenes were really good and effective. In fact the first 3 were great. Unfortunately the last and final short didn't do it for me, as well as the book end story of the film. The way i see it is I liked 3/5 short films, so a 3 out of 5 rating makes sense to me.",0
924,"5 Stars for the mad-scientist-anime-come-to-life segment, highly entertaining!",1
925,Storyline was horrible. Graphics were worse than a horror game. One of those movies where you keep clicking to see how much time is left. Don't recommend,0
926,Great early footage of Mr. Ailey - juxtaposed with a contemporary work in progress. Interviews with those who worked with and knew him were inspiring.,1
927,"Good blend of performances recorded when the ballets were developed, and interviews with people who were part of his compny, and interviews that he did. It reflects Aileys lifetime (segregation, poverty, the AIDS epidemic).",1
928,this is a Moving and Timeless doc,1
929,Delightful and heartbreaking… he was wonderful and is truly missed.,1
930,Real clips from newsreels and those amazing performances.  Unvarnished information about his challenges and illness.,1
931,There could have been more about how he learned to dance and where.,1
932,Great film. I do wish they could have gone into greater detail about how Ailey came to create some of greatest works.,1
933,"I don’t want to give anything away.  As The Dry unfolds, it becomes more and more outstanding.  A must see!",1
934,"Visually stunning film that introduces you to complex and unique- almost bizarre- characters. The story deftly melds an small-town mystery that has a folklore-feel with a fresh gruesome murder. Thought the score was great and really elevated the ending scenes. Also, can never go wrong with Eric Bana. There was one minor plot point at the end that didn't make sense to me, but that is probably because the film is adapted from a book. Still, a great film.",1
935,We’ll acted and interesting,1
936,Great plot!  Great way to celebrate being able to go to the movies again!,1
937,Powerful story. Impressive acting.,1
938,It was a great movie! Well written.,1
939,"A very simple story that has plenty of twists that'll keep you entertained. Certain twists worked, certain ones didn't. Eric Bana was good though. Not as gritty as the recent string of Australian thrillers.",0
940,"Excellent film. What starts as a simple murder-suicide becomes a taught, enticing and atmospheric thriller that peels back the layers of deceit and pain at the centre of a small town on the brink of collapse.  Extremely well acted by a fantastic cast.  Highly recommended to be viewed on a large screen to allow oneself to be belittled by the bleak drought in Australia.",1
941,very authentic Australian country and drought .  Could picture the actors as people I have known. Great adaptation of the book.,1
942,"Great story and excellent subtle acting. no sex the only minimal sex and violence were in context, not the formula sex and violence you usually see in Movies today.  It is wonderful to get back to the Movies again",1
943,"I like the premise, but it is never the least bit creepy.",0
944,"Strong debut from director Keith Thomas who uses Jewish folklore, faith & personal grief to make a generally creepy film. The lack of light & the sound helps to build a number of tense moments.",1
945,"The first half of the movie really starts out strong, lots of tension, creepy visuals, the works. Unfortunately, during the last 30 minutes of the movie, it kinda falls apart; the quality of practical and special effects drops dramatically (seriously, ""hands reaching out behind sheets for 5 minutes"" is the sort of thing you expect to see in a theme park dark ride, not a movie), and the finale is downright corny by comparison to the setup.",0
946,"Low budget movie, first have is good and creepy but the 2nd half loses its touch. It's not as scary during the second half, first half is creepy and somewhat scary. They could've took this movie in a different direction and made it a lot better than it is. It had a lot of potential. Overall I guess it's a decent horror movie compared to the plethora of bad horror movies out there.",0
947,"After sorting through all of the schlock horror on hulu, even watching the insufferably predictable ""Run""(which was the best of the terrible fare I'd seen up to that point), I came across this incredible gem.  Reminiscent of Veronica, this film really pulls off a slow start without forcing dialogue, and delivers with supernatural terror of folklore. Even though the support group at the beginning plays little role at the beginning, it doesn't feel pointless. I love this movie. At no point did I want to skip ahead. The plot was compelling. The only downside is the soundtrack, which lets you know when you should be scared before the scare even starts. A little A24 in that respect. But other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.",1
948,"Minimalist horror movie with big brains and a powerful message. Beautifully written, beautifully shot and the Jewish motifs were fascinating.",1
949,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS! Keith Thomas. I'm saving his name for NEVER seeing something made by this man again! The ""Firestarter"" remake this year was already atrocious, and ""The Vigil"" (his debut film in 2019) is not far behind in terms of badness. Dave Davis, Menashe Lustig and Lynn Cohen (RIP) are decent characters and the story was promising, but everything is ruined by the man whose name started this review. Thomas seems to force a horror atmosphere here (he seems to have no notion of how to build a horror ambience), the soundtrack is too aggressive, there's a scene when the protagonist is feeling his bones breaking that is almost completely dark, and the scene where he confronts the evil entity is one of the worst I've ever seen. Are you really expecting to burn someone's face using a candle and 15cm far from its face? That's why the movie industry uses visual effects, to avoid embarrassments like this. The film was already boring, with almost nothing happening (and the resource of cellphone screen items appearing on the scene doesn't work outside teenage/rom-com films), and this finale makes a point of being a rotten cherry on a burned cake. And yes, I strongly believe that the PG-13 rating has compromised this project a lot. I mean, why a movie with this thematic would be PG-13? It doesn't make sense, at least in my mind.",0
950,Empiezo a pensar que Keith Thomas es un cobarde.,0
951,"The ritual could've been creepy and haunting; the burned out Jew sitting vigil with a dead man overnight and encountering an evil spirit. But carrot fingers (the demon) came in a little too late, and seemed to be too easy to handle.",0
952,"Wow I absolutely love this film. Solid camera work, great acting and most of all…it's genuinely creepy",1
953,"While I wasn't a huge fan of Tangerine, Sean Baker's subsequent movies (Red Rocket and Florida Project) have been nothing short of fantastic. This is a filthy movie in basically all senses of the term and within that lies a lot of its simple charms and its deeper themes. Witnessing Mikey's self interest deteriorate everything and everyone around him is a slow motion explosion that you know is coming the entire movie, but it's so destructive it's impossible to look away. Simon Rex, star of such films as SCARY MOVIE V, gives an unlikely outstanding performance and embodies his role unbelievably well.",1
954,I really liked this movie.  Mickey started out being so likeable and over time you realize he is an overgrown drifter.,1
955,If you have a good sense of humor you'll love this movie. Proof that not every good movie has to have an all star lineup with a 500 million dollar budget.,1
956,Glad too see a dude get his dues and make it the top. I hope he gets too do alot of great movies. This movie is not for everyone it is what is. Better not too read reviews and jusg watch it and let it infect you with its power of cinema that might touch you in  strange places.,1
957,"Such a great Indie, I loved 'The Florida Project' and 'Tangerine' so I was def gonna check this one out. Sean Baker is one hell of a director, an American Indie force to be reckoned with.
Watch this film folks it's an absolute gem, my fav of the 3 which is saying something.",1
958,"A good story about a typical american porn actor. The consequences and lifestyle are well described. The end could have been different, he would have left silently and everything would have been fine.",1
959,"Wonderfully acted (particularly the characters of Mikey and Strawberry), beautifully shot, great dialogue - in a painfully realistic and upsettingly pointless story. Not an enjoyable watch by any means, but technically well crafted.

Side note: ""Strawberry""'s singing voice is incredible!",0
960,"Insufferable. I was misled by the great reviews by critics. Did we watch the same movie? The characters were a bunch of depressing, unlikable stereotypes lacking in any kind of depth or complexity. Felt like the writers and directors just wanted an excuse to make a movie about a disgusting has been exploiting a child. And make it a comedy that's not even funny. Just sad and disturbing.",0
961,"Although well-made and creatively done, the central focus of Red Rocket was too disturbing for me to enjoy. Whether Sean Baker attempted to tell this story through an empathetic lens or a less condoning one is irrelevant. The emphasis on the extremely predatory relationship between 40yo Mikey Saber and a 17 year old girl is cringe-worthy, highly glorified, and absurdly inappropriate.  I may be in the minority, but this film was hard to watch and the entire meaning flew right over my head. And I'm okay with that. I just wasn't okay with this.",0
962,Really well done.  Great performances all around.,1
963,There is some past history to the story line.,1
964,"Although it was a little slow (but was more true to the way people behaved in the time period) it was mesmerizing.  The performances were nuanced and incredible.  Underlying all of this was the difficulty being a black person in America. You would have thought things would have changed by now, maybe  in NY, but the more rural towns in this country tell a different story.  It was great to see a really good story poignantly told without all the blood, guts, sex,  gore, cursing and superheroes that dominate the movies today.",1
965,Great movie worth seeing,1
966,It was good!!! The choice of choosing to pass as life or black as death was so intriguing. The cinematography was excellent.,1
967,Sensitive & beautifully filmed. Acting was superb.,1
968,Plot and acting are excellent. Movie evolves in unexpected ways.,1
969,Filming in Black & White was beautiful.,1
970,Great story & acting,1
971,"There must have been a lot of footage on the cutting floor. This was choppy, and you asked too many questions at the end. Not about ""King Richard"", but about all of the other family members. And who were his advisors for financial and legal matters? Did he get insights from newsstand magazines about writing contracts? Lastly, there really aren't any poignant moments that Will Smith carried. I think he comes across as a bully.",0
972,"Superbly Done, Very Moving an inspiration for Everyone see!",1
973,Great story and acting,1
974,A wonderful performance by Will Smith - for me the best I've seen from him to date.  This was one of the few times (with the possible exception of Pursuit of Happyness?) that I felt I was watching a character study and not the incorporation of a storyline into the typically smart and witty Will Smith persona.  Aunjanue Ellis was also amazing as Brandi Williams.  Playing real people (especially those who are still alive) presents unique challenges.  All the cast did an outstanding job and made this an exceptional film.,1
975,"Movie is Inspirational.
I hope more go and see this movie.
This is a Must-See movie!
I enjoyed this movie from Start to Finish!",1
976,"OUTSTANDING MOVIE!!!! NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. THANK YOU!!!!!",1
977,"felt like an honest account of the uphill climb to get the girls into mainstream pro tennis.  Will Smith gave admirable performance as dad, manager, coach, and dictator.  felt myself wanting to yell at him during the movie.  just before the end credits, the girls' accomplishments are listed, making it all seem worth it.  great cast, great production sites, great story.",1
978,Very interesting story. Loved the actors,1
979,All performances were excellent! Interesting story. Had trouble hearing dialogue at times.,1
980,a return-to-form from PTA,1
981,"Iit was adorable, the best flick I have seen in a while!",1
982,"Uplifting and nostalgic, loved the escape",1
983,"An eclectic, frequently cringe worthy romance that we loved.  Look for those cameo roles from the big stars and see how much fun/ creepy they are.",1
984,"It was a fun and wild ride. But the plot was haphazard. This story is more in the vein of Inherent Vice, than his other movies. As a viewer one benefits from enjoying the ride rather than expecting it to flow. It was a fun story and the acting was great. It's just not a PT Anderson masterpiece.",1
985,"The movie was somewhat entertaining, but so unrealistic and disjointed.  (LIcorice Pizza)  The acting was good, but not great.",0
986,Beautifully shot and acted. Very much in keeping with Anderson's style as there is not a straight forward plot really a series of sequences that rang true for me. I really liked this film.,1
987,Oh my God you need to watch this movie it is so good. You are going to leave the theater smiling trust me,1
988,"It is a run-of-the-mill rom-com, with the obligatory few scenes of the absurd to leaven what is a otherwise a fully predictable storyline.  It runs 20 minutes too long and has no business being among this years best-picture nominees, which made it a big disappointment.  The portrayal of Southern California in the early 1970s has been done many times before.  That said, the leads gave fine performances.",0
989,Somewhat entertaining. No motive for characters' actions. Boring in places.,0
990,"this was a fun ride from start to finish. 

production value was great 

felt like a comic book exploded in my face 

overall good comedy moments and the action was great tons of gore. 

go watch this.",1
991,"Death and destruction become a beautiful thing to watch in this movie. Action storytelling that seamlessly breathes in comedy and drama, with some of the most interesting and definitely most colorful characters in a superhero film.",1
992,I actually enjoyed the movie. It was one of the greatest movies Ive seen since James Gunn is a good movie director.,1
993,Finally DC stepping up to right direction. This IS the Suicide Squad.,1
994,"I liked this movie a lot.  Tons of fun and the character interactions were great.  HBO did a disservice to this movie, placing it on HBOMax.  Bring back Boomy!!!",1
995,what a masterpiece 🙌,1
996,"Fantastic cast that are properly developed unlike the previous iteration of this franchise. incredibly funny and violent with the James Gunn charm people have grown to love from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. it's ridiculous, bloody, funny, heartwarming and an all around good time. Hopefully DC can ride the momentum of taking the obscure characters in their comics and making them likeable since it seems to be working.",1
997,What a train wreck!! Go see anything else.,0
998,we all know this is the best movie ever. James Gunn to the rescue of wb.,1
999,It wasn’t as good as I anticipated. The only good character was Harley Quinn.,0
1000,I normally don’t write reviews but I’ll make an exception for this one. Easily one of the best films I’ve ever seen. Phenomenal.,1
1001,Plot twist after plot twist. An alternative title could be “ A Powerful Young Woman”.,1
1002,Great movie. Really thought Carey Mulligan should’ve got the Oscar. I loved the subtlety of the details we know this event happened but they don’t show us the video etc. Love the funny edge too when he says he thinks her mom is hot..that’s Stifler’s mom!.. anyone else get this?! tasteful classy & well done.,1
1003,Loved the movie! Cary mulligan was fantastic..,1
1004,"Intriguing. Great plot development, twists, and all with a moral.",1
1005,It was a really good movie.,1
1006,Slow and all over the place. Was it a thriller? Romance? Ending was dumb. Disappointed.,0
1007,Second viewing. Even more amazing this time. Acting is stellar and the script is seriously clever and surprising.,1
1008,"This movie is a must see! It was funny, raw, thought-provoking, romantic, sad, and energizing. I loved it!",1
1009,Not another rape/revenge movie. Kept you very engaged and made you think twice about the topic.,1
1010,I really enjoyed this movie. I almost don't know why. But the premise of the movie and the very good acting held it all together. I would recommend for sure.,1
1011,"This movie has relatively good acting, the right atmosphere and the initial curious tension that makes for an interesting film - then it just gets boring and the lengthy monotonous dialogue drains you.  It is overly complicated for a very simple ""twist"" to the overlapping storyline - the producers created a build up that did not live up to the eventual conclusion.  If they just played out the actual dialogue rather than talked to it, the movie would've been over in 10 minutes.  The critics got this one terribly wrong - it does not deserve anything near 91%!",0
1012,"Excellent film, left you guessing until the end. We need more films of this caliber",1
1013,"You'll never guess the ending of this Canadian noir thriller, unless you cheat beforehand and read one of the several plot explanations available online. I strongly suggest that you not do that and just watch it.

On the other hand, after watching ""The Oak Room,"" I still needed an explanation. So I looked one up. It helped. But it wasn't cheating.

The deviously clever plot contains stories within stories, whose relationships are revealed like opening Chinese boxes nested within each other. A young man named Steve (R.J. Mitte) walks into a bar on a blustery cold winter night. The grizzled older bartender, Paul (Peter Outerbridge) is not happy to see him—not because it's closing time, but because Steve disappeared after his father's death, not even bothering to come to his funeral. And his father was a good friend of Paul's.

After some terse back-and forth conversation, Steve wants to tell Paul a story. It's about a man (Martin Roach) who walks into another bar on a blustery cold winter night, and the bartender (Ari Millen) is not happy to see him—not because it's closing time, but for a different reason which I will not reveal. The two men have a terse back-and forth conversation, and the bartender tells the man a story that's rather unnerving.

If you can't figure out where all of this is going, don't feel bad. I was lost throughout much of this film, but I felt that something was coming if I would just hang in there. I was right. And I was surprised.

The story can only be described in oblique terms; that's the way it's designed. The performances are very good. The camera work, which frequently focuses on small details and clues, is superb: an empty beer bottle. A wristwatch. And the ongoing blizzard that never seems to end.

The film burns slowly and will tax some viewers' patience. But those who stick with it will be rewarded (unpleasantly).

And if you felt no need to look up a plot explanation after watching this one, good for you. You're a more savvy viewer than I.",1

1015,"Its different, its well presented, its not as entertaining as it could be.  I usually love films like this that weave multiple stories into one culmination sequence, they do this successfully here they just don't build up enough tension along the way. The movie itself doesn't straight away suck in viewers - ok - I'm a more mature watcher I sometimes like a slower opening, however, it meanders rather than weaves over the first 25-30 minutes that are basically unproductive and not pivotal to the ultimate climax.",0

1020,"First off, this is a fine film. The amount of social and personal issues this movie touched on was immense but it didn't feel like it. Its when the movie is over you realize everything the film spoke to. The acting was divine, some of the best I've seen in a long time. Fair warning, this movie is slow and, at least to me, some reactions get lost in translation. Yet, once again, a Japanese film shows us the beauty of the people who are part of that culture. The imagery, both physical and emotional, are beautiful. This film can show us a beauty when anger and self-pity are not a part of life and how lovely society is when it's people truly have respect for each other.",1
1021,"The protagonist is obdurate with his decision to pursue love no matter the cost. He was castigated by friends, family, and society for the choice he made.

1024,"Never uninteresting, but not deep, this film missed a great chance to pick a lane and instead took the middle of the road.  The narrative either has to be the struggle for the girl, or the law angle which develops.  Melding that and the artist's sudden change of mood and it's hard to wonder what this could have been.  Layered with fine performances it's generally polite to look at except for one out of place scene.  Take it or leave it for sure!  6/10",0
1025,"How to tell a story that deals with a work of art that uses the skin of a human being as a canvas? Well director Kaouther Ben Hania found a formula to tell this story that sounds quite bizarre at first if it wasn't partially based on the real story of the Belgian artist Wim Delvoye who did it.
In the script for this film as well as to add to the dramatic value of the story we meet two lovers in Syria in 2011 - just before the war. Raqqa Sam Ali (played by the excellent Yahya Mahayni) and his fiancée Abeer (the beautiful actress Dea Lianne) who are madly in love until an incident separates them forcing Sam Ali to flee to Lebanon in order to escape prison in Syria.
Time passes and Sam Ali begins to adapt to life in Beirut but keeping in touch with Abeer, who is favored by his family and the political situation in Syria getting worse, marries a man with a lot of money who takes her to Brussels, Belgium.
Poor and without much hope of finding his love again Sam Ali attends some clandestine art events in Beirut because as a refugee he cannot be identified with the penalty of being deported. And in an artist presentation he meets two people who will completely change his life the internationally known artist Jeffrey Godefroi (the equally excellent Koen De Bouw) and Soraya Waldy (Monica Bellucci in an interesting appearance) as an art dealer. In this meeting, Jeff proposes to Sam Ali that he is able to free him from the limits imposed by the refugee situation in which he lives with wide freedoms and can even travel to Belgium and meet his lover Abeer.
The price will be a contract in which Sam Ali grants his back being tattooed with a work of art by Jeffrey as well as being available to him when necessary to display it in the art gallery. Reluctant Sam Ali eventually accepts and that life-changing choice is what the movie is about.
With some amazing and provocative scenes we discreetly experience the sensation that the director manages to subtly place us inside Sam Ali's life.
I don't recall feeling such an effect in recent times with such delicacy that we clearly understand the benefits Sam Ali comes to experience as well as his deepest afflictions. This is all without ever falling into the obvious or empty.
In one of the many interesting scenes in this movie is an auction of artwork at which Sam Ali is eventually sold. The intensity and temperature raise so much at this particular moment that if you're not enjoying this movie too much you'll change your mind on this mesmerizing scene.
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best International Feature Film 2020. This film surprised me because everything I expected didn't happen and it was positively surprising and I congratulate director Ben Hania for exceeding my expectations. Well done.",1

1027,"Despite its weaknesses, it still carries its weight as an art film",1
1028,As the reviewers have written this movie is collaboration of money and art.  However the art is a tattoo on the back of a Syrian refugee.  As serious as the subject of abused refugees is there are some very human and some very funny aspect of a living man whose back becomes an exhibited work of art and is even sold to a collector and then auctioned! In all this story is a love story and seems to never find happiness.,1
1029,"The Man Who Sold His Skin is a film that had a great premise, but not a particularly good execution. In ideas and themes, it's very strong. The central acting performance is excellent as is the film's cinematography. But the second half dragged, it became rather repetitious and ultimately it would have been much better as a short rather than a feature movie.",1
1030,"This film, which was Syria's entry to the Oscars and made the shortlist, centers on Sam Ali, a refugee who agrees to have his back tattooed as a form of art in exchange for money, freedom, and a visa to Europe, where his girlfriend is betrothed to a member of the embassy. While uneven in its execution, the film works best as a commentary (and perhaps even satire) on the question of art and its commodification (as well as the commodification of Sam). Sam exchanges his back for his freedom, but he comes to realize that he is trapped in a different kind of hell. It is one of those films that I enjoy, one that stimulates thinking and challenges convention. The cinematography is beautifully done and is itself, in many places, a work of art. I also really liked the score. Thumbs up for a thought-provoking film that is well-acted and kept me engaged. I liked this one as well as some of the others on the Best International Feature list.",1

1042,"WIld Indian is an interesting film, although I think an incomplete one. It has a very interesting premise but I felt lacked somewhat in execution. The film is set in two time periods. Firstly in Wisconsin in 1988 with two teenage Native American boys, Makwa and Teddo. Makwa is bullied at home and school and when a situation develops into tragedy they have to make life changing decisions. Most of the film is set in the present day as the we follow the boys that are now grown men. They have gone in different directions to how you might have expected and they now have to deal with actions from the past. The film is an interesting one but I felt it was overwritten and acted in parts and felt stilted at times. Potentially a good film but one that didn't quite deliver.",1
1043,"If there ever was a film that made me crave for more than I got...it's this one.  ""Wild Indian"" is about Michael, a Native American who left his reservation years ago.  He also leaves the knowledge that he helped cover up a murder years earlier.  Time catches up, however, as the actual killer is released from prison.  Michael takes matters into his own hands to keep the secret.  I feel like this story needed a more fleshed out resolution.  Maybe a longer movie would have brought the needed depth.  Some good performances, but I wanted more.",0
1044,"As thrillers go, this slowburning tale of a pair of adolescent Native American cousins from troubled backgrounds who get caught up in a dangerous situation has its moments at the film's outset but it drops the ball when their adult selves eventually seek to come to grips with their past. Given the picture's thoroughly unlikeable protagonist, needlessly slow pacing, inexplicable plot developments and soliloquies containing observations that seem to lose something in translation, this alleged mystery/crime saga never quite comes together in an engaging or satisfying way. The fine supporting performances of Chaske Spencer and Phoenix Wilson help to prop up this offering, but the stilted portrayal of Michael Greeneyes and the wasted casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Kate Bosworth present a decidedly mixed bag on the acting front. Director Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr.'s debut feature could use some definite spit and polish on a variety of fronts, especially in light of its overall attempts at saying something meaningful but not really saying much of anything at all. Indeed, how this one managed to garner four Independent Spirit Award nominations is perhaps the film's biggest mystery of all.",0
1045,"Interesting premise, but some parts of the story dragged along.",0
1046,"An ambitious , but ultimately frustrating debut from Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr., 'Wild Indian' had big promise before a third act left turn derailed its momentum.  This is such a good premise that the fact Corbine Jr. couldn't stick the landing may not bother everyone as it did me.  There are so many elements that work, but in the end I'm curious what the extended cut looks like.  At only 90 minutes, there should have been more meat on the bone.  Native Americans are underrepresented in Hollywood and it's too bad.  Fantastic performance from Michael Greyeyes, who we need to see more of.  If you're tuning in for Jesse Eisenberg, don't bother.  He has nothing to do and is in only a few quick scenes.  You have to wonder how much of his work ended up on the cutting room floor.  Final Score: 5/10",0
1047,"A Indian teenager while walking in the woods with a friend hunting  shoots and kills a third teenager in a daydream moment. The friend assists the shooter in covering up the murder. The shooter leaves the reservation and makes a success of himself. His friend deals with his guilt by going in and out of prison for 25 years. Eventually he follows (his friend) the shooter to California and tries to kill him with a pistol to appease his own guilt. The bullet only grazes his friends arm.
He has a change of heart and puts the gun down
giving the intended victim the chance to pick up the gun and promptly shoot his previously threatening friend dead. He is acquitted and then travels to the beach where centuries earlier an ancestor also healed himself.

The filmography , editing and acting are fine.
Who cares?  The story is about nothing.
At least a Seinfeld rerun might make you laugh.
This on the other hand really is nothing.",0
1048,"Rating: B-

""Wild Indian is a strong feature directorial debut from Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr., who I recommend following closely for the next few years. Boasting a compelling narrative, Michael Greyeyes and Chaske Spencer take the viewers through a dark, emotional journey of understanding that life isn't always fair and that making amends only works for people who can actually feel guilt or remorse. Both actors offer notable performances, but it's Spencer who really impacts me at an emotional level, elevating the only character I truly cared about. On the other hand, the protagonist is an incredibly unlikeable person who tries his hardest to forget the tragic past through deplorable actions. Jesse Eisenberg sadly sticks out like a sore thumb. The short runtime partially compensates for the slow pacing, but overall I still had a good time.""",0
1049,Garbage. 90 minutes of solid movie only to end it with nothing. Garbage,0
1050,"Michael Greyeyes is a real standout here as a trouble disturbed psychopath dealing with issues from the past in his needy new life. Its wonderfully directed, but also dwells into the philosophical with its themes and a culture we should know more about.",1
1051,"This film has quite a dreamy feel to it, with some quite surreal situations taking place and also primarily due to the instrumental/classical style music featured. Some scenes appear like short flashbacks - 'blasts from the past' I suppose. The fact it dates from 2020 and is about a fast spreading virus is certainly ironic - characters wearing facemasks and the like and the fear of what the virus may cause are things we certainly can relate to.

It'd be hard not to feel sorry for the main female character, Emma, who is painfully aware of the impact this mysterious virus is having on her relationship with Jude. There are some poignant moments and I thought the script was quite good too - Emma makes some important points and raises interesting questions, even if she's only asking them rhetorically to herself (in some scenes she's her own narrator). It's about memory and identity.

It must be quite a proverbial roller coaster to go through what her character goes through. I thought this was an effective and atmospheric film, one I'd recommend, yes.",1

1055,"The idea behind this movie had a lot of potential, but it was squandered by the filmmakers. Far too little happens, so it's quite boring. It doesn't help that the actors, including the lead actress who does the voiceover, tend to mumble and slur their words. It also doesn't help that one particularly crucial scene (I'll leave out the details so as not to spoil it for anyone, but, if you watch it, you will know which one I mean) is completely unbelievable.",0

I love it so much I decided to write my first review. 
It's simply perfect. The direction, story, screenplay, cinematography, acting, cast, etc. are all top-notch. The soul-stirring music / score by Keegan DeWitt is a highlight for me personally. 
Great chemistry between the two leads. 
It's highly emotional throughout and I recommend having tissues on hand. 
It's sweet and heartbreaking in equal measure. 
While it's loved by most who have seen it (critics and audiences alike), I believe this film hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves. I'm so glad I stumbled across this gem.
Please watch it. You won't regret it.",1
1058,"In a world that's been rocked with an unexplainable disease that leaves its victims with deteriorating memory loss, Little Fish is a thinly veiled look at the ravages of both Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The film focuses on couple Emma and Jude as Jude is stricken with this degenerative disease. The timing of this movie is not lost on viewers; as we continue to battle COVID-19, there's thematic parallels of a disease that attacks the mind rather than the body. As the world becomes increasingly desperate for a cure, we see how the disease affects first the couple's friends and eventually the couple themselves. In stark contrast from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, another sci-fi film that deals with couples and the loss of memories, the power of memory is seen in a positive light, highlighting the strong bond between Emma and June and their journey of their relationship.

Olivia Cooke is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch. After turning in solid performances in both Sound of Metal and Pixie, she continues her hot streak here. As the events of Little Fish are seen through Emma's eyes, Cooke is our way into this world as we watch her struggle with the inevitability of her husband's mental demise. Anger, fear, and frustration all play key parts, intertwined with the excitement of starting a new relationship thanks to the film's editing. Jack O'Connell also turns in a convincing role as Jude's slow and steady descent into forgetfulness is intercut with his charm and likeability during the flashbacks. Unfortunately he's not as captivating as Cooke, who deals with the emotional burden of handling the decline. Still, O'Connell gives us enough to root for Jude as he fights to remember the details of his relationship with Emma.

Chad Hartigan's direction of Little Fish is right down the middle; there's nothing ostentation nor is there anything that's cringeworthy. The magic of the film lies in its editing, telling two simultaneous stories of the rise and fall of Emma and Jude as Emma narrates her thoughts to the audience. The intercutting between the two stories flows naturally and is used cleverly to obfuscate details, set up future uncertainty, and hide reveals. Mattson Tomlin, who wrote last year's Project Power and is an uncredited writer for Matt Reeves' The Batman, proves to be the weakest link in this project, as the story takes the safe route in dipping its toe in the vast pool that is exploring grief and mental decline. What starts as a promising concept falls a bit short in terms of its overall execution.

Overall, Little Fish is an emotionally engaging story about love and loss, even though it shies away from grief or the processing of grief. There's heavier elements that could've been mined from the concept that might've lead to a more weighty, fuller project, but as is the story is serviceable. Regardless, the characters and the performances of Cooke and O'Connell elevate this slightly from what could've been a pedestrian attempt to something a bit more substantial. The overt parallels to dementia are clear, but the story chooses to focus more on Emma's hope rather than Jude's decline. With a clever beginning and end that leaves the audience gut punched, Little Fish is worth a watch for the performances and chemistry between Cooke and O'Connell as they battle Jude's affliction in their own separate ways.",1
1059,"I was so sad the day I met ya… I can't remember why.

What if COVID doesn't kill you, but either slowly or instantly wiped your memory away?

Ahh, a beautiful tragedy, a tragic modern Romeo and Juliet. 

Probably one of the saddest movies this year, Little Fish told a couple trying to hold on to each other with feelings in a world where memories are getting eaten away. Logically, as a way to test memories, you ask another person about a memory or fact that both of you shared. The movie was a slow and painful descent to the inevitable. It's depressing to see such breathtaking and beautiful memories that the couple shared being crushed into nothingness by the harsh reality. 

As I said, I loved the scenes where the couple talked about how they got together. The little fish scene was definitely the best. It's creative and unique to the couple. However, the most beautiful part was also the most cruel part. Also, the ending just made all the depression before worse. 

Overall, a beautiful juxtaposition of joy and sadness. 9/10",1
1060,"Intimately shot and with sensitive performances (Olivia Cooke in particular is, once again, phenomenal), ‘Little Fish' is a personal-feeling story about love and loss, bittersweet with a heavy melancholic tone and appropriately blue visuals. It's an exploration of identity, memories and the past, and what happens if you lose them – not just to you, but your loved ones. It's a wonderfully directed, moving little drama with an ending that somehow manages to be tragic and beautiful, but I'll tell you now, it's also a bit of a rough watch. It's a film that stuck with me for a few days.",1

1065,"Delicate, yet brutal, 'Moffie' is a fine piece of cinema in which I found myself desperately rooting for the characters to find happiness.  It's a South African coming of age war drama that cuts hard while showing apartheid in 1981.   The music here is captivating and adds to the power of what the film is able to accomplish.  This is a hidden gem, with a queer subtext that is very intense.  Final Score: 8.7/10",1

Bullying and mob mentality is used to push them to ever-increasing levels of aggression and apathy.

The acting is spectacular, the scenery beautiful, and the ending emotionally jarring. It left me wanting more!",1

1069,"RATING: A  Director: David Hermanus
Moffie is one hell of an hard watch and is definitely not what you'd expect from an war film ( for instance it doesn't have some big budget fighting scenes ). The lead really makes you feel for him and you'll really hate the sort of camp overseer, so he's great. Obviously it makes it more realistic that the film is bilingual and there's not that much of English dialogue. That the Filmmakers chose a 1.37:1 Aspect Ratio makes it sort of boxy ( for ""there's no escape ).",1
1070,"When a closeted gay South African teen (a ""moffie"" in local derogatory lingo) is conscripted into the military in 1981 to fight encroaching Angolan communists and to enforce the nation's existing apartheid laws, he's not sure how to handle himself. And, unfortunately, neither is director Oliver Hermanus when it comes to telling his story. The film's seemingly solid and ironic premise -- that of someone in a persecuted community having to enforce legally sanctioned discriminatory policies against members of other persecuted constituencies -- should have been enough in itself to drive the narrative of this offering. However, Hermanus frequently goes off point (and, in turn, off the rails) in examining other less engaging tangents, drawing attention away from what should have easily made this picture work best. Odd editing, an inconsistent use of flashbacks, a patchwork of incompatible camera techniques and an almost-corny soundtrack don't help matters, either. To the director's credit, he does a credible job of presenting the extremes of emotion that men are capable of, from horrifically barbaric to eminently sensitive and caring, in large part through homages to movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) and ""Brokeback Mountain"" (sans cowboys) (2005). But, these few strengths aside, ""Moffie"" is a major disappointment, and that's regrettable, as this BAFTA-nominated release was something I was truly looking forward to.",0

1072,"I guess I've been spoiled by the fast pace of American movies.  The first half of this movie was agonizingly slow.  For example it spends an inordinate amount of time watching the main character walk down the street.  By the standards of American movies just about nothing happens in the first half.  I started skipping ahead.
At length we see the meeting of the parents, the headmistress, and the teacher whose sex tape (with her husband) was  uploaded to the web and then seen by her students.  That whole scene is essentially a well done, entertaining lecture  in the form of questions and criticism from hypocritical parents and very articulate, knowledgeable answers from the teacher.  

Don't bother to watch this in hopes of seeing the sex tape.  In the American version, at least, you hear the audio, which is pretty hot, but the entire screen is covered by a colorful graphic with statements about censorship and sex, sometimes humorous.",0

1074,"An intriguing Romanian film analyzing social hypocrisy in a unique and thought provoking way.  Radu Jude has a lot to say and boy does he ever make a statement.  He's able to highlight the absurd in such a precise way.  A woman who downloaded porn because she knew it would be taken down so she could show it to others because it's so revolting, is so right where we are as a society.  It's raunchy at times and slow in others but never dull.  A satire that explores humanity, Jude is not only perceptive, but allows the viewer to observe just how ridiculous a culture we are in! The loudest voices win, no matter how wrong they are. Final Score: 7/10",1
1075,Sort of a shotgun approach to commentary (the movie uses its framing device to go after seemingly every issue in modern Romanian society) which often makes for some bold sequences even while it's a little overstuffed.,1
1076,"the sex scene at the beginning was entirely too long. the joke was clear within a few seconds, but it just kept going for over 3 minutes, just showing us a censored screen and some subtitles. after this, the film progresses to a lot of  entirely meaningless footage of romanian shop fronts, murals, alleyways, neighborhoods and apartment buildings. it's not exactly bad, but most of it appears to genuinely just be candid footage of people walking by, or just graffiti the camera crew found in the city, and as such most of that footage would be better placed in some kind of documentary or a walking livestream or something. by 30 minutes into the film, it's still basically the same, although the protagonist is beginning to find out that her tape has been leaked. it really feels like this movie should tell us first and foremost that it's essentially a long series of stock footage of romanian daily events, with just a few shots actually planned and directed. i'm not sure why it presents itself as a comedy either, as while it is a tiny bit funny here and there, it seems to be more geared towards advertising for tourism in romania or espousing romanian historical events than anything else. i can't say that it's entirely a bad film, it's just not at all what the description presents it as, and deeply lacks structure in lieu of being some kind of love letter to romania on the director's part. i do not know where the whole sex tape gimmick even fits into this, and it feels glued onto the rest of the footage. i can understand if this is meant to be a feminist piece and one which helps the outside world understand what it's like to be a woman in romania, but in general it's marketed as some kind of indie comedy which it absolutely is not. it's at best an art film and at worst a film student's poorly conceived project.",0
1077,"Worse, most boring film I have ever seen",0
1078,"Romanian writer-director Radu Jude's subversive, salacious satire begins with the showing of a five minute pornographic sex tape. Emi (Katia Passcariu), a history teacher, who is on the tape, becomes subjected to scrutiny when the video is uploaded on a website. Jude structures the movie into three parts. The first section, filmed like a documentary, tracks Emi as she walks around Bucharest trying to deal with the ramifications of the tape, while tensions erupt into feuds among citizens during the pandemic. The second part is a Brechtian essay, presented in montage form, that features definitions, quotes, and archival footage about everything from colonialism, oppression, religion, violence, social distancing, and pornography. It's a history of the horrors of humanity exemplified by Romania and its institutions contrasted with the rather trivial depictions of sexuality that suggests Bunuel. In the third section, filmed as a sitcom, Emi attends a parent-teacher conference where she is confronted by parents and administrators, who are wearing masks due to Covid, to decide her moral fitness for continued employment. The film concludes by presenting three alternate endings with an ingenious, obscene denouement that is immensely satisfying. Radu Jude has combined the sophisticated technique and sensibility of Godard with the outrageous humor of early Woody Allen to create a wholly original critique of censorship, obscenity, privacy, media and hypocrisy. Katia Pascariu gives a superb performance as the highly intelligent teacher. Obscured by a mask for much of the movie, she remains guarded, but her eyes reveal a woman who is reflective and observant, and ready for discord. Jude's depiction of the social conflicts of life in a contemporary European city has a more direct connection to America than perhaps any other movie made in Hollywood in recent years. The movie was presented in censored and uncensored versions. The censored version includes cleverly placed graphics with hilarious commentary over the explicit content. The uncensored version contains explicit imagery. It was banned in multiple countries. Jude won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival. In Romanian with English subtitles.",1
1079,"Tedious and pretentious.  The endless scenes of the lead female character walking around the streets serve no purpose other than to the irritate the viewer.

1082,"Tony had so many friends and admirers, but in the end none were able to truly understand the demons inside. Its often the case with genius minds and the most creative among us. Sad but true. Look past the self-destructive elements for a life full of interest and worth.",1
1083,"Personally liked it a lot!!!  Well done biography with lots of recent footage, as he is hard to forget... Respectfully done with lots of his close friends and lovers.  Great insight to his psyche and thoughts, along with his everyday life over the years. Definitely recommend!!!",1
1084,Amazingly well done go see it!,1
1085,A thought provoking film about an inspiring man.,1
1086,"I gave it a 3.5.  Well done documentary, but we all know the ending.  It is so depressing at the end that you leave with a low disturbed feeling.  That is not the feeling i want to leave with.  Perhaps that is what they wanted?  Just a warning for all of those happy go lucky movie goers.",1
1087,Sad biopic on a life well lived but ending in sadness and darkness. Carefully and beautifully done by Morgan Neville,1
1088,"It felt as if Tony was still alive at the the beginning, but then you realize that he's been gone for a few years. This documentary reveals how he disappointed so many people, both friends and fans alike, and yet showed a lot of his insecurities that so many people are suffering with, whether they are celebrities or not. Just like all of Tony's shows and books, this film will always be in my mind and in my heart. Be a traveller, not a tourist, and be loved.",1
1089,Very well done documentary with a lot of footage from behind the scenes from people that knew him well.,1
1090,"Well done docu on the extraordinary life of Anthony Bourdain drawing on perspectives of family, colleagues and friends to shed light on the life of this very driven, brilliant and charismatic man.",1
1091,"End was too abrupt and a shock. Innovative and inspiring to see theme for first time.... but end seemed stereotypical in that man gets something and woman has to be left with sadness and her body being used.  A richness of understanding perhaps, as an adopted mom of 2 I feel, would be that they definitely restate promise of friendship and for both to be involved in the life of the the child they conceived together.",1

1095,Loved it!  So unexpected and funny and poignant.,1
1096,"Patti Harrison, to block! 
For a subject I couldn't imagine being remotely entertaining and/or amusing... I now stand corrected. The entire cast brings it via such a thoughtfully written, and directed film... but wow, the lovely Ms. Harrison steals the whole thing.  It was fun to watch her do that in such an unaffected, endearing way.  Well done.",1
1097,Hated the ending. It felt unfinished.,1
1098,A nontraditional relationship movie that explores different forms of intimacy. Funny and heartfelt with great performances all around.,1

1110,Good message and music and visuals were fantastic,1
1111,This movie sucks :D you should not watch it. It's boring! It does nothing creative and relies on its brand name of ‘Pixar' to carry it. You'll not be happy you watched it!,1
1112,This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I can't wait to see more Pixar projects like this.,1
1113,"Fun wholesome film that would be good for the whole family, with beautiful animation accompanied by great voice acting and a well written story.",1
1114,"Everything I hoped for and more after seeing the concept art a few years back. I've cried nearly every time I watch it, it's such a sweet comfort film and never fails to cheer me up before punching me in the gut and gently whispering ""look at you. you're crying over two sea monsters being friends and eating funny pasta. look what you have become"" into my ear while I lay doubled over weeping into the dirt",1
1115,Very good movie. Great songs and great voice work. Nice fresh new story and new culture for Disney. Well done ,1

1119,"Kid and Adult friendly movie! I love it Santa Mozarella 😀
Sweet coming of age story I feel like I haven't seen a great coming of age story in a long while. This movie definitely brought me back to my younger days with my friends and learning who I am and taking risks.

I wasn't sure about this movie when I would see the ads. I caught it on Disney plus while at the gym and just fell into the story. I wasn't anticipating on liking it so much but I'm glad I did. It's such a feel good summer story. A must see for kids of all ages! 😀",1

1141,Loved the dancing and singing,1
1142,"I thought it was so beautiful! The talented cast, the cinematography, the costuming, the choreography, the singing--I was somewhat of a crying mess at the end, which I suspected might happen. I thought some of the changes were pretty refreshing. And I have to say: having not seen the original since I was probably a kid myself, seeing this updated version now as an adult, I feel like I understand this story better than I ever did before.",1
1143,Really enjoyed it. Some differences and  updating from the original.,1
1144,"Pros: Great adapted screenplay! Kudos to Mr. Kushner in reimagining a classic in a new way! Incorporation of the history of the neighborhood was well done overall. Actor playing Tony deserves more credit for a wonderful performance along with Rita Moreno. Cons: Transitions between dialogue and musical scenes could have been better along with pacing of the story which at times felt rushed and could have flowed better better in building tensions among the characters at various points. Establishing individual identities of Sharks needed work as they all seemed to blend together visually. (wardrobe and casting issue). The one African American character was rather seemed out of place and cliche. Overall, Mr. Spielberg was successful given the high bar he had in tackling a classic.",1
1145,I'm such a marshmallow - in tears at the end.  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.,1
1146,"Strong, graceful recasting of the original stage play in the setting -- which is unfortunately still quite current -- of low-income housing clearances to make way for an arts center and high-priced dwellings.  An especially wonderful touch:  executive producer Rita Moreno as an added, pivotal character, with her golden moment of singing ""There's a Place for Us.""  Great costumes and sets, colors vibrant and nostalgic, cars classic, very evocative of the mid-1950s.  I suspect that the late composer and lyricist, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, would be very happy.",1
1147,"Cinematography, cultural authenticity, depiction of the slums, music, choreography Maria was excellent l",1

1151,"Sweet, funny, sad, touching.  Great performances.  Loved, loved this movie!",1
1152,"I really quite enjoyed this film for how understated it is and the performance by Monica Dolan as the mother is really, really good. Its surprisingly thoughtful too, or I felt it was. There are some amusing scenes and a good cast including Rob Brydon and Tamsin Greig. It's not exactly a fast paced film or a particularly dramatic film but its a nice film with a slight sense of teenage nostalgia about it and moreso a good dose of sentimentality but not overly cheesy - a real British teen film which is a good piece of social commentary on a single mum trying to look out for her teenage son which I'd happily recommend.",1
1153,This is an ultra pleasant movie. It's so easy to watch and it flows very well. The way its minimalistic approach and contained story mesh with its characters' personalities is very satisfying. A parent/child movie is universally appealing and even more so when it's easy to relate to both characters like it is in Days of the Bagnold Summer. Both Sue and Daniel are such enjoyable and empathetic characters it was pretty tough not to love this wholesome movie.,1
1154,"I love a good independent film about nothing in particular. This one has all of the typical elements: the divorced couple, the dark, brooding loner teenager, the awkward, isolated mom. The Belle & Sebastian soundtrack. Unfortunately it still doesn't work very well. I think it's missing all of the nuance that gives the characters charm and the relatable situations that endear us to the characters. The acting is done well enough, it's just the characters aren't written well enough for us to empathize with them. After an hour of the brooding teen, it just makes you want to turn it off and say a silent prayer for not being stuck with a teen like that. I'm sure those types are out there but this one is written particularly difficulty. I write this all the time in reviews but it's still the biggest part of a film that kills it for audiences: you can write difficult and complex characters without making them wholly unlikeable. Even the most salty teens should have *something* endearing about them and something that allows us to empathize with them. Not all awkward mom characters have to be lost causes and morbidly and clinically depressed. Wes Anderson is an expert at this…without the nuance and quirks, sitting through his movies would be next to impossible. And it's not that hard…nobody is as simple as the worst stereotype a writer can dream up and they shouldn't be in film. Remember: you have to be able to relate to a character (or at least understand him or her) before you can find any interest in their situation. As good as the acting is, these characters are horribly, horribly cliched, simple and depressing. No upside, no asterisk. They're just very hard to tolerate and it makes the plot and the rest of the specifics almost impossible to get engrossed in. I guess I thought this would have some comedic elements. There are none. The only relief you'll get after you're done with this is the fact that you're not living their lives. And honestly just the fact that it's over.",0
1155,Not bad but didn’t bring much to the table 2.5,0
1156,"A lovely addition to the coming of age/family drama department, 'Days of the Bagnold Summer' is based on a graphic novel and it was lovely for a hubby and wife date afternoon.  The film is about the relationship of a mother and a son and they duo of Monica Dolan and Earl Cave have a wonderful chemistry.  It's a picture for people who are awkward.  British subtle comedy (and sometimes not so subtle) is not for everyone.  Rob Brydon and Alice Lowe are terrific in supporting rolls.  Cave is a talent to watch.   Hubby: 8.8/Wife: 7.8 Average: 8.3/10",1
1157,"The directorial debut from former The Inbetweeners star Simon Bird is a funny and charming coming of age story that follows the dysfunctional relationship between a moody and nihilistic teenager and his depressed divorcee mother as they are forced to spend an entire summer together.

The film manages to capture perfectly the awkwardness of British adolescence and Earl Cave sells the pretentious and mopey teenager that is all too familiar to me. Monica Dolan was also great as Daniel's mum Sue and the use of Belle & Sebastian contrasted by heavy metal in the soundtrack was a great choice to mirror the inherent central conflict of the film.

It's a fairly standard and simplified story and the film lulls quite badly in the middle section, but it shows promise for the future career for Simon Bird. Maybe he was made to be behind the camera and not in front of it.",0
1158,I loved everything about this! Recommended! I was giggling and misty eyed at the same time!!,1
1159,"Meh...the mom's cool. The kid reeks of so many cliches, but unfortunately, cliches exist cuz there's history behind them. 
Not funny enough for the premise, which is already worn the hell out times 5. 2.3 stars cuz I liked the kids with the band...of sorts.",0
1160,"Not a great movie. Maybe it's just me because Tomatometer gave it a 92% and the Audience score was 89%. I'm really scratching my head over the 2 ratings. I thought the movie was as dull as the lives of the 2 main characters in the movie. Matter of fact, I may have had the same expression on my face as I watched the movie, as the kid did in the movie.",0
1161,"Bringing together the insights and words of two legendary writers in one film is an intriguing approach to the biographical documentary genre, an approach employed cleverly and skillfully in this offering from director Lisa Immordino Vreeland. By combining archive interview footage of the two literary icons with voiceover narrations of their writings read by Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto, viewers see a picture emerge not only of these two gifted artists, but also the parallels between their respective backgrounds, the nature of their longstanding friendship and the ways in which their personal lives influenced their work. These discussions are supplemented by numerous clips from film and television adaptations of their novels and plays, including ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Baby Doll,"" ""Night of the Iguana,"" ""The Glass Menagerie,"" ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""In Cold Blood,"" to name a few. While this release is not always especially revelatory about either of these well-known individuals, it's nevertheless quite intimate and authentic in their on-screen depiction, especially in the archive interviews conducted by David Frost, Dick Cavett and Tom Brokaw. If nothing else, this film puts an interesting spin on its material and brings its protagonists back to life, even if only for a little while.",1
1162,"Un principio excelente, que a medida que pasan las extensas situaciones de road movie, se pierde el interés y uno pide el fin de la película",0
1163,"Very tense thriller,quite scary and lots of violence.
Not for everyone!  But I thought it was made good with good actors.",1
1164,A lot of people shoehorn this movie into edgy moral shapes or attempt to describe it as dark but original. Nope. It's just violent and sad. I did not finish it and neither should you. Do better than me and avoid the play button.,0
1165,"Interesting structure but... the motives failed to convince me and and there was no tension or suspense after a certain point, it was more like watching a chess match... a very violent chess match.",0
1166,"This is the rare occasion where I agree with the critics. The central theme that bad things inevitably come to pass when good people stay silent in the face of evil is blisteringly embodied by the magnificent acting performances of the nihilistic sociopath and his companion. The legacy of abuse across generations is subtly and not so subtly transfused into the fabric of the movie and it is a credit to the director and actors that it is a decent horror, while at the same exploring themes of abuse, vengeance and redemption. Well worth a look even if it's just to see the performance of Gillies as Mandrake.",1
1167,Unleashed psychopathic violence rooted in a past of abuse is always more terrifying than any supernatural horror story you can get. These kind of beast are REALLY out there...,1
1168,"Nice to see a horror genre movie from NZ. The acting was pretty good, suspense was good  but predictable. The main reason the family is targeted seems too flimsy for the action which takes place. The plot could have been more intense.",0
1169,Definitely kept me on edge… would highly recommend watching,1
1170,"New Zealand's equivalent of Funny Games, albeit with a bit less sadistic glee in the suffering of the protagonists. The ending felt like a bit of a letdown and there certainly was a bunch of padding for time with driving scenes, but overall it presents itself as a compelling and competent thriller.",1
1171,‘Coming Home in the Dark' is a Nihilistic Morality Thriller,0
1172,I loved this film.  Absurd but it draws you in.  Such an engaging fly.  The final shot made me laugh right through the credits.,1
1173,"The teaser trailer that's just a clip of Adele Exarchopoulis reacting to the fly is the only moment that really made me laugh, but even in context, that moment is tainted by the immediately unfunny turn of the following scene. Spoilers: the accusation made against Exarchopoulis's character and the actions of the other characters after this scene was so disturbing and unfunny to me, it ruined what little enjoyment I had with the previous 2/3rds of the film. I just walked away feeling sick and sad for her character. The plot treats her as though it doesn't matter what happens to her because her condition makes her ""difficult"". In the filmmaker's eyes she's ""crazy"" and by extension completely irredeemable. It just made me super concerned for her character. What message does that send, that there's a trope in filmmaking where mentally ill people are portrayed as a disposable hassle? I see this one a lot, but this is the most obvious example I can think of. The problem is that It normalizes the abuse of neuro-divergent people and that effects the way they're treated in real life.",0
1174,"I rather liked Quentin Dupieux's last film, Deerskin, but Mandibles lost me early or perhaps it's better said that I lost Mandibles.  It has a giant fly and it's off the wall and original, however it didn't connect.  Perhaps it's because it's in French and there's nuance to the humor in the language that doesn't translate to English.  Nevertheless, we have a comedy that isn't funny.  Despite being 78 minutes, it feels much longer.  Could have made for a pretty neat short.  You may want to find out what Dupieux was smoking and/or drinking to enjoy his film and that isn't a good thing.  Final Score: 4/10",0
1175,"I've seen horrible, terrible movies like carnosaur, the blob, critters, that one horrible movie about a Mormon guy refusing to bang a cutie Polynesian girl, and some other terrible piles of sh*t, but this one is in the realm of terrible beyond salvation and also somehow praised by some pretentious douchebags who claimed ""oh it's so experimental"", blegh, what a waste of an hour and some minutes if I could go back in time I would punch myself for exposing myself to this hot garbage.",0

1183,"Fantastic, heartwarming Anything John Krasinski directs is magnificent",1
1184,"With the right Material Jessica Barden could be great is what we learn from Nicole Riegel's first feature film.  Unfortunately, the interesting premise becomes all too familiar and cliche ridden.  We're taken out of the film when Donald Trump's voice becomes prominent.  I don't know what the moving is trying to say.  It is completely ordinary.  Who knew scrap metal could be sound deadly?  Final Score: 4.3/10",0
1185,"Making a film with familiar subject matter and circumstances only works when the narrative includes characters who credibly fit the scenario. Unfortunately, that's the downfall of writer-director Nicole Riegel's meandering debut feature about an intelligent but rough-hewn high school senior who takes up rogue scrap metal pilfering as a means to earn money to attend college and thereby extract herself from the small Ohio Rustbelt town where she grew up (and would not have much of a future). Despite a seemingly plausible story line, many of the specific events that it incorporates are a stretch, often going underdeveloped or wholly unresolved. That's especially true of incidents involving the spitfire protagonist, most of which seem to mistakenly rely on her gritty-edged personality as the rationale for their inclusion, regardless of whether or not they're believable or effectively brought to conclusion. The casting is somewhat questionable, too, particularly the selection of a 28-year-old actress to play an 18-year-old character, a flawed choice that not even makeup and costuming can effectively conceal. While the film does feature some superb cinematography and a realistic production design, those attributes are hard-pressed to make up for the other shortcomings. Perhaps much of this can be chalked up to this being the filmmaker's first full-length outing (let's hope so).",0
1186,"From the first scene of Holler to the last image, there's no question or doubt about what movie you're seeing; no dualism or magical realism you go in and out of. What we see through the bleak blue screen scenery of DP Dustin Lane's 16 mm camera work is the bleak dreary life of small industrial towns where 'the factory/plant/mine' is what keeps the town existing. And when they close down, so do the towns and those who populate it. 
The emotional angst, depression, and frustration are so palpable, which is so impressive in that director Nicole Riegel, a veteran of just such a town in southern Ohio, and the strong cast, were able to bring such authenticity and development of mood in under 90 minutes of filmmaking. Credit here, again, to Riegel for her tight script and the editing skills of Kate Hickey. These are some talented women working in the movie industry who hopefully will keep producing films of such quality for many years to come. 
The performances of Halpert, Adlon, Amelio and Baker are all strong. These are people we believe in, maybe people we know. The veterans Baker and Adlon bring a lot of years worth of quality work as many different people into the characters of Linda and Rhonda. We pull for both of them. But this is young Jessica Barden's movie, start to finish. From the opening scene of her running desperately with snagged bags of aluminum, to the end, this is Ruth's story most of all. 
A great many movies/directors try to bring these kinds of story lines to life; the struggles of blue-collar workers in a world where technology and corporatism use them then lose them. There's the kids divided between leaving for the promise of more or staying home in the only life they've ever known with the family they love. But so often, they show some empathy for the weight of such struggle, but not the weight itself. Riegel does not fail to bring it all to the show. 3.9 stars",1

1188,I loved every minute of it! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,1
1189,I really enjoyed this engaging ride that Alex Dall was on an could relate to her to an extent. Isabelle Fuhrman's performance as Alex has left me in a state of awe. I am very reluctant to consume media centered around sports(not my special interest) but this one really stuck with me and I am happy that I watched it. Who knew Rowing could be so engaging to watch. The cinematography and soundtrack were also a plus. It felt real. We could toll that this obsession toke on Alex and I would be lying if I said I was still rooting for her in the end. Would definitely recommend this to people who are able to fully grasp the issues this film tackles and it really pains me to tell you that there isn't much publicity or user generated content on this film online. Maybe we should change that.,1

1195,"I liked the first 50 minutes or so, although it was slow in developing characters but I hung with it. The development of just how dangerous her OCD behaviors were during this year of her life sometimes left me confused. Then the emphasis on the final race, the record time, the rule of ""first sign of lightning"" disregarded, the poorly orchestrated race sequence at the end, Brill under a foil blanket in the boat house, all this leading to a display of her ""cutting"" while quitting the team to end the movie, just didn't work. It needed 15 more minutes to provide some more depth to the story line",0
1196,Such a good movie. Powerhouse performance from Fuhrman,1
1197,"This movie is about an intense, overachieving, and quite frankly masochistic novice rower at a small college. It draws you into the frenetic training regimen and the drama and backstabbing of a small college sports team and it's really more about the dark side than any sort of triumph or overcoming of the odds. It's a unique, eccentric sports film, an edgy college film.",1
1198,Udo Kier is great and there are some enjoyable moments but this is a bit mawkish for my taste,0
1199,"Beautiful inter generational Gay story.  Colorful characters, love, being true to oneself.",1
1200,"I really enjoyed a previous film Todd Stephens wrote called ""Edge of Seventeen"" which had the same Midwestern setting as this one, which made me want to see ""Swan Song"". This is a much slower film which deals with small town life from the point of view of a retired hairdresser, Pat, living in a retirement home. After one of his wealthy clients who he had a falling out with a long time ago passes away and instructs her executor to engage Pat to do her hair one more time, he makes his way out of the retirement home and across Sandusky Ohio and his lifetime of memories, friends, and frenemies, to the funeral home, for one last job. I suppose Hollywood has accustomed us to follow the lives of the young and active, which may make this seem like a bit of a slog, and it did feel that way, but there was an emotional pay off in the end that made it worth it.",1
1201,"Writer-director Todd Stephens' no-frills indie film is, according to its opening titles, inspired by a true icon, a flamboyant gay hairdresser (as if there's any other kind in reality) called Pat Pitsenbarger who did wealthy ladies' hair in Sandusky, Ohio. If the poster had you thinking Terence Stamp, that's actually Udo Kier, a face familiar to fans of action B-movies as he's often cast as the Euro heavy. With his German accent intact, and a delivery style that's part menacing, part disdain, and all defensive mechanism, his Pitsenbarger is a bitter man who's out of place and out of time (in both sense of the phrase), having lived a life as a gay man during a very different and more conservative time than the present day. Now residing in a mundane retirement home with his grey sweatpants, the death of Linda Evans' local socialite and ex-client who specifies Pitsenbarger in her will to do her hair and make-up kickstarts a road movie, mostly on foot, of self rediscoveries, where old haunts are revisited as he gathers what he needs for the job. It's a simple yet perfectly workable narrative mechanism to hang little glimpses of his life story on, about the love of his life or his rivalry with Jennifer Coolidge's mentee-turned-competitor, but it can also be clunky at times. The film is kitsch and fairly niche, just like its subject matter, and Stephens' dreamy indie tendencies can get in the way, producing some less than smooth editing that at times look like there's a scene missing here and there. If you can get over this, this works best as a melancholic exploration of ageing, loneliness and regrets especially in the context of someone who has lost his sparkle after outliving everyone else he holds dear around him.",0
1202,"A little clunky at times, but the pay off is worth it. Heartfelt and beautiful...",1
1203,"Doing justice cinematically to a real-life icon can be a tricky proposition; sometimes it turns out right, and sometimes it doesn't. But the thorniest cases seem to be those that are caught somewhere in between, as is apparent in this fact-based memoir about a flamboyant gay Sandusky, OH, hairdresser and make-up artist. When stylist Pat Pitsenbarger is called out of retirement to handle the cosmetology duties for one of his former clients who has recently passed away, he escapes the nursing home where he's been recovering from a stroke -- and not having much of a life. His rascally adventure in the outside world takes him back to the haunts of his old life, where he confronts a number of ghosts from his past and gets a chance to see how much the LGBTQ community has changed since his heydays of running the streets. It's an experience that's both fun and melancholic for him, especially given his awareness of the fact that, like his departed patron, his days may be dwindling, too. The execution of his odyssey, however, is somewhat uneven, characterized by a number of superbly handled touching moments and others that feel clumsy and somewhat cryptic. This could be attributable to the filmmaker being too close to the material, or it might be a case of trying to pay proper reverence to a beloved individual but not quite always knowing exactly how. Much of it works, thankfully, due in large part to the excellent lead performance of Independent Spirit Award nominee Udo Kier, but even that fine portrayal isn't always enough to smooth out the rough patches that unavoidably intrude on the flow of the narrative. Writer-director Todd Stephens serves up a generally sold work here, though some deliberate, nuanced tweaking in spots likely would have taken good material and made it better. Viewers should note that this film is not to be confused with another 2021 release of the same name featuring Mahershala Ali in the lead role (though, intriguingly, both pictures deal with issues of mortality in distinctive and inventive ways). Mr. Pat certainly was a colorful character, but it's somewhat unfortunate that this offering doesn't show off all of his hues as it might have.",1
1204,This touching film shows a gay man at the end of his life.  The acting is superb and helps you share his thoughts of bygone days.  'Live until you die' should be the name of this flick.,1
1205,"I was so moved by the performance of Udo Kier.  I came to love him and his journey and how he moves through it and reconciles his many losses in his own way with dignity.  In spite of the appearance of despair he triumphantly ""escapes"" on his own terms as he takes stock of his life and those within it.",1
1206,"This indie-feeling movie is entirely held together by the strength of the Udo Kier. Michael Urie also makes a good appearance. The movie can feel draggy at times, but Udo carries it well.",0
1207,"Loved everything about this movie, it is very slow but completely worth it. The theme, the gadgets, the actors, everything was so well done!!!",1
1208,Absolutely brilliant writing. So many subtle hilarious moments. Such a simple gem of entertainment. ,1
1209,"Hated every character, total waste of time....",0
1210,"Absolutely ridiculous movie…but my 20 year old daughter and I were up for something silly and this fit the bill. If you are looking for a brainless hour and half of fun and stupidity, this is it. Enjoy this bonkers movie!",1
1211,Brought me back to my childhood. It has a lot of flaws and overcomes them with buckets of charm. Good if you after a silly time.,1
1212,"This is like a combination of anime and Giallo horror.  It is scary gory and laugh out loud funny.  Some might call that tone whiplash but I think they handle the balance pretty well.  More scary than funny but when it's funny, it's really funny.  Also that Mimi kid is scary without looking like a monster. Wednesday Addams would tell her to tune down the creep factor.  I wish the ending was slightly better but it doesn't ruin it.  A fun, funny and disturbing horror comedy.",1
1213,"Over-the-top, cheesy & campy fun. Felt very much like an homage to both 80's shows like Voltron or some horror movies & some early 90's stuff like Power Rangers, specifically the costumes. Was like a GWAR concert.",1
1214,"Power Rangers meets Gwar. Tons of gore with practical effects. The few computer effects are purposefully awful. It's campy, fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.",1
1215,"Super gory and campy, lots of fun",1
1216,"An absurdist horror masterpiece. It's just so silly, you can't help but find it endearing.",1
1217,An enjoyable movie with just enough to keep you entertained. Liked the performance of the lead actor (young female kid).,1
1218,"Especially good if you've seen Part I!  Not a film for everyone, but if you like film and the making of film, it's quite an interesting piece!",0
1219,Beautiful movie. Better than Part 1. Richard Ayoade brought some great laughs.,1
1220,“This is cinema! Not something you watch with your uncle.”,1
1221,Strictly for true devotees of cinema,1
1222,Not sure the meta surrealism at the end entirely worked for me but you have to give it credit for being audacious. Also maybe the most accurate movie I’ve ever seen about being in film school. Just really good overall and superior in most ways to the first part.,1
1223,"I personally particularly enjoy single-location movies, so my review is slightly positively biased. 
In the movie, we are looking to a couple of hours of a family thanksgiving dinner of a newly-moved-in couple and their family. Throughout the movie, we see people unreveal themselves, their secrets and their perceptions of one-another, unfortunately only a little of which are really realistic. For example the conversations were too short to be deep enough, however the topics covered were deep and important. How did the characters react? They overreacted for a second and then the scene continued with a completely new topic/cut. If the topics that were mentioned were realistically discussed, the movie would take at least 3 hours. It was completely rushed.
The movie was mostly based on drama, with (to my taste) pretty unnecessary sprinkles of jump-scare-horror scenes. However, despite the blunt plot, the movie was still endurable and (to some degree) enjoyable.",0
1224,"This movie takes forever to explain the characters, using boring dialogue that's honest and endearing but not ""funny"".  You'll have the occasional heh, and that's about it.  We spent the first 45 minutes bored and then moved on to something else.  Rented this movie based on the high rotten tomatoes score by the critics and immediately regretted it.",0
1225,"The best thing about the movie is the excellent actors... its a dark comedy and hilarous at times... but its kind of depressing and boring.  Seems to go on too long with the same drudgery, wants to be a horror film.",0
1226,"I suppose at least partly due to the covid quarantine there has occurred a renaissance in films with strikingly new and inspired scripts and visuals.

""Humans"" is one such example.  The suspense, created by an ongoing series of sinister old-building sound effects that shock the systems both of the father in the story and the audience.  These effects serve to continuously blur the line between the natural and what could be supernatural.

The cast works as a brilliant ensemble of fully realized individuals, each with his or her fascinating quirks and traits.  Those with an appetite for family psycho-drama will not be disappointed.

The crumbling building serves as an allegory for the disintegrating psyche of the affrighted father who, by the end, is experiencing the overwhelming physical effects of the continual angst and panic he's been experiencing throughout.  His mother, now completely debilitated by dementia, is shown frequently with her head lolling or curled up in deep sleep - revealing the future of her son who is already showing symptoms of psychic disintegration.   

I'm finding that these recent films require going online for an explanation and that is full proof of their complexity and ingenuity.",1
1227,"A beautiful combination of script, acting, and sound effect/production about a horrifying reality of life. Houdyshell and Jenkins give absolutely outstanding performances, which create a piece of art felt long after it is all finished.",1
1228,"The Humans is a beautifully crafted and wonderfully acted film that flows with great skill and offers plenty to any viewer. It's reflective and wise, a bit of rarity in 2022. Based on a one act play by Stephen Karam it takes place over one night in one apartment in New York. Karam also wrote and directed this film and did a superb job. Three generations of one family come together for Thanksgiving in the unfurnished apartment of Brigid and her partner Richard. The apartment has many issues such as damp and leaks and poor lighting. Brigid's sister Aimee and her parents and grandmother join the night for a party of six. Over a few hours we live through the travails and issues as each family member vents or speaks on various family issues. Acting is stellar here, especially Richard Jenkins and Steven Yeun. And even though it all occurs in a confined space the film feels cinematic thanks to artful direction and a warm and humane script that is both candid and funny. I treasured this film.",1
1229,Very long and drawn out movie. The only bright part was they were progressive in including a lesbian breakup between Aimee Schumer and another woman. It's not enough to pair interracial couples in most movies anymore. Interracial couples are firmly established in any media including movies. Now we have to cement lesbian and gay relationships in every movie and media platform. Then move onto transsexuals being included in every movie very soon. Disney promised to be progressive and include my gay and transsexual or transgender cartoon characters. Yea for Disney for grooming our 2-12 year olds kids to this alternative lifestyle!,0
1230,it shows me how I can give a movie half star :),0
1231,"I thought the characters were authentically developed in both dialogue and life situations, and very well-acted by all cast members.
The typical awkwardness of family holiday get-togethers is magnified by the dismal, unfurnished, highly-ergonomically-inconvenient apartment.  I never became at ease with it, as I'm sure was true of all family members.  But it's a darkly amusing kind of unease.
Many poignant moments, funny moments, and much buried pain make this a high-quality film.  Not necessarily on Thanksgiving, though!",1
1232,"THANKSGRATING
A one act play in a crumbly, mouldy, creaky, vacuous, claustrophobic, dark, frigid house, well, apartment, that brings together a family full of secrets and dreads for a thankless Thanksgiving dinner makes an adept transition from stage to screen.

Kin strife over an uncomfortable, obligatory gathering is nothing new, but writer and director Stephen Karam has a few swell tricks up his sleeve. Shot in murky shadows, focusing on physical apartment wounds (water stains, paint bubbles, cracks), and jarring sound clashes (garbage trucks, door creaks, lead footed neighbours, outdoor cacophony), ""The Humans"" is an unsettling horror score full of jump scares that delivers gratuitous verbal violence of the meanest kind: family back stabs.

Never leaving the premises, Karam traps his prisoners in a two story dungeon joined by a treacherous spiral staircase. Possible escape routes are endless hallways which everyone is powerless to employ but for brief respites before returning to the battle rooms. Back stories are revealed gradually over chatter and drinks, sometimes whispers, often from a distance and to the side, as the camera lens trains on the space structure rather than the humans within. Unsettling to good effect.

An excellent ensemble cast brings the word spar to fast beating life, headed up by Richard Jenkins' brilliantly flawed father figure. It is one damn fine performance. Turns out comedian Amy Schumer does drama, and does it quite well. She is a revelation. More of this to come for sure. There isn't a weak acting link here, impressive for an all in the family affair who take turns digging digs, opening wounds, consoling hurts, and opening hearts. Emotional turmoil for the everyday person, stuck in a squeamish situation of personal circumstance, battling relationship demons whilst strapping on a brave mask. Life.

This thing won a Tony, and will probably show up at the Oscars. Acting is back baby!

1233,Another masterpiece from celebrated film maker Steven Soderberg. The entire cast shines and I was on the edge of my seat throughout. Superb!,1
1234,"Reasonably well executed, not bad, not amazing.",0
1235,"Great movie, great cast with a naturally humorous delivery in the most subtle way",1
1236,"A richly layered Steven Soderbergh heist-noir film with a star-studded ensemble cast.  It is never boring, but there were a few plot points that came out of right field.  An enjoyable ride, and if you like it you'll excuse a few foibles and if you don't you'll probably hate it.  There may be a twist two many, but I was in a trying to keep up mood!  Final Score: 7.7/10",1
1237,"Intriguing and slightly convoluted film portraying capitalism at its most savage: for trade secrets, some poor risk-takers get burned, some nobodies stay as such, but alive, and the top guns are well-protected and get richer. Maybe a bit of spoilers there, but this kept my interest, but not my wife's.",1
1238,"I have no idea why critics liked this. It starts out well but falls so far off a cliff it becomes incomprehensible and boring. It tries so hard to be clever that it becomes ridiculous, confusing, and totally uninteresting. The only thing keeping you from turning it off is the bizarre curiosity in seeing how they will possibly tie off the story threads. One of the worst things I've seen in long,  long time.",0
1239,"1ya- While it's not destined to be some ultimately classic film, it manages to be a charming and clever ride that is made all the better by an amazing cast, particularly when Del Toro and Cheadle share the screen.",1
1240,No Sudden Move has its good moments. Although these are dotted throughout and can't help the boring moments disappear. Some funny parts and good acting by Cheadle. A rewarding watch for fans of the genre.,0
1241,"horrible horrible horrible.... save your time, save your life...",0
1242,"One would have hoped that with the cast assembled, the writing and direction would do the movie some justice ? At times, it's either utterly confusing or downright boring. As for Don Cheadles' voice, what is all that about ?",0
1243,"Worth watching just for the visual! Filmed in B&W with the aspect ratio and shot entirely digital, it looks conceptual and quite spatial as if viewing an architectural model of a stage from different angles. There are many Macbeth adaptation films in history, and this is one of the latest contemporary version with American casting. Actually its good to put weight on visual challenge as the story is known. Maybe references from older Scandinavian films like The Seventh Seal by Bergman.",1
1244,It's nothing more than the original text.,0
1245,"Messy cgi, terrible voice recordings, awful green screening is saved by a compelling and well written story. I honestly think the cast was really good and Denzel Washington saves the film.",0
1246,"Coming from Joel Coen I thought it would be more of a retelling, a Macbeth with a twist (well, even more twist than original). I am a little dissapointed they were no changes plot wise but it is still a great adaptation. The actors are just amazing (Frances McDormand was born to play lady Macbeth) and although the scenography is really simple i think it looks great with the way the movie was shot. It's almost theatrical and makes you focus on what director wants you to see in the story. Every shot is like an individual photo, the composition is never accidental and the contrast between light and shadow makes it look just so beautiful. It's not an easy thing, putting so many colors in a black and white movie.",1
1247,"Macbeth was great, beautifully shot, excellently acted but also just Macbeth when you get down to it",1
1248,"The Tragedy of Macbeth presented me with a visual feast reminiscent of Sin City. Even though it's still my favorite Macbeth 71 model, this Macbeth is one of the best I've seen. I especially loved the director's use of witches. They were never so significant before. So for that, congratulations to Joel Coen. It's a completely satisfying visual feast.",1
1249,I'm not even going to watch it because of the ridiculous casting.,0
1250,What an astonishing work of art! The cast was felicitous with a most auspicious performance. When you make a deal with the devil your debt will be paid. Denzel plays such an avaricious character with flawless ability. Shakespeare is truly legendary.,1
1251,Another great piece from Coen.  Good to see Apple tv+ getting some good releases.,1
1252,"I had never actually seen Macbeth before, but only came across excerpts here and there and was very excited for a Cohen adaptation to be my complete introduction to it.  The feel was good, the direction strong, the acting good and the writing well, it was tragic.  McDormand and Washington's accents distracted at times, despite their strong presences.  The play ultimately left me feeling hollow and I understand that that was its purpose.  I was not a fan of some of the other actors like the man in the robe.  He seemed out of place.  The witches were the most powerful and ominous of all, casting their creepy mysticism on the characters.  Shakespeare is still powerful and I have to sometimes have the right frame of mind to comprehend all the words.  It's like a switch to another language that I have to turn on.  But, once it's on you find yourself thinking with the rhythm and words of Shakespeare.  Props for doing it.  It was on Apple TV.",0
1253,ass bad no good make me angry,0
1254,"Very original coming of age story, and a highly moving and shocking piece of cinema. The film stays with you long after viewing, and leaves you in unable to move as the credits roll. I found the film to be very impressive, and a great piece of work.",1
1255,"Simple, some good acting, visually sharp. Gaps in story, but generally ok if somewhat unbelievable at times. Incredibly shocking moment that doesn't quite make up for the rest of the film's trudge. It was ok.",0
1256,"A slow moving (too slow) film with excellent acting, which has its moments, but is derailed by a sloppy ending.",0
1257,"Obvious comparisons to Animal Kingdom aside, Wildland never truly gets itself going. It's a bleak film with uncompelling characters that feels longer than it is. Nevertheless, there's something about it that keeps you watching throughout. I'm not sure whether it's something I'd recommend, but I doubt I'll ever be watching it again.",0
1258,"Naturalistically raw, simple but not simplistic an effective dive into northern europe creepy mafia roughness. Carried along by a greatly efficient cast, with a gripping score and a discreet directing it ends up being a short but enjoyable punch in the guts.",1
1259,This is one of the best documentaries movie whatever you wanna call it I have ever seen it is warm hearted it is educational it is funny it is fun it is interesting in the first 20 minutes aren't very good but this documentary is absolutely amazing must see 100%,1
1260,The best movie of 2020. I fell in love with the octopus!,1
1261,Heartstrings are pulled. The relationship between man and animal is shown insatiable. I never seen a documentary that shows beginning to end with such passion.,1
1262,"Mesmerizing! I never thought I would care so much about an octopus, although not to the level of the diver which felt overly dramatized. (89%)",1
1263,"A very fascinating documentary showing insights to the Octopus and how they live.  It was touching, informative and entertaining.  Well made to boot.  I saw it because it was recommended.  It was on Netflix.",1
1264,"One of the most amazing things with a human being is the ability to connect to nature and other beings. Although in the times, this has been the least understood thing by humans - a story like this comes and shows you a new world of possibilities. Here comes a story of a man who followed a life of an Octopus over 300 days to not just fell in love with her but to find new meaning and direction for his life by learning from her. 
It may feel like just another documentary from Discovery days but you as you start to connect this as a life story of Craig Foster, it starts to hit you as more than just a documentary. Craig who was raised on the shores of South African sea when returns to his home after burning out from working for far too long and feeling disconnected to his family - finds a new passion in diving in the sea to explore wild-life beneath the water. It is his journey to find and connect with an underwater octopus and learn more about her as he starts to dive in every-day for around a year. 
The documentary has some amazing moments where he first touches the Octopus, carries her on him, the outstanding Shark chases and her incredible intelligence to save herself. More importantly, while all this happening - he starts to unearth new connections with nature, his family and finds a new meaning to life; in the end when he starts a Sea Change project. In one of the heart-broken scenes where Octopus is dying after the reproduction process and Shark finally takes her away; you can't stop yourself from getting a tear or two in your eye. This is all due to the connection Craig develops and as viewers, we do the same. It has some amazing portrayal of unknown facts about Octopus as a creature and Craig starts dreaming about her as he further deep dive. 
I wonder if I should have seen this in a theatre as the shots and cinematography is wildly amazing. The background score was brilliant and it brings a lot of tense moments in the Shark chasing scenes. As it's a real-life story - Craig who also produced the film has narrated well. You could feel him re-exploring himself, his newfound passion and connecting with his son where he shares this journey with him. I know that content like this is not very popular with mainstream OTT viewers but it's a hidden gem. People who can connect with this will have the potential to explore a new wave of life. 
5/5. Please watch it on Netflix along with your kid. If nothing else, you will start to appreciate the life of wild creatures beyond human beings. For a planet that is dying, it's a great achievement! 
Sayonara!",1

1266,"A little diving venture led to amazing discovery that then sparked an unexpected bond when man and nature truly connects, and the storyteller sharing his discovery, no, story, crafted it so beautifully and connectively resonating as it affected him to become capable of switching on our empathies in feeling their bond that aquatically radiates in imprints via screen when sharing his educative fascination and protective instincts. (A-)",1
1267,Captivating and beautiful to watch. This documentary moved me.,1
1268,"At the least, very educational on the eco system of a sea forest.",1
1269,This is awful! It's just a bad tv film,0
1270,I loved this movie because it demonstrated the reality that pregnancy and motherhood do not define a woman or a marriage/romantic relationship.  The main characters' rugged individualism allowed for healthy ways of relating and disagreeing ultimately ending with a positive outlook for their future.,1
1271,"The Lead Actress Is A Wet-Blanket..As Much As It Tries To Get Funny Moments Going, The Push By Her Actor-Compadre Is Just Not Reciprocating In Jokes Hitting Their Mark. Maybe Story Looked Good On Paper!? I Didn't Find It Funny.",0

1273,Pretty boring and predictable. Save an hour & a half  and pick something else to watch.,0
1274,"What a mess.  It's not funny and it's often repulsing, but the leading duo of Rose Matafeo and Matthew Lewis are fine.  The film can't pick a lane and tries to be daring, but it comes off as over the top and unrealistic.  The conclusion comes out of nowhere and makes no sense.  My wife dodged a bullet missing this one.  Final Score: 4/10",0

1279,"Some what informative but I feel no closer to knowing who Truman Capote was as a person. These are accounts of people giving their version of Capote that only paint a partial picture of who this man was. I only feel somewhat compelled to look into what he wrote, namely Breakfast at Tiffanys, but only somewhat. Usually after watching a great documentary I feel captivated and want to look into what I watched on a more specific scholarly level. With this one, only somewhat. They should have included more Truman in this to have a more balanced feel for who he was.",0
1280,"Never boring, much like the subject, Truman Capote, 'The Capote Tapes' prove not to be nearly as interesting as the man itself.  The film doesn't answer many questions, but sheds an ever-present spotlight on a man ahead of his time, who didn't age gracefully.  Ebs Burnough makes his filmmaking debut in this documentary which uses tons of old pictures and video to bring Capote to his vibrant glory.  While we're never going to know the exact story of Capote, his legendary tales have been recorded via TV Talk shows and his mind never let the truth get in the way of a story.  While truth is stranger than fiction, it's impossible to decipher what is real and what's not and for a movie like this that's ok.  If your goal is to be entertained, you will be. Final Score: 8/10",1
1281,"I typically love documentaries especially about someone as colorful and mysterious as Capote. However, Capote Tapes, turned out to be a snoozer. I fell asleep.",0
1282,"Flamboyant, openly gay author Truman Capote may not have been especially prolific, but he wrote several noteworthy, well-respected works. However, when excerpts of what was supposed to be his crowning achievement – the novel Answered Prayers about the dirty little secrets of New York high society based on the lives of a number of his ""friends"" – he became a pariah of sorts, losing contact with many of those close to him and triggering a speedy downward spiral in his health and well-being. In this new documentary, excerpts of recorded interviews with many of his friends and colleagues and new interviews with those who knew him and studied his work shed light on the enigmatic icon, his life and his writing, particularly with regard to his final and unfinished work. Included are archive segments featuring Lauren Bacall, Candice Bergen, George Plimpton, Norman Mailer, Lee Radziwill, Harper Lee, William F. Buckley and Capote's partner Jack Dunphy, along with new conversations with author Jay McInerney, journalist Sally Quinn, Vogue editor André Leon Talley and talk show host Dick Cavett, among others. Director Ebs Burnough's debut feature presents a captivating look at a talented, troubled and towering figure.",1
1283,"A beautifully bad example of nepotism...or how a 21yo is given to make a movie about nothing because she is the daughter of stars actors. Completely shallow, a movie about things nobody care and the sweet torment of privileges. It's not even well written or acted and has nothing for it going on. It cannot even manage well its influence. Only good thing here it is smart enough to be pretty short.",0
1284,"I'm completely at a loss to understand the undeserving fascination with this highly unfocused, heavily padded, meandering tale of a teenager bored with her peer group who falls in love with a 35-year-old actor. Though billed as a romance and a comedy, it's not much of either, but then that's probably because this isn't much of a movie. The script is so slight that it's hard to fathom what the real story was intended to be, due to its inconsequential dialogue, uninspired narrative and a plethora of sequences that are wholly mundane. As a consequence, writer-actor-director Suzanne Lindon's debut feature quickly becomes a tedious bore, and that's with a scant 73-minute runtime, too. Pay no attention to the hype that critics are lauding on this underdeveloped, meritless mess.",0

1300,"Pray Away meticulously details the horrors wrought by organized religion, in this case conversion therapy inflicted on homosexuals by the Christian organization Exodus International.  Told primarily from the perspective of those who have gone through the ugly process, it puts the spotlight on an inhumane practice that serves to degrade the humanity of its victims all while under the delusion that it is guided by a loving and compassionate god.  There are times when it feels as though there are simply too many talking heads, but it remains a powerful and touching documentary of a grotesque practice that is still accepted by some Evangelicals.",1
1301,"An important documentary which follows five evangelicals in the 1970s who formed Exodus International, a group that claims that gay people can become straight through prayer and conversion therapy. Here they contend with the aftermath unleashed by their actions, while a survivor seeks healing and acceptance from more than a decade of trauma. This empathetic film deals with the far-reaching effects and inevitably tragic damage that this kind of ""therapy"" can inflict on vulnerable lives and how awful and traumatic it is. It should forever be condemned, but it is very satisfying to see the previous leaders of the movement come to their senses and be the ones speaking out about these horrors and their mistakes.",1
1302,Freakin fantastic! This movie needed to be made.,1

1313,"I didn't finish the movie and yes it's not my cup of tea. But I read some spoilers and I really love the story and how the director handled well the young artists. 😊 AND ALSO, DO NOT PUT HORROR GENRE IF IT WERE ALL A DRAMA! PSYCHO!😡",0
1314,Martyrs Lane is slow and incoherent but a couple of solid performances by its young leads makes it worth watching.,0
1315,You've seen the type before...the gone girl giving clues to her identity. This plot has some depth with a grieving mom and hurting family. But the youngest of the group doesn't find out the truth until she discover's her sister's story for herself.,1
1316,"meh; this was an alright watch, but I wasn't really impressed with anything. there are some pretty good scenes, but after you figure out the reason for everything it's really just quite stupid. the mom is infuriating. i wouldn't recommend this one.",0
1317,"I should've watched this one sooner. Then again, I would'nt have had the great pleasure of seeing it tonight. What an impressive piece of writing and directing by Dominik Moll. The screenplay by Moll, along with Gilles Marchand and Colin Neil, is an intricate tightrope to walk, with its convoluted connections of characters, time, and actions. It's a film about the dangers of deception and infidelities, of the desperation that poverty and desires can push us into, and those who are hurt in the crossfire. 
Moll keeps things tight and flowing with an incredibly deft skill in pacing and well-realized characters . We come to know each of the main figures just well enough that we feel the authenticity of their emotional reactions and can appreciate the actions they take out of their desperate straits; out their perception of those they are using or those they desire most. But no one is safe in ""Only the Animals"". The victims and the victimizers are hurting, but their efforts to relieve that pain are misguided, or outright criminal. But sense when does clouded judgement or impulsive emotional reaction lead us to rational, mature actions?
The acting is superior in general. Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Laure Calamu. Denis Menochet, and Nadia Tereszkiewic are especially good. And Damien Bonnard is convincing as a man in his own arrested development; frozen in a static state of loss and isolation.
The Robbe-Grillet-esque manner in which the characters are so intertwined like some network of actions and reactions, continually surprises and explains when/why/how what we've seen already went down. One choice, one sudden impulse, one calculated act triggers another, with unfortunate results and no happy resolutions. 
Damn nice work, Moll, writers, and cast. 3.8 stars",1
1318,"Incredibly well written!!! I watched it because appeared listed in the best thrillers section of the golden tomatoes 2021, it was the last one but at least for me is the best one in the list, Titane and Azor were good and interesting but this one is soooo good! If you are a thriller junkie you''ll love this film!!!",1
1319,"Riveting French film which centres around a woman who has gone missing and explores the stories of the five people linked to her disappearance.  
Really well written and acted by the ensemble cast. 
Engaging from the start with some genuine surprises mixed into the story.  
Well worth checking out.",1
1320,"The best film I've seen for 2021, hands down. Well scripted and acted, a touch of Cohen Bros, a taste of irony and some suspense thrown in. Well done. And granted, it didn't take a whole lot to be the best movie of 2021 (I know it's from 2020 but I just saw it so it's new to me) but leave it to a French film to kick the butts of the mindless, copy cat Americans who seem wholly committed to just making the same film over and over for 5 decades in every genre. Script on this is solid, acting was super good. They didn't feel obligated to jam in hyper cool music to appease the hipsters, didn't need big name celebrities or any kind of crazy special effects. Just a talented writer, talented director, a great script and some talented actors. That's all it takes, Hollywood. Remember back when you used to follow the same formula back before you just started making lowest common denominator drivel with zero creativity or originality? Americans, take note. This is how you make a solid film.",1
1321,The best film ever saw. Everything ties in and works together so perfectly.,1
1322,So pleased to find this gem of a movie. So good on so many levels. Highly recommended.,1

1324,"Fascinating and artfully crafted documentary which has left an indelible mark on me. I will permanently see the world differently because of this film. The connections between the history of photography and guns, the Axon footage and its influence, and how pervasive it all is today. Loved it!",1
1325,"A masterful smorgasbord of phenomenology, human biases, police technology and the act of recording. The presentation is slick and smooth, allowing the audience to easily comprehend the numerous concepts and explorations that the director tackles. The score by Dan Deacon is amazing and adds to the artful nature of the documentary.",1
1326,"A well constructed and interesting documentary spoilt by inexperienced, borderline unprofessional camerawork.",1
1327,"Interesting aspects, but very disjointed. Written ""narration"" portions were odd and poorly done.
Too much time on axon body cams. Other portions poorly edited which wasted lots of time.
Overall, probably not worth it and can get better evaluation of these topics in 15min on a show like 60 minutes, instead of 2 hours spent on this documentary….",0
1328,"All Light, Everywhere is the second documentary feature film from Theo Anthony, but it is muddled despite being informative.  Anthony takes a both sides approach, but too many subplots confuse the story.  When the film is focused on how the cameras effect police officers and the people whom the police interact it's best.  Then in the epilogue the filmmaker shows scenes that were cut and says this was a big part of the film until it wasn't.  Yikes.  Anthony the director needs to fire Anthony the editor and go back and take another pass at his footage with somebody else!  Final Score: 4/10",0
1329,"This so called film is an insult!
Not much more than a promotional ad for Axon (former Taser company)!
Rotten Tomatoes critics should be ashamed of themselves for pumping this garbage with good reviews like they have been with others since covid, trying to get more viewers out to the movies in my humble opinion!",0
1330,"While they covered some interesting material, it was a bit of an in cohesive mess.  It seemed that they were trying so hard to make an ""artistic film"" that they sacrificed actually going anywhere.  We almost left during it a few times, but kept hoping it was going to come to some real point or conclusions.  Other than esoteric statements, it never did.",0
1331,A metamodernist philosophical documentary where the camera's blind spot is revealed for questioning.,1
1332,The term galaxy brain was invented for this movie.,1
1333,"A refreshingly unique take on surveillance in our communities. Part art, part story, this film captivates and leaves a lasting impression.",1
1334,Very interesting view of the youth of the reich and how they watched and where indoctrinated into the Nazi way. Very good would like to have known if the interviewer asked the same questions to each person.,1
1335,Brutally hard to watch knowing the history this documentary recounts. I knew it would probably have subtitles as all of the interviewees were Germans who were of late teens to adult age by 1938-39 and were participants in various German institutions of the German military or in support of the German war effort. They were asked questions about their history and experiences and what they thought both at the time and with all these years to reflect on that history. It exposes how easily some average citizens can be encouraged and/or manipulated into believing and doing things they wouldn't have done under normal circumstances. Has some relevance to the manipulation of our citizenry today through the internet.,1
1336,Interesting interview of Germans who observed and participated in Germany during WW11 of Hitler's reign of terror.,1
1337,Very interesting documentary told from the German perspective. The only issue was that it jumped from person to person and then back again.  It wasn't a smooth transition from person to person.  Great to hear from actual men and women who were active in the Nazi party and propaganda machine.,1
1338,"Clearly a great deal of consideration went into the making of this film.  The responses, some of which are chilling, are placed in context.  Most of the participants were children growing up in Nazi Germany, and clearly fell under Hitlers sway.  One former SS member movingly acknowledged shame when presenting to young skinheads.  A movie not to be missed.",1
1339,"Very sobering. The movie really delved into how and why young people got brainwashed into following Hitler and rationalized the atrocities they committed, some even defending what they did.",1
1340,very powerful hearing first hand accounts.,1
1341,Superb movie. Should be mandatory viewing. Lots to think about snd talk about after. Eye opening,1
1342,"A very poignant review of attitudes around the Holocaust in WW2, from the point of view of German citizens and soldiers alive during the war.  Perhaps I should not have been surprised, but I was: many Germans struggle to accept responsibility for what happened, and some deny it completely.  Its an important lesson that we are responsible for the acts of our governments.",1
1343,Very informative and interesting from direct survivors of the era!,1
1344,"Enjoyed the visual play, but not main characters normalcy when in fact, they were no such thing.  Communication & good mental health would be the best environment for retired & the young.  Pleased to see proud females.",0
1345,"This had nothing to do with the Villages.  It's about three odd but boring, people.",0
1346,"The images, the light, the atmosphere, and the pace of this film is dead on accurate. Having spent time around older people, retied people, and others in Florida (I happen to be almost 73), I found this film to accurately convey the illusionary fiction of 55+ communities down there. Indeed, I hope the filmmaker goes back to the Villages ten years from now, when the dancing, golf, and drinks by the pool, are replaced with wheelchairs, walkers, and oxygen canisters. From my experiences, cultural pleasure environments are great, but like all things - they are temporary. The Villages are a time bomb, and it's ticking. I'd like the director to do a third film, showing seniors who continue to live vital, creative, and challenging lives. Believe me, we're out here, and we have no interest in second childhoods.",1
1347,Found some great real life characters in an interesting place.,1
1348,"This was horrible. Boring, depressing, one-sided. They chose some of the weirdest people to follow. Like a guy who didn't even live in The Villages and a drug addict.",0
1349,"Outstanding documentary about one of the creepiest communities in the United States. And yes, of course it's the Villages in Florida.",1
1350,Well edited and shot but found it a bit depressing. It appears to show one side of this community. Not sure it is representive of some of the newer sections and recent people who have moved to this area?,0
1351,"This is the feature film debut of Lance Oppenheim and it's pretty good, and quite sad.  What we learn is happiness isn't forever and to cherish the ones you love, among maybe 100 other things.  Oppenheim, filmed this in his early 20s, which bodes well for the future of the Harvard grad.   We follow four people and several others are passers by.  One of the four is a con-artist/pathological liar.  Another is one heavy drugs and isn't in the reality based world.  Seems like boomer paradise.  Like anyplace one chooses to live, life is what you make of it.  Unhappy people will never be able to find happiness in anything else long term unless they first the find happiness in themselves.  It's a well-made film and at only 83 minutes is a breeze. Final Score: 6.5/10",1
1352,"The best moments are when Oppenheim narrows in on these almost Lynchian sequences (the acting teacher's speech to the class, the group of women all named Elaine, etc.) which given the fact that this is a documentary emphasizes the phony façade of The Villages in much better ways than a group of taking heads every could.",1
1353,It's interesting and touching. Somewhat depressing. Generally a 6.8/10. I prefer a 10-scale rating. Feels more accurate.,1
1354,Started off with intrigue but sort of sputtered off into family drama.  Visually appealing and interesting characters.,1
1355,"HOME RENOVATION
Getting right to the point, the film opens with a tense bedroom scene as a man shakingly points a gun at a sleeping couple. How all this came to be is not fully explored, there is no tidy backstory. Shit is happening, and it may not stop.

Shot in a claustrophobic 4:3 aspect ratio which renders the colourless dustbowl expanses into small town landscapes of no escape, exasperated by long and tight pickup truck cab shots. A very effective aesthetic. Though presented as a young family struggling through a trial separation, we only see the events through David: his love, his confusion, his despair, his denial, his mistakes. Clayne Crawford is excellent in the role, adopting a fragile and vulnerable bravado facade as he valiantly and clumsily fights to regain his family, and some semblance of normalcy without really understanding what is going on.

He is cordial, southernly mannered, respectful of his elders and overtly sweet to his kids, yet quick to temper and prone to missteps. He is easy to like, easy to hate, and easy to sympathize with. The rock on the bottom is coming into focus.

In what is otherwise a gripping drama, there lurks the lack of development of everyone in David's immediate circle, especially his wife. This plot restraint may not feel satisfactory, but it does reinforce the fact that everything revolves around David, for good or bad.

Besides the bleak and cramped cinematography, ""The Killing of Two Lovers"" ramps up the tension with an insistent, rumbling, percussive soundtrack punctuated by twig snaps and door slams. Audioscapes found mostly in the horror genre. It's as if the movie is breathing, has a life of its own, or perhaps burning. Quite disconcerting.

This is all about what's going on in David's head, which is a dark, noisy, hazy ball of confusion. Whatever happens, it is evident that it will not be great.

Real life can be brutal at the best of times, but it is relationships that suffer, and even though there are a bevy of multiple choice answers, none of then are easy, or any good for that matter. A film that sticks around long after the credits have rolled to black.

- hipCRANK",1
1356,Deeply moving movie. Must Watch!,1
1357,"What a waste of time. I'm a big fan of slow-moving, dialogue-heave, indie films. This one did absolutely nothing for me. Zero plot. Mediocre acting. And super annoying soundtrack that included doors creaking and slamming. You know it's going to be esoteric garbage when it gets a super high RT rating. Avoid this one like the plague!",0
1358,"Simple and thoughtful, this one takes a realistic approach to marriage, separation and everything in between. Well acted and well shot too.",1
1359,"If you are reading these reviews and are confused by the 5 star/1 star dichotomy I can explain it this way: if you are under 35, and got the impression from the title this was going to be a crime thriller... sorry, that's not what this is and you will likely find it slow and boring. The audience for this film needs a lot of years of emotional life experience to appreciate what's unfolding here. Those folks are more likely to be deeply moved by the quiet, authentic portrait of a man struggling in an internal cage fight for self control in the face of losing his his wife and family. An incredibly powerful performance by Crawford, who masterfully conveys all this man's love, confusion, longing, hope, humiliation, rage and vulnerability simmering just under the surface.",1
1360,"Taking in the rustic sparseness of rural Utah is a bonus to enduring a heavily suspenseful, unusually scored, and unflinching look at a divorcing family.",1
1361,"A film that opens as one thing and closes as something entirely different, The Killing of Two Lovers is a masterpiece film that examines strained relationships in a small town and the dynamics within. A premise that has the potential for melodrama or over-the-top bombastics, the film is a surprisingly small, quiet movie that favors character beats over grandiose plot. David, recently separated from his wife and kids and living at home with his father a mere mile or so away, opens the film with a scene that immediately draws the audience into the film, standing over his wife and her new boyfriend sleeping in his house. From there we follow David grappling with his feelings while jobbing for work around town. The uncomfortable moments spent with his wife are stretched out, giving the viewers a secondhand embarrassment and ache for David as he continually fails to connect with Nikki.

The most fully realized moments with this tortured man are when he's with his 4 kids. The scenes in which he interacts with his 3 boys and navigates his brooding older daughter are some of the highlights of the movie; despite fighting his darkest intentions, David is an incredibly loving father. Whether its sneaking over to the house to tell his boys a joke at 2am or setting off rockets with them in the park, David's joy at hanging out with his children are the only bright scenes in the film. The fact that these bright scenes are usually bracketed by darkness (stalking the boyfriend or using a mannequin for target practice with his pistol) serve to remind the audience that while he seems a dutiful father, he's also a man that needs to seek some serious therapy. Because the focus is set on David, his complexities are on full display, which unintentionally does a disservice to Nikki, as we never get a peek into her point of view.

Starring Clayne Crawford and Sepideh Moafi, the cast (much like the rest of the film) is minimal, choosing to keep a narrow focus on this struggling family in a small town. Crawford is an emotional whirlwind, oscillating between moods at a moment's notice as he interacts with his estranged family, father, and townspeople. Despair and rage are at the forefront for the majority of the film and Crawford handles both masterfully while managing to not give an overly embellished performance. A testament to both good writing and good acting, Crawford's David is incredibly likeable, sympathetic, and his struggle easy to identify with. Conversely, Sepideh Moafi, as David's wife Nikki, may seem like an antagonist to David but in reality is her own fleshed out character with different wants and needs that run perpendicular to David's. The friction between be the two characters make for the highlights of the film, with Crawford and Moafi flexing their talents to yell, needle, and undermine each other in the unhealthiest of ways. With only a handful of minutes on the screen, Chris Coy does an incredible job as Derek, the interloper between David and Nikki as Nikki's new boyfriend. Of the two scenes where David and Derek interact, the second one is the explosive confrontation that viewers have spent the movie waiting for yet still manages to surprise and eschew expectations.

Produced, written, directed, and edited by Robert Machoian, The Killing of Two Lovers is a stark, minimalistic affair, mostly set at two houses, one convenience store, and at a handful of crossroads, both literal and metaphorically. The low budget is bolstered by the strength of the script, the acting, and the directing choices made by Machoian. The decision to let shots linger or stretch past a comfortable limit is purposeful as Machoian lets Crawford do the lifting as David struggles with whether or not he wants to takes the lives of his wife and her boyfriend. Another highlight of the film is the delightfully odd sound mix that accompanies the score. Machoian uses sound to help ratchet the tension of the film, weaving in certain sounds that are both instantly recognizable and unfamiliar to keep the audience off their toes. The cocking of a pistol or the turning of an engine are sprinkled in at times to represent what's going through David's mind as he attempting to cope with the separation. At a scant 84 minutes, the pacing is slow, almost laconic at times, but never fails to keep the viewer's attention.

Overall, The Killing of Two Lovers is a wonderful film that deserves every accolade its received thus far. A story about learning how to cope with change, navigating new and unfamiliar circumstances, and fighting to keep ones family unit together, it's a wonderful character piece that shines brightest when Crawford and Moafi interact at cross purposes. A slow burn of a film, the will he/won't he looms over the story as David's internal struggle is put on display. Machoian manages to portray the complexities and nuances of a failing relationship set against the backdrop of rural town in middle America with a technical precision that is both beautiful and heartbreaking to behold. A strong script, strong performances, and a steady hand behind the the camera make this one of the best films of the year thus far.",1
1362,"This is that movie where the smarmy, not all films have to be full of explosions  and superheros tossers will will pipe in and explain that this is a quiet masterpiece and commentary on small town living and the day to day struggle of the poor and the limitations of marrying too young. Now I don't mind a bit of silence when anything worthwhile is said when people open their mouths. I am however interested in that washing machine that sends    text when it's done. ""The Killing of Two Lovers""  - such a self important title. The director think he's Cassevetes? When the most interesting point of discussion is the endlessly irritating sound I think that pretty much covers the value of this drudgery. But, bring an optimist, I like to think I learn something from every movie, no matter how pointless. Never visit Kanosch, Utah - it's a dump and nobody can act,",0
1363,"Agh intensity intensifying.

A misleading first shot summed up the desperation, intensity, and anger that I felt during this movie. The shot deceptively told audiences what the movie's title was referring to. However, after watching the movie, it's clear what the killing was actually about.

It's like Marriage Story but with A24 vibes. The cinematography and harrowing music made me felt like I was watching a slow-burn horror. For David, the main character who helplessly tried to save his marriage, it's indeed a horror of sort. The movie is also like Shiva Baby, as both cleverly and effectively create an intense horror out of a seemingly non-horror topic.

The last 10 minutes was absolutely nail-biting because I could feel something bad would happen. 

Overall, it's desperate but beautiful. 8.5-9/10",1
1364,"A rare documentary. Glaringly honest, sad and triumphant. A true glimpse into an artist's life and art.",1
1365,Very heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same toile. Loved it.,1
1366,I found this very moving.  Such an honest look at his own life.  I admire him for sharing this with us all.,1
1367,"I have to admit, I was not expecting Val Kilmer to be quite as into turqouise jewelry as he turned out to be. 

There's a few manufactured moments, sure, but Val benefits tremendously from a shocking amount of archival and behind-the-scenes footage that has been maintained and collected over an entire lifetime. Taken together, it gives us answers to some questions but poses even more about the actor's personality; we see plenty of details of home life, success, and tragedy, but also peek at a rather bizarre personality that isn't really evident in his on-screen persona. There's a sense of spontaneity and playfulness that is paired alongside some deep-seated trauma, and the result of that particular cocktail of personal development is an individual that is equal parts creative, spiritual, and humorous (the latter coming across as a bit of a coping mechanism). 

The film coasts on a bit of a nostalgia, offering a revolving door of previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage of some major blockbusters of the '80s and '90s, but also has a surprisingly introspective side, including Kilmer wrestling with his current medical status that largely prevents him from going after new roles, and in particular the ramifications of ""cashing in on who he used to be"" with convention and festival appearances. More of a well-detailed biography than a probing dissection of character, but still an interesting documentary that makes Kilmer seem like much more than a once-famous A-lister.

Probably the greatest sin that the film commits is how little time it dedicates to Heat. (3/5)",0

1371,"An amazing tribute and insight into a great actor's life and how he was affected by family, friends, fellow actors and illness.  It is a really moving piece that showed what it takes to be a good actor and a good person.  The home movies reminded me of my childhood.  Kilmer had such an interesting life, filled with hardships and success, it made me appreciate his work and other actors like him.  It plan on looking up his ""Citizen Twain"" performance.  It was on Amazon.",1
1372,"Raw, emotional and truth.  Life can have a unfair sense of humor. No one is immune.",1
1373,"Raw, sometimes chaotic home movie footage, some insight on his personality, but nothing too deeply personal.  No interviews from those close to him as he lets you know what he wants you to know himself. If you are a Val Kilmer fan, which I am, you will appreciate this movie which I found very interesting, sad moments, a little heartbreaking,  kind of  sweet.  He is a great artist, an eccentric, somewhat immature and/or obstinate, An incorrigible clown at times - often described as ""difficult to work with"" - maybe so.  Nevertheless a great artist.  Clearly he was destined to be an actor from a young age and was blessed with beauty and many wonderful talents.  He has survived incredible loss, some negative situations brought on himself as he described as ""behaved badly"" at times.  He is through it all an interesting man, a  good man who I would love to know better. I wish he had made more movies when he was healthy. Cancer has robbed us of this great talent.",1

I liked the movie because it really shows you how hard can it be to leave everything you know behind and try to arrive to a new place, where you have to speak a new language, where you have to acclimate yourself to the weather and where the most difficult part is fitting into a new community while meeting their rules and their legal requirements.

Also, wish the supporting cast had more dialogue, understand the quietness sets the mood of isolation but there times where filling that void with banter or their past or thoughts would've given the audience a way to compare with Omar. Liked, Omar was center stage, we got to meet his older brother. That he emoted even without words, that he was conflicted with whether he made the right decision, we finally got to see that through his interaction with his Parents in Istanbul and Elder Brother. A movie to eventually add to my collection, FOR SURE.",1

As I was watching it, I remembered some important work to do but its radiancy was such that I just couldn't leave it. The main character's persona spiraling down into a delusionary state was both unnerving and devastating to watch. This movie clearly brings out the horrors of being alone and the frantic attempt to find a meaning for their life. How religiously delirious one can become just to garner some attention and lead a life with supposed ""meaning"" can be seen in a frightening way through this film. Humans are social animals and if left alone, their own power of imagination and consciousness can turn up against them. This movie brings out the pain of people suffering from PTSD and how they dearly need one's support. The movie is perfectly directed and edited with some really powerful scenes. I am just glad that I watched it.",1

1406,Its a film meant to be seen on the big screen. Im so glad I made the time.,1
1407,Hands down the best movie of the past year.   Everything is nuanced and the performances are all Oscar worthy.  This is a movie about toxic masculinity and repression and its psychological effects.  It is also a story about family loyalty and how it eventuality manifests itself - stick with it!  Anyone posting a review before they have watched this powerful movie to the end is doing it a gave disservice.,1

1424,"This film is very much arty, quirky and surreal and yet it works quite well. Its hard to explain properly but I felt it was really quite poignant by the end. Its partly about trust, dreams and secrets. There are one or two amusing moments, such as one with the main character, a masseur, working on a dog on his massage table. I'd recommend this film, yes.",1
1425,"Interesting film, I enjoyed it more than most other virtual movies the past year.",1
1426,Magical. They don't make movies like this one anymore.,1
1427,A true story of a superhero who delves into improving the lives of environments. An almost surrealism that must be considered as a true masterpiece,1
1428,"This movie should have been much better than it was.  The theme of a masseur witnessing lives in a wealthy neighborhood is very promising,  and these scenes were very well done.  However,  the movie then seemed unwilling to pursue it seriously, instead opting for sentimentality and a silly magical realism that was incoherent even by the standards of that genre.  In the end, it was childish and unserious.",0
1429,"When an enigmatic massage therapist/hypnotist from the Chernobyl area of Ukraine shows up in an upscale Polish gated community, he miraculously attends to the healing of an assortment of residents with varying physical and emotional needs. But who is he really, especially in light of his special powers that make him seem like a subdued but otherworldly superhero? That's the gist of this atmospheric tale from directors Malgorzata Szumowska and Michal Englert, which seamlessly weaves drama, science fiction and delightful humor in a modestly intriguing story, thanks in large part to the fine lead performance of Alec Utgoff. However, despite an engaging premise, captivating back story and colorful supporting characters, the film's deliberate ambiguity gets stretched quite thin after a while, leaving viewers wonder exactly where this film is going, with a concluding payoff that's somewhat less than satisfying. As a vehicle that seems quite self-satisfied with itself for its beautifully filmed but nevertheless cryptic nature, the filmmakers have left the audience somewhat in the dark with some of their meandering, underdeveloped and unexplained narrative choices. The result is a film that probably should have gone through an additional round of script changes and final edits before being released, alterations that would have made for a much more satisfying picture.",0

1437,Old Henry is a decent film. It is about a farmer who takes in an injured man with a satchel of cash. Tim Blake Nelson and Scott Haze give good performances. The script is a little slow in places. Potsy Ponciroli did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the action and drama.,1
1438,An old farmer with a mysterious past gets himself and his son in a whirlwind of trouble when he decides to help a dying man who is either a sheriff or an outlaw. A true classic western for the modern era.,1

1440,"I wanted to give this film a chance because of the rave reviews by critics. But this was awful. The fact that it wasn't a typical narrative film and just a series of vignettes didn't bother me. It's just that almost all of the vignettes are pointless. They elicit no emotion in the viewer except, ""Why am I watching this?"" To me it's just lazy filmmaking. I have no script, I have no dialogue, I have no story, so I'll just put images together to create ""poignancy"". But it doesn't work. There wasn't one scene that mattered to me. This film isn't beautiful or sad or memorable, it's just empty. And the historical scenes? Why are they even there?  I never write reviews online, but I wanted to spare others from getting stuck watching this. I've probably seen thousands of films in my life, and this is one of the five worst films I have ever seen. It's pointless. Don't watch.",0
1441,"Painfull, but hillarious. Like life...",1
1442,I didn't get it.  I don't get Roy Anderson and bully to those who do.  It does contain a funny moment or two and is mostly easy on the eyes (and ears).  Not much dialogue.  Final Score: 3/10,0
1443,"I am not stranger to this peculiar director, and I always liked his films and style. But ""About Endlessness"" was a bit of a letdown for me. The gorgeous picture-like scenes and the existential poetry is there like always, but I felt there was no effort in the writing. Laughters and absurdity was an important part of the earlier works, but I found nothing of the sort in here.",0
1444,"Watching this movie reminded me of seeing the three successive Terrence Malick films where he used very little dialogue, often none, but let images drive the movies. The often lush, lingering shots of beautiful people in beautiful homes or amid natural settings were powerful in the first two films, but grew subsequently less so. 
The drop off in overall cinematic quality was obvious, especially by the third. Some of that may have been me as a viewer tiring of this approach by Malick, but it was also a case of style over substance, as the first film was a more cohesive, fully-realized film; fresh, innovative, enthralling.
The second used much the same formula to strong effect at times, but it simply was not as strong in its innate story line or overall concept.
The first Roy Andersson film I saw, ""Songs From the Second Floor"", knocked me out with the almost collage-style approach he took. The film mixed film with stage and a painter's mentality; blending captured moments with slow moving action, as if a painting was alive for a brief time. ""You, the Living"" did much the same to at least equal if not greater effect. Yet, the last two films have failed to bring about such profound reactions from me. It may be time for Andersson to change it up some. This one rang a bit hollow for me. 3.2 stars",0
1445,"Maybe it was above my head, but I just couldn't get into this. Very boring. Turned it off after 25 minutes.",0
1446,At the beginning of this parade of shots/scenes I was really bored and unconvinced but through the end I wished it had gone on forever.,1
1447,"This is a surreal, rather experimental movie. There is no cohesive story, but elements of several. Don't expect one.
It is starkly beautiful, slow, ponderous. Sort of like walking through a gallery of darkly done art that you can't not look at. David Lynch without dialogue or violence.
This isn't a conventional movie so don't come expecting one.",1
1448,"About Endlessness is definitely a strange experience. This is my first Roy Andersson film, and I’ve gotta say I’m mixed on his style. I appreciate the imagery and I thought the music was good as well. But the film felt dull and repetitive at parts. The film is only 78 minutes, but it feels much longer. The static camera and the vignettes that repeat the same themes over and over did nothing to make things exciting. However, I do see how people can get something out of this. I just didn’t. Overall, this wasn’t for me. It could be for you, but this just wasn’t my thing. ",0
1449,"About Endlessness is a beautiful meditation on life and existence. A contemplative film that is both surreal and also realistic. A unique film of shared emotions and strange currencies. Swedish director Roy Andersson has created a film that confounds and yet also inspires. It's an anthology film, a film of many short scenes, most unrelated except in their unyielding humanity. At a brisk 80 minutes it's a film of immense beauty and thought. Most scenes start with the narrator whispering 'I saw a man/woman' before describing that scene. There is a woman in her office, a priest comtemplating his life, a man regretting his past actions, people on a bus. Scenes come and go but they all carry a certain weight. Settings are devoid of colour, most are beige or grey. It's a quiet film that overflows with intimacy and intricacy. It can be absurd and also sad. A unique film that offers plenty in the field of human experience.",1

1456,"This is a really touching film about a relative suddenly having to take on his siblings young child and the ability of people to talk about their worries, feelings etc. It's kind of hard to describe but I thought it was quite touching and poigant and Joaquin Phoenix gives a great lead performance, alongside the child played by Woody Norman. It's lovely seeing the two get along together, share some funny moments etc. Yes its sentimental I suppose but not in an overly glossy and cheap/tacky sort of a way. I very much enjoyed it and I'd happily recommend it to others. I think, if anything, its more powerful due to the fact its shot in black and white - that gives it somewhat of a timeless feel and I really liked how the main character, Johnny, is shown interviewing people as part of his job as a radio journalist, seeing him encourage others to open up and speak out about their personal truths etc. I also quite enjoyed the light music played subtley in the background.",1
1457,"A meandering, somewhat touching film about a child and his effect on some people..",0
1458,"Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix), a radio personality traveling the country interviewing children regarding their views on life, helps his sister through a family crisis by taking her precocious young son Jesse (Woody Norman) off her hands for a few days while she deals with matters.  During their time together in Los Angeles, New York, and New Orleans, they develop an unexpected bond that helps them both come to the understanding that life is not always what it appears.  Bolstered by beautiful black and white cinematography, strong performances from a subdued Phoenix and boisterous Norman, and confident direction from Mike Mills, C'Mon C'Mon is an insightful examination of the relationships that can exist between adults and children.  While it does come across as too talky at times (the stunning visuals often express more than the dialogue), it remains refreshingly original, typical of Mills' oeuvre to date.",1
1459,"Beautifully shot, ""c'mon c'mon"" is a little pretentious yet well acted by Phoenix. But if you really listen, it's a bunch of hogwashy platitudes that will lead to that poor boy leading a miserable life.",0

1466,Very good. Funny. Heartfelt. See it.,1
1467,"A good concept that is superbly executed. I like that the family's disability makes for rich character conflict while never making anyone the bad guy. The way deaf people are portrayed feels sincere (which it is) and even quite educational. For such a potentially bleak premise Coda is both very funny and heartwarming. The performances are great across the board, and I think Emilia Jones steps up and really helms the movie, which is super impressive considering all that the different aspects the role entails.

His Presidency was marred by problems and has not been viewed in the eye of political history as a successful one.  This movie looks at Carter and his Presidency through the lens of Gospel and Rock N' Roll.  Through looking at the his musical influences and his love of artists like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Mahalia Jackson, and Greg Allman the film gives a good look at the ""soul"" of President Carter.   This one is a well made documentary.   Good interviews, with musicians, family, and the man himself.   Terrific news and historic footage from Carter's political ascension in Georgia and beyond.    The film does a good job of looking at Carter's life against the backdrop of racial segregation and prejudice Carter grew up and succeeded against.  This one is worthwhile for history buffs, musics buffs, and documentary buffs.   I liked it a lot.",1
1485,"I loved this documentary. It's great! He was the President in my college years and the first I voted for. That being said, I was unaware of most of the story, even though I knew almost everyone involved. The variety of musicians from every music genre surprised me from Johnny Cash, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Simon, Aretha, the Allmans to Bono, Loretta Lynn, Jimmy Buffet and more. What a contrast of integrity and compassion between the 39th & 46th POTUS. He may not have been the best President, but IMHO, he's the best person who was President.",1

Our greatest President and perhaps our greatest human being. A wonderful documentary detailing life before being liberal became an ironically negative word. Thank you CNN films.",1

To see a president who really cared about our country and our culture, and who you could trust to tell the truth was like a breath of fresh air.

And the background score was perfect.  Cudo's to director Mary Wharton and to her whole crew!",1

1491,Such a thrilling and gripping tale of survival amidst political turmoil. Each second will keep you on the edge of your seat.,1
1492,As an African I hated it. Anyone who watched it knows it does not look good for Africa and cements the stereotypes we are trying to fight to encourage foreign investments in Africa and its subsequent development.. When the minister of foreign affairs calls the embassy the ambassador uses a fan and paper to mimic generator noises to get out of the conversation then they laugh claiming there are some advantage to being in Africa. Insulting and condescending but I guess that's entertaining to the rest of the world.,0

Please do your research, none of the African actors look like Somalians, who have distinctive features. This is so insulting, just because you made some money by enslaving your working-class in sweatshops does not mean that you become partially white.",0
1497,"Escape From Mogadishu is South Korea's Argo.  Director Ryoo Seung-wan has masterfully told the dramatic story of the 1990 revolution in Somalia and the impact of the Diplomatic missions of North and South Korea.  This Well Go USA release is based upon a series of real events that brought the rival diplomats of a formerly unified country together to save the lives of their women and children through a daring escape.

The film is set in 1990 Somalia as the South Korean government is attempting to garner the essential support of African nations for its bid to become a member of the United Nations.  This task was made significantly more challenging due to the concerted efforts of the North Korean government  to persuade African nations to block their entry.  

Amidst all of the political wrangling between the two countries a brutal civil war breaks out in Somalia, endangering the lives of the diplomats of every nation that maintained a Diplomatic presence there.     Black Hawk Down (2001), an American made, award winning film covered a later chapter of the same conflict, and its impact on the American Soldiers there.  

The heart and strength of the film surrounds the need of the diplomats of the two separated Koreas to join forces to Escape from Mogadishu, Somalia's Capital city.  In this effort, through the brilliant Directing, award worthy acting, and visually gripping cinematography we are immersed in the conflict between a deep seeded mistrust of two nations and the desire of individual human beings to protect their loved ones and fellow citizens.  I am not sure how much of the details are true, but the film really shines a light on how easy it is to forget the problems between nations are just that, and even at the highest level of diplomacy, that without our humanity we are lost.

Escape from Mogadishu (2021) is as good a film as you will see this year.  There is no shortage of action, nail biting drama, and emotionally gripping moments in this laudable film.  While not set in the Shah deposed Iran of the 1970's, this film still reminded me of Argo, the 2021 Oscar winning Best Picture.  Both were based on historically dramatic incidents where the filmmakers adeptly told their compelling stories through the experiences of the diplomatic survivors of these respective incidents.  Both films are equally Oscar worthy.

Sadly, the film also painfully reminded me of the recent chaos in Kabul as diplomats and citizens attempted to flee Afghanistan, in the midst of its own regime toppling.  While the images were starkly similar, the film was made well before the incidents of earlier this Summer; which, somehow, made its accuracy more shocking.

Kim Yoon-seok and Huh Joon-ho play the Somali ambassadors from South and North Korea, respectively.  Their ability to convey the fear and mistrust the people of a, once united, country feel towards each other with subtlety and humanity is pivotal to the film's emotional depth.  While this film is an action film about Somalia, it is more profoundly a film about the sad divide along the Korean Penninsula.

The entire ensemble cast of this film is praiseworthy; whether playing the North and South Korean Diplomats and their families, the Somalia government soldiers, or the key rebel soldiers.  All are in top form and immerse the viewer in a world of chaos, fear , and confusion that is unmatched  by the majority of films of the past decade.  This entire is a first rate cast.

Escape from Mgadishu is subtitled.

For Taekwondo enthusiasts look out for a key fight scene as the movie kicks into high gear.",1
1498,This movie was so good. I'd watch it again. Best movie I watched this year.,1

Kenya to this have refugees in a huge camp which gets raided by warlords. child warriors are a real thing most are drugged.",1
1501,"Amalia Ulman  wrote, produced, and directed 'El Planeta, which stars herself and her mother in the latter's debut performance on the silver screen.  The film is set in Spain and is mostly in Spanish.  I hated this.  It's pretentious and I found zero reason to root for anyone.  It is very artsy and minimalist and is stretched to 81 minutes and felt like it was over two hours.  The idea of staying in the middle without a clear point of view makes the picture feel bleak.  If that's the idea, then bully for Ulman.  I wish she gets more hopeful for her next feature and maybe she can have something to say that isn't blah.  Final Score: 2/10",0
1502,"The Real Charlie Chaplin is an earnest attempt to characterize the legendary silent film star Charlie Chaplin, showing more about the man behind the Little Tramp character, and explaining his significance. At times this documentary's somewhat bland narration and spotty coverage of Chaplin's life seem to undermine the actor and his legacy.

Almost everyone knows who Charlie Chaplin is, at least by his image:  The bowler hat, scraggly coat, thin cane, and trademark mustache are well-known symbols of the first landmark actor of Western cinema. The Real Charlie Chaplin does its best to do the impossible — capture the essence of Charlie Chaplin — using archival footage and tape-recorded interviews.  It's a compilation of perspectives and personal impressions, told in dramatic fashion, rather than a linear storyline. Really, The Real Charlie Chaplin is all about Chaplin's rise and fall to and from fame, his political opinions, and his contributions to film history (which have been surveyed in a slightly haphazard fashion, only grazing the surface of some of Chaplin's works). 

The film draws on rarely-heard recordings made by Chaplin, his family, and Effie Wisdom, a childhood friend who grew up with him in London. It's surreal to hear all these voices talk about one of history's most-loved personalities. Directors Charles Middleton and James Spinney orchestrated reenactments of these recordings, with actors lip-synching and emoting precisely to the audio. It's an approach that works for some and may not for others, since it entails actors adding gestures or expressions that the original speakers weren't able to, and so feels a bit unnatural at times. Wisdom's recording is by far the clearest, and this reenactment method begins to fall apart when Chaplin's recording is introduced, as Chaplin's voice is grainy and the tape recorder makes him sound strained. Many scenes of Chaplin's films are dissected by narrator Pearl Mackie, as is his family life through a series of photographs accompanied by the aforementioned recordings. Her narration slows the pace of the film quite dramatically, and it may have been a better idea to have the recordings guide the film more, instead of the narration. In all other aspects, though, The Real Charlie Chaplin is a well-made film.

The Real Charlie Chaplin is all about individualism, perspective, and devoting yourself to your craft. There are some mature themes like domestic abuse and manipulation to watch out for.
 
I give The Real Charlie Chaplin 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. The Real Charlie Chaplin begins its theatrical run at Cinema Village (New York) and Laemmle Santa Monica (Los Angeles) on Friday, November 19, 2021.

1503,It was very nice to see Charlie Chaplin in the cinema - where he's meant to be. It also did a comprehensive overview of an iconic individual without being particularly judgemental or conclusive. But I didn't learn anything new and it had a very slow and repetitive start.,0
1504,"I dislike movies that quit just as they seem to get to the point, which is that several more movies will need to be made to explain the first movie. Why did I spend an hour and 44 minutes of my life on something that doesn't know how to conclude in a timely fashion?
Full disclosure:  I do better with closed captioning; surely I missed some significant dialogue. That could explain why this flick was so confusing.
Lapsis did not satisfy my inner SciFi fan, because the SciFi was never mentioned (unless it was under someone's breath and I didn't hear it; see previous paragraph). According to the DVD packaging, mysterious aliens left an unknown number of metallic cubes about the size of a Porta-Potty, in various wooded areas, and if we Earthlings connect these cubes with cables and then eventually to our computers, we get superior computer performance. So laying miles of cable directly on the forest floor is the best way to connect these cubes?!
It's been said you show a story; you don't tell it. But when you show things that don't make sense, you could be trying too hard. Examples:  there's a man who sells holistic teas. He has a mysterious meeting that is not explained. There is a recurring theme of random house cats showing up from time to time. A father sees footage of his adult daughter breaking into his business and stealing from it. He has no reaction. We don't even know if he recognizes her. It's annoying things like this that make me feel this movie is a waste of time.",0
1505,"This is a somewhat mysterious, slightly sinister and definitely exploitative film, plot wise, not content wise, about the futuristic gig economy. Some aspects of it made me think of the Ken Loach film 'Sorry We Missed You' and others of 'The Lobster'.

It makes you think about the threat of digital technology superceding human capability. I wish we knew more about the main characters brother, who's suffering from 'Omnia'. That intrigued me more but it's not a fully fleshed out sub-plot. Shame. Its a quirky watch. It doesn't entirely 'work' I think but its ok. Perhaps more of an allegorical thought piece than anything else - it may seem a bit too bland and bizarre for some. Its quite sci-fi based, although without many special effects. A bit of a strange one, this. I wouldn't personally recommend it as a film as such, no.",0
1506,An interesting take on the gig economy and sheds light on how humans may try hard but will never be able to get rid of the grip that technology has over us.,1
1507,"An interesting and clever little drama/mystery with a sci-fi twist that makes some astute social commentary on big tech companies, the effect their technology has on the world, and the exploitation of the working class. Dean Imperial gives a fantastic central performance and nails his everyday-man character who's just trying his best to get by, but accidentally gets caught up in something much bigger than himself. ‘Lapsis' does lag a bit in the middle act where the momentum kinda stalls and there's not much new info being added, but overall it's absolutely a solid, enjoyable and inventive effort from writer/director Noah Hutton.",1

Ray Tincelli, skeptical of the new technology, is forced to obtain a shady permit and buy into it due to the increasingly unaffordable costs of his half brother's medical care.

A seemingly straightforward story of a man working hard to care for his family, the decision to interlace a mystery of who Lapsis is gives the movie depth and intrigue as Ray tries to work both problems at once. An obvious allegory for super companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart and their business practices as they pertain to how they treat their employees, Lapsis can be viewed as cautionary tale. The balance of power that begins to shift in the film could signal a herald in our own times due to the growing dissatisfaction of working conditions in America and abroad.

One of the strong suits of Lapsis is its lack of big name stars. To that end, Dean Imperial makes for a perfect lead in the film. As Ray, a man who's seemingly a step behind in life and constantly a step behind in figuring out the mystery of Lapsis, Imperial plays the perfect Vintage New Yorker. Ray takes advantages of the situations handed to him and isn't afraid to cause a little malfeasance when need be; with his affable easygoing nature and questionable fashion sense, he'd be right at home with the characters in The Sopranos. Still, Ray has a tenderness to him as well, especially in the treatment of his younger brother. Madeline Wise is excellent as Anna, the wily old vet of the company who links up with Ray about halfway into the movie. Strongly opinionated about the company, and capitalism in general, Anna serves as the moral compass for the film. Wise does great with the material she's given and the relationship between her and Imperial plays well and has a natural charm to it.

Written and directed by Noah Hutton, Lapsis makes every possible use of its limited budget to tell an intriguing, engaging story that touches on topics of class differential, corporate manipulation, and the strength of family bonds. Shot in a mere few weeks, the production and camerawork are commendable, bolstered by the behind the scenes featurette also included with the home release. Hutton keeps the pacing of the story moving at a nice clip; with a 108 minute runtime, the movie sails by, especially once Ray gets into the forest and starts laying cable.

Overall, Lapsis is a slickly told, entertaining film that utilizes the trappings of science fiction to tell a larger story of greed, both corporate and personal. At a time where the dangers of capitalism and exploitation of workers is becoming increasingly prevalent, Noah Hutton's story could be considered contemporary no matter what time period it was set in. Solid direction, solid acting, and a great use of a small budget ensures that while not making huge waves in the genre, Lapsis will still be considered a worthy cult film.",0
1510,"Satire is tricky to get right but at a minimum you need a good story to hang it off. honestly this did not work for me as an interesting and enjoyable film. Its just to odd, too out-there for me.",0
1511,"I enjoyed this film but felt it sort of lost it's way about 2/3 of the way through it. The concept of laying down cable through large areas of National parks was amusing, but once the protagonist returned to the city for his brother send kind of disjointed. It felt like the writer didn't know how to end the movie. With a little finessing of the script, it could have been a way better movie.",1
1512,"Interesting idea, and the similarities with the real life new businesses make you think. Still, I'd have preferred a stronger ending.",1
1513,"I'm so upset. This movie was getting me really interested in the story, and then it just ended! Just like that! I felt so confused when the end credits came on. I didn't sense any resolution. The screenwriters really cheated the audience with this one.",0
1514,"Ann Skelly plays Rose a young woman who sets out to find her birth mother and when she does, she finds out some traumatic truths about her birth parents.  Extremely well acted drama engages you immediately.  Wasn't sure what to expect here as I went into this blind.  Was very glad I did.  This is a gem of a movie.",1
1515,"Incredible performances, especially from Ann Skelly who has your heart in your mouth watching. Brilliant score too.",1
1516,"This film was one of the worst I've gone to see in the cinema this year, attempted art is a fair description I feel, slow paced, boring with an over use of moody music, solemn landscapes and characters staring into the distance.

Everybody in this film lives in an impossibly upper middle class world, from the student that can just jet off to London on a whim, to the actress who gave her up as a baby who lives in a London Mansion, and on to the rapist archeologist father who again lives in a Mansion but this time in Ireland.

Finally the ending was an atrocity, to take away the control from the female and give it to the male seems ridiculous at this point, you may as well take all the power from the female characters and tell them to get back into their place as the male character makes the final decision and controls the end narrative.

I cant recommend this one and will avoid it like the plague when it inevitably appears on our RTE screens regularly over the next few years as they try and claw back their investment money.",0
1517,"American audiences, for some reason, cannot get enough drama in their lives nowadays.  A quick run through the broadcast and cable ranks, and even the streaming options out there serves well to support that statement.  The same applies in looking at all the dramas that fill the cinematic realm, too.  To that end, Film Movement did its part this past July to give American audiences their drama fix when it brought the independent drama Rose Plays Julie to DVD.  Originally released in 2019 in Ireland and the United Kingdom through Desperate Optimists and Samson Films, the movie is an interesting though imperfect presentation that ultimately would be a good fit for Lifetime Movie Network's lineup.  That is due in large part to its story, which will be discussed shortly.  While the story is interesting, its pacing proves extremely problematic.  This will be discussed a little later.  The background information provided by Film Movement and the movie's co-directors in the DVD's packaging works with the movie's story to give it at least a little more interest.  It will also be examined later.  Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the movie's presentation.  All things considered, they make Rose Plays Julie worth watching at least once.

Desperate Optimists/Samson Films' 2019 drama Rose Plays Julie is a good option for American audiences who just cannot seem to get enough drama in their lives.  It is an especially good selection for audiences who are loyal to Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network.  That is proven in large part through the movie's story.  The story in question centers on young Rose (Ann Skelly – The Nevers, Red Rock, Kissing Candice) as she goes down the proverbial rabbit hole in search of her birth parents.  The story opens with Rose knowing the identity of her birth mother, but not that of her birth father, nor the circumstances under which she was conceived.  When her birth mother, Ellen (Orla Brady – Star Trek Picard, Fringe, Into The Badlands) reveals those circumstances, it sends Rose over the edge so to speak.  She learns the identity of her birth father – Peter (Aiden Gillen – The Dark Knight Rises, Game of Thrones, Maze Runner: The Death Cure) – and takes on a heavy plan.  As Rose and Peter get to know one another, Peter proves to be every bit the despicable figure that Rose imagined as he tries to rape her, not knowing she is his daughter.  He does not know because of the act that she takes on to find him.  One should digress here, Rose is so disgusted by Peter prior to his attempted rape of her that she had decided she was going to do something drastic (what she plans to do it pretty unsurprising, but at the same time, she cannot be blamed for wanting to do him in).  When she ends up not killing Peter, someone else does.  It does not take a genius to know who does.  To that end, how it happens will be left for audiences to learn for themselves.  Given, Peter deserved what he got.  At the same time though, it is all so formulaic.  It is, again, everything that audiences expect from a typical Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network presentation.  That is not to say that it is not worth watching.  Thanks to the actually believable work of the movie's cast, audiences will actually find themselves remaining engaged and entertained, even though they know what is coming.  To that end, the story does make this movie worth watching at least once.

While the story featured in Rose Plays Julie makes the movie at least somewhat appealing, the story's pacing detracts greatly from that appeal.  The movie's run time is listed at one hour, 40 minutes.  The thing is that because of the pacing, which drags almost consistently throughout the movie, that run time feels so much longer.  What it is that makes the pacing move so slowly is difficult to pinpoint.  Maybe it is the general lack of any musical backing to help establish much emotional connection from scene to scene.  Maybe it is all of the exposition from scene to scene.  Maybe it is both of those items or something else altogether.  Regardless of what ultimately causes the pacing to drag so consistently, that problem ultimately makes watching the movie extremely difficult.  If not for the ability of the story and the cast to keep audiences engaged, that issue would be the proverbial last straw for the presentation.  Luckily, there is still one more aspect in this movie's domestic presentation that keeps it from being a complete failure.  That aspect is the background provided about the movie in the DVD's packaging.

Co-Directors Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor point out in their comments in the movie's notes, that the movie was originally made with the intent to examine the impact of rape on victims beyond just the emotional and psychological.  Understanding this, it makes the story timely, especially what with the matter of abortion being in the headlines so much lately.  The duo adds that it just so happened that the MeToo movement just started to take hold in the U.K. as the movie's production neared its end.  So in other words, this movie was not part of that movement.  That actually makes suspension of disbelief easier.  That ability of audiences to not feel preached at in turn leads to more insurance of viewers' engagement and entertainment. 

The added note by Film Movement that the company chose to bring the movie to American audiences because of its psychological nature will resonate with audiences, too.  Again that avoidance of any promotion of preachy-ness even in these notes means that the attention was placed on the movie's intrinsic value.  Once more, that audiences do not received any of that sense of being preached at means even more that they are likely to remain engaged and entertained.  Keeping that in mind along with the interest generated through the Co-Directors' comments and through the story itself, the movie ultimately proves to be worth seeing at least once.  That is even with the issue of the movie's pacing taken into account.

Film Movement's domestic presentation of Desperate Optimisits/Samson Films' Rose Plays Julie is an intriguing addition to this year's field of new domestically-released independent movies.  Its intrigue comes in part through its story.  The story follows a young woman who is driven to the brink of committing a heinous act as she learns the circumstances surrounding her conception and birth.  The serious matter that is approached here is what makes it so engaging.  The work of the movie's cast is even more so to credit to keeping viewers' attention.  Without their work, the sad reality is that the movie is otherwise just another movie that would fit so well on Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network's daily lineup.  The movie's pacing hurts its presentation even more.  That is because it drags throughout the movie, not just at points.  Luckily its negative impact is not enough to make the movie a complete failure.  The background information shared in the DVD's packaging helps establish at least some more appreciation for the movie.  Together with the serious nature of the movie's story and the cast's work, that information gives audiences just enough to make the movie worth seeing at least once.

1518,"Plodding pace with an unlikable protagonist makes for a film that's barely watchable. Rose has no personality and from what little we're shown, she's thoroughly unpleasant which translates into a ""who cares"" scenario.  She, like Promising Young Woman, cant connect the character with human traits we can relate to, thus we just don't care, can't root for her or hope for  her. I endured to the end but with maybe 10 minutes left said to myself; ""Life is too short to waste on bad movies."" Click.",0
1519,"Disappointing on all fronts, plot, characters, mood, believability. All just vaguely depressing.",0
1520,"I watched my daughters bedroom paint dry earlier today. Turns out, that was too exciting, so I saw this movie.",0
1521,"Wish I could express the novel that I want to but not enough space... this documentary is everything & more than I could have expected! My life & everything I've grown up knowing, experimenting, & learning from would never have been what &/or where I am if it wasn't for Sesame Street & PBS!!! Not one day goes by that I don't watch something on PBS & Couldn't b prouder that my 2 kids enjoyed shows from there also.  I will always enjoy everything PBS has to offer!! Keep up all u do.. I contribute when I can xo",1
1522,If you can watch this without tears of joy (and some sorrow) you have no heart. I was eight when Sesame Street debuted so I was slightly older than their target audience but still have fond memories of watching it well into my teens.,1
1523,"Fascinating look at this iconic series and the visionaries who brought it to life. 
Most touching segment dealing with the death of one of the characters.
Funniest segment the off camera scenes.
Makes you laugh and cry.
Fabulous documentary!",1
1524,Passes the time but that's about all.,0
1525,"For anyone who has either grown up on Sesame Street or raised a child on the show, this is a must-see documentary film.  As non-critical docs go, this is likely the best ever.  Despite missing Frank Oz, which is just mind-boggling, it's flawless.  Hubby and wife both loved it for numerous reasons.  It's perfectly strung together with seamless transitions that make the movie flow so fast, you'll want so much more.  It will make you cry, then smile, sometimes in the same scene.  A wonderful film!  Hubby: 9.4/Wife: 9.6 Average:  9.5/10",1
1526,What an incredible documentary looking into this world and how it all began!!  I highly recommend!!!,1
1527,"Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street is an interesting and insightful documentary. Like many kids, I grew up watching Sesame Street. So it was interesting getting a behind the scenes look at how the show started. The film doesn’t do anything revolutionary with the format but it tells an interesting story. The way the film progresses keeps you interested, even if it runs a tad too long. Overall, I liked this. This is the definition of a solid documentary. I recommend checking this out, especially if you watched Sesame Street as a kid. ",1
1528,"This documentary about Sesame Street was very good. The entire crew did a spectacular job on documenting the history and creativeness of the most popular kids show ever made. It gives a deep insight into how the show was created and the creators that made it very popular. It's a documentary for people of all ages. If you haven't seen this documentary yet, check it out sometime. It's a definite must see.",1
1529,Fun to watch and learn from,1
1530,It was a great behind the scene production. But where was Elmo? My kids all asked about Elmo! When did Elmo become a central figure in Sesame Street?,1
1531,"Loved the movie. It was a very honest portrayal of Rita Moreno's life. She didn't hold back. Times were different then but she takes the time to self-assess her responses to events in her life and her responses. I would recommend this movie to others, particularly Latina women.",1
1532,"An inspiring film!
She's an amazing woman with an amazing story.
Every parent should take their daughters to see this movie!",1
1533,It was very good. I really enjoy biographies and true stories.  I did not like the parts where she would be in her dressing room as an older lady and she would turn on her TV. I did not like that they showed her watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearings with the woman testifying who brought sexual allegations. Moreno made comments. I did not like those political interjections they did not have to show that. It would have been a great movie without that.,1
1534,Wonderfully done movie !,1
1535,Was a great movie. I learned a lot about her that I had no idea of.,1
1536,"Absolutely AMAZING story of the life of Rita Moreno! Some things I didn't know about her, but makes me want to meet this Wonder Woman! A definite for any fans of this EGOT winner!",1
1537,Real and revealing. Also Lin-Man!,1
1538,"The movie gave a fair depiction of Rita Moreno. She was a person who did not have a easy life, oh what an actress. She faced many problems that women are still dealing with.o",1
1539,"I had recently read her book, Rita Moreno, A Memoir, and was pleased to now watch the movie unfold with her verbally telling her story and her everlasting youthfulness in full view.  I have always been a Rita Moreno fan and continue to be.",1
1540,Uplifting powerful beautiful story,1
1541,This is how great acting makes movies work. Loved loved loved this movie,1
1542,Heavy but engrossing as hell,1
1543,The best acting ever by an ensemble! With the best movie screenplay ever written!,1
1544,"This movie takes a lot more than it gives, it's hard to watch, by the end you will be drained, anxious, nauseated and deeply moved. An absolute masterclass of acting and script writing.",1
1545,"Mass is an exacting, direct drama that will leave you both drained and emotionally satisfied. It's basically a four hander and nearly all of it takes place in one room but it still felt cinematic due to the outstanding acting and writing. Two sets of parents agree to meet in a room in church. We have Jay and Gail and Richard and Linda. At first we don't know what the meeting is about but slowly pieces come togther and we learn that one set are the parents of a dead son and the other set are the parents of a son who undertook a high school mass shooting killing the other parents son. So it's essentailly a meeting to gain empathy and understanding hopefully. It starts off slowly but soon the truths and anger are unleashed, leading to emotional discoveries and regrets. It truly is compelling viewing as bare truths are unlaid starkly and quietly. The four leads are truly great. Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton and Reed Birney are all superb in a film of high intelligence and searing emotion.",1
1546,"Want to be a fly on the wall in a room with two sets of parents trying to make sense of an unthinkable tragedy? I wouldn't blame you if you didn't. Mass is a great film with outstanding performances.

However, Ann Dowd's films and TV break my immersion and I don't know why.",0
1547,"Mass is an emotional rollercoaster, and the best movie I've seen all year. A while back, I decided I'd take a break from writing movie reviews, I had no intention to end the streak. However, this movie is too good to not talk about. I don't know if I've ever been so emotionally vulnerable because of a movie in my entire life. Now, I don't usually cry during movies, or at all really. I haven't ugly cried about anything in years. However, this movie broke me. When I was nearing the end of it's runtime, my chest started to swell, but I didn't shed a single tear. An hour later, I met a minor inconvenience and just broke down sobbing. I had been subconsciously digesting the movie and the most trivial thing made me cry. It's kind of embarrassing, but that's just a testament to how damn good this movie is. I want to give a round of applause to the writers. This is a great script. The movie doesn't talk down to it's viewers, it asks them to give the screen their complete attention, as there are no cutaways or flashbacks. Everything is done through the dialogue of a few characters in a room.  I'm sure this is partially due to budgetary concerns, but it's also the film's greatest strength. If the dialogue was weak, the movie would suffer from the worst fate possible: being boring. Fortunately, the dialogue is extremely captivating. It also helps that the acting is great from everyone involved. At the beginning, I was trying to pin down who was giving the strongest performance and I honestly couldn't choose. If I HAD to pick, I'd say the best performance in the film was from Ann Dowd; she got a lot of sympathy from me. It's also worth noting that she acts a lot like she did in Hereditary (before the big reveal, of course). However, everyone was amazing. Jason Isaac brought tons of emotion to his character, even though he shined the most during his more stoic moments. Martha Plimpton plays her role of the traumatized mother who can't move on without it seeming like she's a character we've seen before. Her passive-agressiveness added so much tension that the conversation was uncomfortable, at the beginning. Her arch was the main focus and was (obviously) done well. Reed Birney played my favorite character, he had the most layers and the most disturbed conscious of the four. Something that really impressed me were the character dynamics in the film. The chemistry between all the actors made it feel like they were real people, not just a bunch of names on a script. I loved how when the conversation was starting, the two couples were seemingly pitted against each other, like they were adversaries. But by the end, they put themselves in a circle with no table in-between them. This was a very creative way of symbolizing how they went from foes to having an understanding of each other's hardships. They no longer saw the other couple as enemies, but as victims. The barrier of their own ignorance has been removed. The movie touches on this in multiple ways but I don't want to get into heavy spoilers, and I don't want this review to get too ungodly long. The creative choices and symbolism in this movie are very smart. 2/3 of the way through the movie, the aspect ratio of the movie changes. I noticed this at the time, but it was so subtle that I had to look it up after the movie was over to make sure my mind wasn't deceiving me. It seemed that the far left and far right of the screen were compressed, as the character's faces were slightly distorted when they were on the edge of frame. Despite this, you could see more of the room than you could with the previously used aspect ratio. The change could mean a multitude of things. It's my personal opinion that the new aspect ratio symbolizes that for the families to heal, they have to come together and settle their differences. When they're apart (figuratively and literally), they are a shell of their former selves, their feelings towards the other, contorted. Another interesting choice they made was to consistently cut to this field that 2 of the characters were looking at early in the movie. The first thing I noticed was the piece of red tape fluttering in the wind, but there's much more to see than just that. I have no idea what this could mean, I'll admit that. But surely filmakers of this caliber wouldn't put it in for no reason. I'm going to continue to think about it and try to decipher what it means. It's amazing how they managed to be creative with their visuals, but also with the film's audio. The choice to have no music throughout the vast majority of the film was ballsy, but it payed off in a big way. A choice like this has the chance of destroying the emotional beats of a script. People have become so reliant on music to bring heart to those impactful moments in a film that it's hard to believe it can be done. This movie's much like a stage play, as the limited setting and lack of music makes you focus on just the dialogue and emotion coming through the screen. Their conversation feels so raw, so real because of it. The lack of music makes the final scene feel so much more impactful. I can't believe they packed so much into a movie that is on such a small scale with such a small budget. Another thing I was impressed with was how the movie didn't pick sides. They trusted the audience enough to make their own decisions about the character's situation. With a story like this, it can be easy to pile on. When you go online, that's pretty much the only thing that's happening. However, in the real world, not everything is black and white. I'm glad the filmmakers had the world view to realize this, especially in a time where tribe mentality runs rampant. Now, just because this movie is great doesn't mean that it's completely perfect. My only issue with the movie is the first 5-10 minutes. They introduced a few characters that have little to no pull on the story. I can honestly see some people turning off the movie right at the beginning just because the story starts off slow. They'd be wrong for doing that, but I'm not gonna act like that wouldn't happen. I get why these minor characters were in the movie, I just think their purpose could have been fulfilled in a more concise way. Their inclusion felt unnecessary, which was weird because the team behind this film did a good job of cutting out all the fluff. That being said, this is a minor issue. Once you get past the first scene, the real story picks up, and from there on it's smooth sailing. As you can see, this movie is a must watch. If you like a slow burn or dialogue heavy films that will hit you where it hurts, this is a movie that cannot be skipped.",1
1548,This movie is extremely slow. Its like watching paint dry. The conversations between these two may be intriguing in a real life scenario but watching this as a movie is unenjoyable and dry. The 95% review on this site is severely misleading. Hope you are reading this before you wasted time watching the movie.,0
1549,"This is quite a stripped back film - its very much a case of 4 seemingly strangers, from 2 families, sat in a room facing one another and slowly opening up about the situation they faced, following an incident that we, as viewers, aren't told anything much about before the meeting begins. Its like a big jigsaw puzzle and slowly the pieces come together, from the things the various characters speak about - what they remember as parents to the affected children and so on. The cast give really quite solid performances - they seemed very credible in their facial expressions, showing the guilt and upset they clearly feel, while thinking back to what happened. All the cast are good but out of all of them, I felt that Ann Dowd gave a particularly good performance.

The more people open up, the more their emotions come to light and you can feel the other people struggling to decide how to respond, how to react and how the dynamics of the small group change as a result of what's spoken about. There are a lot of silences - quite powerful silences.

It's a hard film to say much about without clearly giving away any potential spoilers. I felt  like I could picture what was being described because it sounded so real by those describing their memories and so on. It'd be fair to say there is a haunting element to this film, yes. This is a film your likely to need tissues to hand for, if you perhaps tend to get emotional when watching films.

I thought this was quite a thought provoking and insightful watch. It's a hard watch, its upsetting because of how much emotional upset and turmoil there clearly is with the characters featured but that also, in a way, makes it a good film. It won't suit or appeal to all but yes, overall I would recommend this film, primarily as an example of the power (or the importance of/affect of) of solid acting to have an effect on the viewer, even when the setting is one pretty bare room, the acting and script undoubtedly makes it the solid film it is.",1
1550,The cast was superb. The story built to a very climatic outcome. Martha Plimpton...career performance.,1
1551,Definitely a great film to watch for anyone who isn't already aware of this complex history.,0

1554,"Whilst completely behind the narrative journey, and the heavy reliance on the rolling scenes to carry both the traditional music score and said narrative, this is at least 45mins too long. It's meandering through the story shows off the style of music, but misses the focus on it being a drama not a documentary. As a result, it doesn't deliver the sense of cultural significance of what we're being shown. That said, the detailed character study is incredible",0

1557,"A total bogus. This movie is just another propaganda piece which defames Indian classical music and musicians and singers by blaming them that they were hypocrite, they exploits youths, they were of cheap mentality etc . This film shows Hindu music artist as fraud.

This films also frames the classical music diciple as hypocrite, careless towards his mother, having blind faith.

Also shows his music teacher as fraud and using his own diciple.

On the other hand it promotes how Muslims artist enriched the classical music of India.",0
1558,"Not essential viewing, but perhaps a realistic look at trying to succeed in learning and performing classical Indian music. Any form of romanticism has been stripped away in this depiction, but the life-lesson realities are thought-provoking nonetheless. Perhaps the patience to outlast decades of stagnation is borne in the belief that there will be a succession of lifetimes to work out one's ultimate destiny.  If not, the sobering lesson here may be finding fleeting moments of bliss in the festering monotony of failure. Society's infatuation with flash-in-the-pan entertainment eclipses the discipline inherent in perfecting a traditional art form. And yet the sympathetic vibrations of the eternal can be intoxicating if one is able to unravel its subtle wavelengths.",1

1560,"When you finish watching this movie you are filled with a sense of emptiness. The movie is a tragedy of someone who devotes his life to a dream but is unable to achieve it. At the same time it's not a tragedy because it doesn't result in death of the person or the death of the person's steadfast aspirations. The camera work draws you in to make your own conclusions without focusing too much on the protagonists only. The bike scenes where he's listening to his guruji are just brilliantly shot and evoked a sense of being there in a city that never sleeps, yet in these scenes there is no one on the streets, portraying just the protagonist and his thoughts. You need to have patience to appreciate the brilliance of the script and you will be rewarded with amazing camera work and natural acting. What I liked about the movie is that the director wants you to be a part of the movie not spoon feeding it to you but letting you immerse in it and for you to draw your own conclusions.",1
1561,"When an aspiring Indian classical musician struggles to hone his craft, mostly under the tutelage of masters who demand unattainable perfection, he succumbs to doubt, frustration and disillusionment that he'll never reach his goal, feelings made worse when he witnesses others attain success with relative ease. The problem here, though, is that the screenplay fails to bring out these qualities as definitively as it could have due to its somewhat underdeveloped, occasionally unbalanced attempt to straddle the fence between expository drama and character study. To its credit, director Chaitanya Tamhane's second feature includes a wealth of mesmerizing classical Indian pieces (perhaps even bordering on a few too many at the expense of the narrative), a beautiful palette of photographic effects, a collection of intriguing voiceover insights about the relationship between music and the divine, and a strong finish in the film's closing 30 minutes. However, the picture's failure to resolve certain story threads and its sometimes-hazy focus on the core plot keep this offering from living up to the potential it might have otherwise achieved.",0
1562,"I understand that this is not a movie for everyone and someone has to dig into many aspects of what we call art, music, quality etc. I am very happy that I saw it.",1
1563,"Honestly might be the funniest movie I've seen in years, and I'm pretty hard to please. It's like a woman's version of Superbad but 10x as funny and more original. The sex scene itself is so anticlimactic and the entire movie is spent dealing with the aftermath of that. It's absolutely beautiful how it comes back around to family and love in the end. Looking forward to seeing these two actresses again and will watch anything the writers write. Very fresh take on good old coming of age.",1
1564,"Great Acting. Great Plot.

That freaking drug store guy ... I just wanna slap him.",1
1565,Plan B is a delightful film that manages to make you laugh and also think just a little bit. It has an innate charm that is helped by two very good lead performances. Best friends Sunny and Lupe attend high school in South Dakota. One night at  a party Sunny has a sexual encounter where the protection fails. The next morning they visit a chemist to buy the Plan B (morning after) pill. But the chemist won't sell it to them as they are under 18. So they plan a trip to Rapid City to visit a Planned Parenthood clinic. As you might guess nothing goes right on the road trip. So we get entwined in a funny road trip movie combined with some nuanced social commentary on how women's bodies are policed. It's a very winning film thanks to great performances from Kuhoo Verma and Victoria Moroles. They are very engaging as is this very well made film.,1
1566,"While there are many films out there with a similar or related premise, its a joy to see fresh films still offer something unique that make them worth the watch. Loved the performances of the two lead actors.",1
1567,"Loved it! Great, authentic characters, very well written. The timing was really good, it never felt rushed or overly dramatic despite the quest motif. Definitely a gem!",1

1572,"A cute buddy comedy with a mostly unknown cast. Some moments are truly clever and funny, but some are low brow shock laughs that felt heavy handed to me. If you are looking for a fun movie that will allow you to shut off your brain for a bit, it is well worth your time. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there is one major plot hole, but getting past that will allow you to take this movie for what it is, and that is a pleasant distraction.",1
1573,I am glad to have such a film to record these precious visual materials.,1
1574,Such a powerful documentary. Incredibly well documented and I encourage people to watch it. To see so many perspectives and narratives of the people who suffered and experienced difficult times during this pandemic.,1

1577,"I have deep respect for the heroes involved in the making of this film, and the many others in China who lost or risked their lives trying to get the truth out to save the lives of others. And for what? For ignorant people in Democratic countries to refuse to believe it because it's inconvenient. They will never know the sacrifices that were made because they don't care to know anything. By not seeking to understand, by refusing vaccination and by not wearing masks they will perpetuate the same kind of pain you suffered for years if not decades to come. It's devastating.",1
1578,"This documentary tells the untold stories in Wuhan. Its a hard to watch, seeing people who are about to die in the hospitals. It also shows the contrast between the response of China and US against the pandemic. Freedom VS political system. Sad to say both can have done better. Such an excellent film.",1
1579,"There is a very good presentation of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to initially conceal the menace of the COVID-19 virus, then to take credit for a victory over it while concealing the true number of deaths resulting from overwhelmed hospitals.  There is also a very good presentation of U.S. national-state-local local governments' efforts to initially conceal the menace of the COVID-19 virus.  However the presentation in the final minutes of the views of U.S. COVID-19-deniers isn't tied into the previous presentations it doesn't _explain_ why the views of these people _might_ be a reaction to previous governmental lies.",1
1580,Chilling tale of what happened and how it could have been different.,1
1581,"Making a documentary about the COVID-19 pandemic has got to be one of the most challenging ventures a filmmaker can undertake, especially given the fact that it's still ongoing. What's more, there are so many aspects to focus on, that it's undoubtedly difficult to know where to place proper emphasis. And, when one adds to that the ever-shifting sands of available and credible information (particularly from officials in China, site of the pandemic's origin, and the US), it's difficult to know what to believe. Such are the hurdles that director Nanfu Wang faced in making this film, now airing on HBO. Certain elements are sensitively and expertly handled, such as the impact of the pandemic on victims, their families and the health care workers tending to their needs, painfully sad segments guaranteed to move viewers to tears. However, the slope is considerably slipperier when it comes to addressing governmental responses to the virus. Is the ineffectual handling of the crisis due to incompetence, a lack of preparation and/or blind denial, or is something more nefarious at work, given the hardline, authoritarian, propagandist proclamations that, arguably, are being issued on both sides of the globe? On this front, the director seems less sure of herself, hedging her bets and holding back from saying what she really wants to say. That's unfortunate given that Ms. Wang is generally not one to waffle, as previously seen in hard-hitting releases like ""One Child Nation."" Here, however, she seems to resist throwing down the gauntlet, an approach that dilutes her message -- and weakens the film -- at a time when a definitive perspective is needed more than ever.",0
1582,"Sexual assault is a subject that carries important implications on multiple fronts, and it deserves serious treatment when committed to film. Unfortunately, writer-director Shatara Michelle Ford's debut feature leaves much to be desired in its handling of the topic. While the picture's heart may be in the right place -- a look at the often-frustrating handling involved in collecting forensic evidence in a rape case -- its execution of the story often misses the mark. Some issues and events are needlessly stretched out, while others receive short shrift and others still are addressed somewhat flippantly (a genuinely surprising approach in a story like this). I'm certainly not suggesting that the film lacks merit, but it surely could have been constructed more effectively than how it comes across in its current version. Admittedly, this release features some fine performances and intriguing cinematography, but the overall package is uneven, weakening whatever insights the film has to offer. Considerable retooling is necessary to fulfill this offering's potential and to convey the message of a subject that deserves better treatment.",0
1583,"Interesting for sure, and pretty strong for a debut feature. I didn't buy the central relationship at the beginning of the film, but I did start to towards the end. Really harrowing subject matter for this one and it presents it in a pretty thoughtful way.

The biggest issue is the music. It's able to draw so much tension out of moments that don't have any of it at all but I find so many of the needle drops to be so off-kilter and confusing. It feels like some of these songs were selected to show contrast and nothing more. Not a bad intent, but my goodness Tchaikovski's ""Waltz of the Flowers"" from The Nutcracker is such an inappropriate song choice to me for this attempting-to-be-eye-opening film about sexual assault. Had no clue why it was in this movie, let alone the specific scene it was in. Seemed like it only existed for the smash cut away from it, and that isn't motivation to me enough to put in a song that ""beautiful"" in a film that is anything but.

I'd love to hear or see any other interpretations, but I just found the music choices to consistently take me out of the film and completely lose me. Very competent director that I'm sure to check out the next work from, just hope to see the music strategies either changed or reflected more appropriately next time.",0
1584,"I loved the concept of the movie, however, I think that it could have been more to the evidence of the rape. Like why didn't she ask questions if the officer asked for surveillance of the club. The ending was horrible.",0
1585,"The agenda overrode the characters and the drama.
It was so obviously an Issue Movie that it forgot to be a good movie.",0
1586,Waste of time and money.,0
1587,"Finally, an indie movie with social relevance that understands film making is more than sticking a camera in the corner while two people talk.",1
1588,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Part psychological horror, part realistic drama, this debut feature from Shatara Michelle Ford is set against the backdrop of national discussions around health care and policing, the #metoo movement, and race in America. Test Pattern follows an interracial couple whose relationship is put to the test after a black woman is sexually assaulted and her white boyfriend drives her from hospital to hospital in search of a rape kit. Winner of top prizes at the BlackStar and New Orleans Film Festivals, this film offers a unique exploration of sexism from a woman's point of view. Content warning: This film includes a depiction of sexual assault.

THINGS I LIKED:
Brittany S. Hall is gorgeous and talented, so I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her.  She first appeared on VH1's hit reality show ""Real Chance of Love"" where she earned the nickname ""Hot Wings"" and was one of the winners of the show.  After that, she did Stand Up Comedy in New York City!
I thought the title of the movie was interesting. A test pattern is a fixed picture broadcast by a television station to assist viewers in adjusting their receivers. There's a social statement in there.  The test refers to the relationship, as well as to the healthcare system.
Act 1 does a good job helping the audience to fall in love with the main couple played by Brittany S. Hall and Will Brill.
I like movies that are intentionally ambiguous so that the audience can interpret the meaning for themselves.
The Mother Bear really comes out in me when I watch movies like this. I want to keep all of my girls safe and I want monsters to pay for their despicable crimes.
Interesting musical score.  I haven't decided whether or not I liked the choices, but they did catch my attention.
Kudos to Evan, the boyfriend, for being so supportive and patient.  Not all guys are jerks.  I have four sons whom I have taught to treat women well.
I'm really glad we didn't have to watch the rape.  Not showing us the details was the perfect choice made by the director because even the lead female who was raped didn't remember what happened due to her drinking and taken drugs.
For its low budget, it does a good job of taking you on an emotional journey.

 THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The director stated, ""I made Test Pattern to provoke a meaningful conversation about consent, to incorporate a black female point of view, and to spark debate while we create more nuance in the current discourse surrounding #metoo and feminism; in a movement that often focuses on the pain of white women, to the detriment of women of color, who exist within a different set of struggles and expectations.""  My biggest complaint about this movie is that the director hasn't decided exactly what she wants to say.  She wants the movie to be about race, but the main woman is dating a white guy and would have received the exact same answer at the hospital as a white woman: there are no rape kits at this hospital.  I did notice that the director chose to have the doctors and nurses who couldn't help Renesha be white and that the one nurse who finally did was black.  There are apathetic nurses of ALL colors.  It seemed like the director was pushing this to be a racial issue. The director should have focused more on the ineffective healthcare system and/or the rape culture because her casting choices didn't seem congruent with her claim that the movie is about race.
Good friends don't pressure you to drink or stay out late or do anything you don't want to do. If a friend pressures you to lower your standards, they're not a true friend.  I hated the best friend who kept pushing her friend to drink and hang out with strangers at a bar.  Women of ALL colors need to take responsibility for their choices.  If you drink or do drugs, the quality of your decision-making WILL be compromised.  (P.S.  Gummies ARE drugs.)   Let me be clear…I am NOT saying that the protagonist was ""asking for it"", nor granting any excuse for the animal who raped her.  I'm also NOT saying that only women who drink and take drugs get raped.  I'm simply saying that I hope women will learn from this cautionary tale and make better choices.  Amber, the protagonist's friend never apologized once for her critical role in how their ""Girls Night Out"" ended. She was a real jerk who kept putting her own needs and wants above her friend's wellbeing.  To all my girls who are reading this review, choose your girlfriends wisely!  Surround yourself with people who pull you up and support your choices, rather than drag you down into the gutter and pressure you to lower your standards or dismiss your goals.
It makes me soooooo mad that scumbag men can be so driven by hormones that they terrible things to another human being.
Some people will be very bored and complain that nothing really happens.
After experiencing an assault like that, one would naturally feel numb.  You kind of get that feeling watching this movie too.
 
TIPS FOR PARENTS:

1589,"Ahh yes, gotta spin that narrative. SMH This movie was a waste.",0
1590,Oh look. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life for nothing. Awful with no conclusion.,0
1591,"All they had to do was call Benson at SVU.

This is amateur filmmaker Shatara Michelle Ford's first full-length feature film as writer, producer and director, with only one prior short film on her resume.

As a new filmmaker, she certainly shows promise. And I'm (surprisingly) happy for her that the critics all raved about this film, however, I don't know why. Some comments from them on Rotten Tomatoes bring in gender, race, health system, etc. into discussion. I didn't see any of that here. All I saw was a flawed story with an obvious and much simpler alternate solution to the problem.

For starters, the plot has ridiculous holes in it. This entire film is based on a ""question mark"", of why wouldn't they just contact the police from the start, and have SVU do everything they for some reason decided to do on their own. There was zero purpose in getting that test done unless the authorities got involved, and they should have right from the start. The fact she didn't want them involved, only suggests consent, and her simp boyfriend maybe even did pick up on that, when he finally showed he had his own voice. Now if there were racial issues when the police showed up and procedure wasn't followed, then we have a realistic movie. But to make one with illogical scenarios and implausible reasoning, doesn't make a good story.

Even the dynamics between the two were ridiculous. Again, let's assume the guy is a total simp after he finds out what happens (no spoilers), what was the reasoning behind her being such an ungrateful b!tch and treating him like crap, as if he was to blame for all of this, especially when the guy was ridiculously and unrealistically that supportive and understanding? And why weren't either of them mad at her friend for allowing any of this to get that out of hand. I get that such freinds do exist, but how you treat them after was once again, unrealistic.

Then to drag this unrealistic story out for a normally-comfortable 82 minutes, with it's snail's pacing and long dragged out and unnecessary scenes - that made it feel 2+ hours, I question if the critics saw the same film I did. The constant pointless long freeze-frame and zero-dialogue scenes became annoying and boring very quick. Then there was the zero to loud obnoxious random score - even getting some circus music in there, made me shake my head many times. Even the performances were flat, boring, and unconvincing. I'm sure part blame is Ford's inexperience to direct her cast effectively.

I really can't suggest any reason to watch this one, except to support an upcoming new filmmaker - without any expectations of seeing anything substantial. It's a generous 5/10 from me, most if it going towards a ""great first effort"" ribbon, instead towards the filmmaking quality of the production.",0
1592,"GOOD BOY
Just what everyone is missing from their life: more doggie videos.

Shot from a wonderful ground level pooch point of view, ""Stray"" follows a wayward pack on the streets of Istanbul as they play, scrap, mooch, befriend, sleep, and just plain struggle to survive. Without context or history, this movie just is. And it is intoxicating.

Aligning themselves with another bunch of outcasts - homeless refuge orphans - the canines offer a different take on the man's best friend cliche, one that finds common bond in flight, survival and squatting. In what is a desperate, dangerous, harsh and bleak existence, the pack finds not only solace, but also camaraderie and slivers of unexpected joy.

Accentuated by dreamy cello accompaniment, there's a wonderful wordless poetic vibe permeating throughout, creating an enticing, sometimes hypnotic viewing experience. Often the focus of exotic wildlife films, ""Stray"" proves the gymnastic dance of mammal movement also exists on unforgiving city streets.

Includes a grand howl to prayer finale so you know you wanna like and subscribe.

1595,Storytelling is incoherent and sloppy. Lo tov.,0
1596,"Stray is a beautifully captured portrait of life for stray dogs living on the streets of Istanbul. Captured over a two year period the camera casually and effectively follows dogs as they go about their lives. The main focus is on Zeytin, a large and amiable dog who finds company with humans and other dogs whilst trying to find shelter and food. His life intersects with Syrian refugees who have their struggles. I didn't realise there were so many stray dogs in some countries, it's a different way of life. There used to be a 'kill order' but thankfully not anymore. Dogs are wonderful creatures and I spent most of this fine film just worried for their safety.",1
1597,An immersive and powerful view. And that is because the point of view is the one of the invisibles. Human and dogs alike.,1
1598,"Elizabeth Lo's intriguing documentary follows the escapades of three stray dogs through the streets of Istanbul, quite literally. Choosing to shoot the majority of the film at the same eye level of Zeytin, the main focus of the three dogs, the camera follows behind her as she goes about her daily business. Lo captures Zeytins eyes with such effectiveness at times, it seems that you can tell exactly what she's thinking, and this makes for a captivating view of the city from a completely alternate point of view. It's astonishing to see for yourself how these strays keep themselves alive, how they learn to find kindness, and how they have to deal with trouble which inevitably find them. It also makes a great double bill with......",1

It's a documentary filmed from dog level and there's some serious shaky cam which kinda works here, but don't watch this on your phone.  If you become immersed in this universe you'll love the film.  If you love dogs you'll love this film.  It's gentle and the ending is wonderful.  Quick at 72 minutes!  Hubby: 8.0 Wife: 7.2 Average 7.6/10",1
1601,"Kedi, the doc about stray cats in Turkey, was great. Following around a different cat in each segment, each with something of its own personality, its own neighborhood or haunts, was compelling as they felt like actual characters to an extent. Not so with Stray, which follows one dog more or less, but with much less interesting results.

1610,"This ""film"" has possibly the dumbest ""plot"" in the history film. The only reason it's rated high by critics is because it contains THE MESSAGE.  You won't miss it because they constantly beat you over the head with it. 

Camera work, editing and acting are all passable to good. However sacrificing any sort of competent writing to push an agenda kills this ""film"" dead.",0
1611,"Goofy and kinda fun, but utterly mediocre. ""Rubber"" is a kind of perfect comparison, where I'm glad that someone made a bizarro horror, but the ""critical freshness"" of this flick is very misleading.",0
1612,"Overall, it's pretty amazing that George A. Romano made a movie in 1973, which has finally surfaced thanks to the good people at Shudder! This is unlike anything I have ever seen from George A. Romero and cinema. The Amusement Park is a world that is unforgettable and yet disturbing. It is a unique horror style filled with creativity that will have its viewers feeling and sympathising with every moment on screen. Visiting The Amusement Park is worth your while, and who knows, maybe I will see you at the park one day.",1

The first few scenes are repetitive and predictable, but they do get the attempted message across. And then... wow; the movie has a gut wrenching and breathtaking second act. The lengthy seven minute fortune teller scene is a masterpiece and when that old lady starts breaking down because nobody bothers to help her save her dying husband, it really sticks with the viewer. And then the final clip in the park, when Lincoln Maazel's character (acted phenomenally) finally starts to get his way but is crushed when it's brutally short lived, that tears your heart out. 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘈𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘬 is made of incredible sound design that adds to the depressing tone, and it's simply horror in the most effective way.",1
1618,"This film is transparent in its politics and comes out of a specific moment in time. It is an analogy for the general experiences of the disaffected and forgotten elderly. In this regard it's more of an unsettling parable that a traditional horror movie. That said, I lingered with me.",1
1619,"My mind blew a bit this past weekend cause of this film. It is a film that became lost and was restored and this film shows why it is so important to save lost films. It is a film that should have always been out since it's original release. It is like George A. Romero wrote a classic novel that is a true classic. This is a very important and very well done film about being a Senior Citizen and aging and the injustices that come with it. You see money issues portrayed, and a senior home itself showing that it could a bit not fun for Seniors to be in a nursing home in ways but there are great things about being in those too of course. The film also shows how Seniors can fight with another, and how they just are not getting the help and food they deserve to have. And all of these issues and more are told through symbolically through an amusement park and it is genius. This film speaks to today seriously and is a total wake up call that we must help Seniors... And people in general. Also we all need Jesus, Jesus is our only hope.",1
1620,"George A. Romero's lost film is a horror curiosity unlike pretty much any other. The central performance from Lincoln Maazel is sympathetic and emotionally affecting, and it adds even more to an already weighty film. It's unsettling, downright bizarre, and it succeeds in its message about elder abuse and abandonment.",1

By her own words, Julia comes across as a solid feminist who believed both in women as homemakers as well as women with careers, and made advances in spite of a male-dominated industry. Know that this is a CNN production, and as such, prepare yourself for an overly-heavy peppering of political discourse: the reveling in Julia's emancipation from her conservative family, caricaturization of her Republican Conservative parents as ignorant, angry and anti-culture, and propping up as an flag-carrier of nouveau liberal ideals. Outside of these unessential parentheticals, Julia is an entertaining and uplifting biography,",1

But it's all kinda slow and not in any way provcative, mind-changing, illuminating. Was only a couple notches above watching paint dry, for me. Have no idea why it is intriguing to many.",0

1655,"THE B-TEAM
A rolling and coasting thrill ride with abrupt gear changes to keep everyone guessing is the bestest Hollywood smirk action blockbuster to come out of Denmark. Mads Mikkelson stars, of course, as a stone faced army machine brought home from one tour of duty to another. The shocking death of his wife paratroops our hero back into civilian life where a reluctant teenage daughter awaits parenting.

The circumstance of tragedy leads to the inevitable daft father surly daughter clash, and the movie looks well on the way to an emotional series of life lessons. Don't hunt for the tissues just yet, for there is more afoot than meets the misty eye.

Guilt haunted by the explosive train crash which he luckily survived, a conspiracy nut and statistician whiz seeks some sort of redemption, which he finds in a far fetched theory, that once numbers are crunched becomes too plausible not to act on. Joined by a couple of other keyboard tapping stooges, they manage to convince our hero of their theory. With a satisfying explanation and a villain to focus on, Markus (Mikkelson) goes into combat revenge mode. It is awesome, and much easier than parenting. Grief is hard, revenge is easy.

Tagging along in a bizarre B-Team special forces unit of misfits - computer geeks with guns - brings much needed levity to an otherwise efficient by the numbers body count flick. The oddball characters' hilarious internal squabbling and deadpan commentary provide the perfect balance for this dark, violent tale.

""Riders of Justice"" plays on the theory of chance, that certain choices no matter how insignificant, lead to a series of events. And true to theory, everything is linked from start to finish in a clever loop that wraps this movie present with a wonderful Christmas bow. A real Danish treat. Cheers.

1658,"This film truly has it all...action, intrigue, heart, and humour, as well as characters you'd never find in American cinema. Definitely worth your time!!",1
1659,"Brilliant. Everything about this film is superb. Other writers and directors should note that this is how it should be done. What was most impressive, was how much you actually care about each and every character for entirely different reasons. 
The plot, the acting, the script, the action scenes, directing, pace - the whole lot get maximum points!
Very rarely do I give five stars - but this totally deserved it🥳",1
1660,"Rarely do you find a movie of this caliber these days. It's a film about violent coincidence that brings together an odd group of quirky, emotinally damaged outcasts that somehow pull together to not only exact revenge but to teach each other the importance of maintaining even a shred of sanity in their broken down worlds. Full of the unexpected with moments of intensity and even humor that make this a rare gem to behold.",1

The more I think about it -- it's a movie that doesn't try to tell you what to think or how to feel about it. This was refreshing! An intelligent, thoughtful, playful movie with much that was amusing and much that was thought-provoking and even profound and heartbreaking. A movie that will stay with us. Much credit to the actors and writer-director Maria Schrader. The whole production original, fine, and satisfying.",1

1667,"I'm Your Man is a very clever and intelligent film about love and destiny. It's a very thoughtful film that is a blend of comedy, drama and sci-fi. German director Maria Schrader has crafted a film that is equal parts charming and smart. Dr Alma Feser is a leading archeologist in Berlin. She is co opted into a study that will see her receive extra funds for her work. The study involves AI robots and testing their suitablity to actually become partners with humans. Alma is sent 'Tom' for three weeks and although she is very luke warm on the idea eventually comes to like his company. Alma is lonely but can't really connect with the idea of a robot filling that hole. The film beautifully handles the philosophical questions of human existence and also the time honoured thought of whether robots can truly have human feelings. It's all done in a very charming and sometimes funny way. Maren Eggert and Dan Stevens are superb in the feature roles, adding a warmth and generosity to ther roles. I really enjoyed this film. It's very smart and engaging.",1
1668,"A wonderfully unique performance by Dan Stevens as Tom, a companion, carries a film that's slow paced, but rewarding.  The German-Language picture, brings up some pretty interesting questions about life, openness, and human's ability to adapt.  There are several good laughs, to go along with the overall feeling of delight that should go along with watching.  Nobody plays bland like Stevens and this is the perfect role.  Maren Eggert, and Stevens have a wonderful comedic and romantic chemistry.  It's a concept that seems wacky, but it's very emotional and flat out works.  This film is a journey that may be different for everyone, but should be cerebral.  Final Score: 8/10",1
1669,Engaging. Excellent acting by major and minor characters. Tremendous conceptually and a well written script.,1
1670,"Is love nothing more than a cure for loneliness and disappointment? And if it is nothing more than that does it matter what form the cure takes?

This movie will not appeal to everyone - and the movie HER certainly explored some of this.  But it is charming enough and well done.

I will say that the portrayal of Tom at times reminded me of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.",1

I have immense gratitude to Ron and Russel Mael for all their hard work as well as to Edgar Wright for making this beautiful film.

I won't spoil it, but I expect this film will be harder to get through for most folks than the average horror film because there's something to cringe at for everyone in this gem.  It's hard to believe that a film like this was a directorial debut as well and on such a modest budget.  Well done!",1

1687,"MAZEL TOUGH
The relentless interrogation onslaught of relatives near and distant in any gathering is plot enticing, but a post funeral shiva makes it a comedic, claustrophobic proposition of terrifying proportions.

As the doughy-eyed Danielle, Rachel Sennott hits all the right and wrong notes of a young Jewish adult spinning at her crossroads. When prodded by the nosy as for her expectedly lucrative life path, she deflects the jabs with thick smoke, curvy mirrors and clever white fibbing. Seems innocent enough, but Danielle is anything but innocent. Well, in the traditional sense. And cracking tradition is what ""Shiva Baby"" is all about.

Her ""babysitting"" gig is actually some ambiguous sex work with Max, a sugar coated daddy. Her previous relationship, much to the eye-rolling chagrin of her fast explaining parents, was with Maya. There's a lot to unpack in Danielle's bursting suitcase.

As if rubbing sharp elbows with the stalking relatives wasn't enough, the shiva house welcomes Danielle's entire relationship world into a crazy jail of confinement. Wine is gulped, bagels are scarfed, eyebrows are raised, cross room glances burn. It is one simmering plot boiler. Glorious.

Funny, horrific and thought-provoking in equal does, ""Shiva Baby"" is the condensed drama nightmare most scatter to avoid.

Oy vey.

1688,"This is a quite claustrophobic feeling domestic drama, with a really good use of stringed instrument type music to really bring home the tension felt in certain scenes. The camerawork used also really highlights the almost suffocating atmosphere the main character, Danielle, finds herself in. I thought the main performance was very well done by Rachel Sennott - she does well at putting across her exasperation and frustration etc. in her facial expressions (i.e. she's quite facially expressive). I also liked the way strong lighting/colours were used to again highlight the sense of intensity and tension present in scenes, or moreso felt by Danielle. Yes, I'd recommend this film as a good indie film, a good film about social judgements in a Jewish funeral setting I guess - family based/domestic social judgements and expectations in a religious setting.",1

No doubt Seligman had the chance to experience this sort of situation without too many degrees of separation at NYU--and this portrayal might have raised an eyebrow 40 years ago--but Shiva Baby is too watered down and devoid of bite to be of much interest today when minors are trafficking themselves on OnlyFans to pay for drugs, three decades after Seinfeld already covered all the goy/Jew humor here but with subtlety and actual humor rather than awkwardness trying to pass itself off as something erudite.  Perhaps Seliman's next film ""Bottoms"" (due 2023) will have more to offer that's less cliche than it's title already is.",0

La scintilla iniziale non è particolarmente originale, lo scambio di bambini piuttosto un cliché ma fortunatamente tutto ciò che gira intorno è ben strutturato e la trama piena di eventi che ne cambiano continuamente la natura.
In alcuni passaggi non si comprende molto bene la linea temporale e questo è l'unico momento in cui ci si rende conto che si è davanti ad un riassunto.
Il finale ha un tocco nostalgico e storico che non ci si aspetta e che aggiunge qualità.",1
1699,"Penelope Cruz did an amazing job with very bad script that basically felt like they ran out of time and skipped over any resolution to the stories. Both mothers reactions (or lack there of) to the dramatic events with their babies were completely unbelievable - obviously written by a man who has no concept of being a parent, and there was no cohesion between the story of the mothers and the story of the forgotten ancestors who died in the war, which felt forced and disjointed. From someone who loves almodovar, this was perhaps his worse movie ever. ",0
1700,"MOTHER AND CHILD
Typical Pedro Almodovar, expertly prodding his beloved Spain, this time with two forks: literally digging up Franco's fascist history, and then focusing on the complicated role of single, first time mothers. Long standing muse Penelope Cruz handles both utensils, as the orchestrator of village women who long their victimized men exhumed from a mass grave for proper burial, and as an unexpected expecting mother.

It is a fascinating dual trip, with just enough overlap before a coalescing finale. As the strong centre piece, Cruz is awesome as usual. Professional photographer turning a chance fling (how European) into a sudden family affair at an advancing age seems ripe for whoopsie adventure. Round and hospital bound, she befriends another solo expector, much younger but equally determined. The game of chances continues as the ladies give birth on the same day, solidifying their bond, a bond rekindled by yet another chance encounter down the line.

This may sound soap opera-y, and it is, but Almodovar shakes his film awake with a stunning mid-plot turn. A higher gear at the perfect time. The strength of the main character assaulted by circumstance, cracks a well established facade, and presents the mother of all dilemmas. Viewer patience pays off as ""Parallel Mothers finally gathers proper steam.

A movie that digs up the past, stokes the present, and looks to the future in equal, messy and thought provoking doses, with the complexities of lineage as a central theme, and Cruz as the ideal conduit. Almodovar has done it again.

1711,"The Worst Person in the World es magnífica, con el pensamiento de que ""El arte tiene que ser desorientado y libre, tiene que ser un poco peligroso para ser divertido"", la película en sus 12 capítulos cuenta una historia brutal, un estudio de personaje muy bien planteado que se basa más en las emociones que en la historia en si. Una típica película de un pez fuera del agua que en el como se desarrolla la película el personaje de Julie va evolucionando de una manera muy natural, dándole capas a su personaje con las que el espectador puede empatizar y repudiar al mismo tiempo. 
Me parece que la película tiene como eje 2 mensajes principales 1.- la superficialidad que la misma sociedad estipula en todas sus etapas, ya sea en redes sociales que es un espejismo de la vida misma que se va enlazando con los sentimientos reales de una persona, que a veces se pierden por la presión social o por el sub consciente mismo, que se va explorando más en las diferentes etapas que la protagonista tiene con Aksel y Eivind, y la evolución de una relación, ya sea una relación mental, física o hasta espiritual, el como aunque quieras dejar a la persona y borrarla de tu mente varias costumbres que hasta repudiabas de la otra persona se van amoldando en tu día a día, cosa que le pasa a Julie y Eivind cuando empiezan a salir, en la búsqueda de su autenticidad toman ciertas actividades y pensamientos de su pareja anterior. Que tiene una alegoría magnifica con los celulares, El como desde el cristal donde juzgan las demás personas, los protagonistas buscan solo mostrar lo que quieren mostrar mientras actúan para los ""espectadores"" de su vida ídeal. Y 2.- la Hipocresía, que en la película toma más una expresión liberal, la libertad de la hipocresía y la hipocresía de plantear una libertad según tu perspectiva de la vida, que se profundiza más en el capítulo ""Tierras Altas de Finlandia"" , en la que Eivind se da cuenta de la hipocresía de no compartir los mismos intereses de la otra persona aunque sean realmente importantes para su pareja, en la que antepuso su felicidad personal antes que en buscar un equilibrio con la otra persona, siendo infiel y ganado el estigma de ""Peor Persona del Mundo"", ¿pero está mal?, otro de los planteamientos que busca conectar con el espectador.

Técnicamente la película es brillante, con una fotografía que sigue a los personajes como si el espectador estuviera en el conflicto, con un sentimiento de añoranza, ya que es como salir de viaje con los personajes, salir de la ya comercializada USA para viajar a la más tranquila e inexplorada Noruega, por eso se graba tan simplista, no busca los mejores colores o los planos más profesionales, busca más la realidad cotidiana de los personajes, que en esa misma realidad se dan el lujo de introducir tintes surrealistas en la historia, en las que logran montajes perfectos, ya sea la escena en la que Julie busca por primera vez a Eivind mientras el mundo se paraliza, en la que Julie sale por primera vez de la burbuja y de la realidad sistematizada para crear su propia realidad en la que busca la atracción física sin importar lo anticlimático que pueda parecer en su vida o ya sea el capítulo 8, en la que a través de un viaje aún más surrealista Julie se da cuenta de sus inseguridades, y como en sus 30 años no ha conseguido nada formal, todo es un superficial ""Dulce Romance"", como si su vida fuera una obra de teatro, todos son espectadores y críticos del personaje superficial al que actúa. La fotografía es desafiante y busca impactar, con una crítica a la independencia, el Cómo los grandes estudio le quitan el realismo a la historia en general para imponer situaciones y personajes autofabricados, por eso hay desnudos en la película;  porque en la trama hay personas reales, con todo lo que involucra la palabra, que se profundiza más en la película en la que se basa el cómic de Aksel, le quitan el * para ser un producto más comercial, pero con ello quitándole el realismo en la que se basa su personaje; Y podrá seguir, la película más allá de su cautivador guion se esmera en construir personajes reales, personajes con una psicología propia, con la que puedas empatizar con ellos y ver el mundo desde su perspectiva.

The Worst Person in the World es un camino en el que mientras más vas avanzando te encuentras con una historia fabulosa que en cada escena priorizan el realismo que la explosividad, una experiencia única.",1

Tilda Swinton gives a good performance as the unnamed main character, the lady who we hear discussing things via a phone call in which we can't hear the other person. It's very much an example of showing things from the one persons perspective. It shows Tilda's acting range quite well - it almost surprised me how strongly emotional she becomes, given her composure at the start. Its a curious character based short film - as ever in Almodovar's films, colour plays a particular role in this title. I couldn't not notice the brightish colours present in Tilda's costumes, the home furnishings and so on. This is a slightly quirky and perhaps curious watch, not a bad one, a thoughtful film somewhat that does touch on suicide, so if suicide or self harm triggers you, then your best avoiding this but otherwise I'd recommend it, yes.",1

1744,"One thing I noticed, and adored, about Almodóvar, is that despite his unequivocal propensity for incorporating comedy with melodrama, there's no way his films could come across as either silly or overly sentimental. For his stories are laced with considerable nuance. His Women on the Verge on a Nervous Breakdown, which is also based on Jean Cocteau's play, ""La voix humaine"" as this short is, maintains an incremental humorous tone so much so it could be adequately described, by its end, as a farce. Yet, as we see Pepa trying to figure out why her lover dumped her without an explanation, Almodóvar delves into Pepa's psyche with great subtlety that's apt for her precarious state. That's why I thought The Human Voice would benefit greatly from the concentrated nature of short films. Our unnamed protagonist's wait for three days for her lover to come in a last chance to see him has filled her with rage. A vindictive rage almost identical to that of The Bride in Kill Bill, but she still loves him. So she acts out like a maniac: stabbing one of her lover's suits with an axe in a harmless cathartic release. She wouldn't dare to actually hurt him; she still loves him. Therefore, she's so vulnerable. Over the course of her conversation with his lover, her seemingly stable and wry demeanour gradually crumbles, exposing both her helplessness and her futile undirected rage. Almodóvar brilliantly highlights such contradiction and lays her feelings bare by showing the soundstage her exuberantly furnished, sumptuously coloured apartment is constructed upon. As she grows more desperate, she begins to lose control. Finally, she decides to free herself from the submissive woman she's always been, and put an end to their toxic relationship — after all, her love made her too fragile and delicate to venture to turn the tables on him as Alma did on Reynolds in Phantom Thread. The thing is, I didn't feel that she loves him. What's baffling is that I can't put my finger on why exactly I feel so, but it's likely due to the stagy feel this film has. It is a showcase of Tilda Swinton's thespian prowess, but, at times, her monologue comes off rather like a soliloquy — like there's no one on the other side of the phone line. Regardless, The Human Voice is an eye-popping, exquisitely-made feminist work with witty sarcastic undertones.",1
1745,"This was quite captivating, I didn't know what to expect but I trusted the duo; Tilda Swinton & Almadovar. Brilliant monologue, it was like watching a whole relationship and witnessing the end with all the humane emotions.",1
1746,"i like Tilda, but this was boring.",0
1747,"This is a fascinating documentary about the art world, art museums, art galleries, art dealers, art history, and the way they intersect with big money.",1
1748,"The Lost Leonardo is a documentary about this supposed Leonardo da Vinci painting that was rediscovered recently and sold for an unprecedented amount of money to the initially mysterious highest bidder. The film doesn't explore all of its questions fully, but for the most part it delivers. The real-life story itself is just fascinating while the questions of the validity of this auction world and the true identity of the painter made for a thought-provoking viewing experience.",1
1749,"Truth is stranger than fiction.  The underbelly of the art world is a fascinating study in the creation of perceived value.  If you ever buy fine art, you must see this docudrama.",1
1750,Really enjoyed this. Very well-researched insight into the dark undertones of the Art dealer world and a credible account of what looks like the biggest money-washing exercise ever. Taking sides here: I love Leonardo's handful of paintings we are aware of - this ghastly painting is most definitely not one of them for me. Still hidden away..Abu Dhabi ? Who knows......Great fun to watch,1
1751,A thrilling look into the mysterious world of art buying. Had to watch it twice in a row to really digest all of the juicy information they divulged. Highly recommended!,1
1752,"While 'The Lost Leonardo' is still in the very least misplaced, the story of the painting is riveting in the very least.  Who knew there was so much corruption in the art world?  As the layers of the onion are revealed, the tale gets more bizarre.  It doesn't matter if you're into the art scene or not, it's too crazy to believe.  A very well constructed documentary that never really resolves in multiple directions.  And that's ok.  Final Score: 8/10",1
1753,"Great documentary about 2 unrelated worlds...Art and Art Collecting.
Well made and fascinating.",1
1754,"If you love art, want a look behind the scenes of the art market and some of the murky players in it, THIS is a must see.

I found it very informative, interesting and entertaining!",1

1756,Excellent documentary.,1
1757,What an incredible film with so much heart. You can feel the spirit of this movie and it's both heart wrenching and inspiring at the same time. I found myself in awe of the journey I was taken on. What a beautiful film. Beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to see such a display.,1
1758,"It's a very moving story - a beautiful love story and a familiar (but difficult) story of the will to make a better life for yourself and those you love - the so-called ""American Dream."" Best of all, it's based on the true story of the protagonists. I loved it!",1
1759,"I Carry You With Me is a beautiful meditation on love and hope and nationhood. Based on the true life stories of Ivan and Gerardo the film blends in real life footage to heighten the emotional impact. Told over may years we follow Ivan as a young man meeting Gerardo in Mexico and falling in love. But their love is forbidden in a conservative nation. Ivan also has a young child in a relationship that rings false. Eventually he leaves Mexico to start a new life. He settles in New York and begins his dream of becoming a chef. Eventually Gerardo joins him but even though their life is great they can't return to Mexico nor see Ivan's son. This superb film has a beautifully contemplative nature, one of serenity and joy and love and also heartbreak. A small wonder of a film.",1
1760,"Heidi Ewing specializes in documentary films, but her 1st narrative feature is an incredible debut in which she relies on some doc techniques to give the movie authenticity.  A powerful love story that takes a turn and makes the film super real.  One thing that took me out of the picture, was the narration which sometimes is more dreamlike than realistic.  The jumping back and forth can be confusing, but it's used in a way that ties the film's third act together.  The two actors playing the leads, Armando Espitia and Christian Vázquez  have a wonderful chemistry. These are the issues that immigrants face and the fact it's based on a true story makes it that much more genuine.  Heartfelt, yet quietly intense the third act almost entirely feels like you could be watching a documentary feature! Don't be afraid of subtitles if Spanish isn't your language, this is worth the time!  Final Score: 8.2/10",1
1761,"A gay love between two men at the height of homophobia in Mexico and takes you on a journey that culminates in New York City, is a fantastic look into the personal lives of two men who fell in love!!!",1
1762,"This movie was fantastic. There are so many fantastic themes and storylines that are told within this film, and none of them feel superfluous. It's a beautiful piece about love, homosexuality, family dynamics, immigration, the American dream, and love of country.  The imagery paints a beautiful picture of Mexico, New York City, and the people who have chosen both as their home. I plan on rewatching this film soon, and I'll probably annoy my friends with how much I talk about this movie.",1
1763,"A poem of a film, visually and in the narrators words....a love story, an immigarnt story..powerful and moving and relatable to anyone who has left the past and people and dreams behind. Very emotional....the films I like the most carry a mood, this one brought me wistfulness, longing and tears. Beautifully shot",1
1764,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Sensitive, emotional and gripping, yet quiet, this film captures all that would likely happen in a relationship such as this.  Incredibility beautiful writing, this sounds at times like poetry and at others like a documentary.  Just outstanding!",1
1765,"A very honest & heartfelt film that’s worthy of the rave reviews, but I can’t help but think it would’ve been a better film with less flashbacks & less jumping around time frames. The confusion distracted from the sentiment ",1

1767,"Absolutely fantastic especially, if you love Dogs and Italy",1
1768,"A group of older men and their dogs search for truffles. It's informative and occasionally entertaining, but drags a bit. Overall, it's about men who are too passionate to retire. It's worth watching.",1
1769,"Beautiful static vignettes with a wonderful soundtrack capture one of the most obscure and dying ""professions"" in Italy. In the sense that there is no narrative, it's just moments from life shot over apparently three years. To be honest, not many of the hunters have anything interesting to say in those staged dialogues. In fact, if you're looking for some extensive information about the process of truffle hunting, this isn't that type of documentary. These old man like bearded dwarfs in the mountain refuse to disclose any secrets and would rather take them to their grave. It doesn't stop them, however, from complaining that young people are not interested in their craft. The movie is very grim in this aspect because the longer it goes on, the faster it becomes more apparent that these people will not leave anything behind but their dogs, as every venture into the night of the forest may be their last. 
There isn't anything compelling about the truffle trade or black market either if you're wondering. Even though they do show that process.",0
1770,A fascinating glimpse of the lives of elderly truffle hunters in Piedmont. A beautifully crafted and edited documentary.,1
1771,"One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  If Vermeer made a movie, it would look like this one.  We also loved the characters.",1
1772,"The Truffle Hunters is a cozy, lovely documentary about truffle hunting in Northern Italy. It's the type of specific movie in location and subject that is still universal in its themes as it deals with the evils of capitalism as well as humans taking advantage of nature and its resources. The movie is gorgeously shot and particularly effective when focusing on the heartwarming relationships between these villagers and their dogs.",1
1773,Anything Italians engage in that is food-related is pure delight and the ultimate affirmation of life itself.,1
1774,"This film is art.  Absolutely joyous but super simple and quiet.  A study of humans. I think of Jacques Tati or Francis Ford Coppola, but quieter.  Incredible moments and the photography is pure genius.  100%",1
1775,"We were excited for the hubby and wife date night doc, 'The Truffle Hunters', but it was a totally missable adventure.  If you speak ANY Italian don't watch with the subtitles as they are often incorrect and lag way behind.  This takes away from the beauty of the film because the story gets completely muddled in a mess of subtitles.  When conversations are happening and people watching can't figure out who's saying what you have a problem.  There's a better film in there, but this one needed a lot more work!  Hubby: 6.2/Wife: 3.2 (Only b/c it's shot in Italy) Average: 4.7/10",0
1776,"This great film takes us deep into the heart of Piedmont's truffle country and truffle culture.  Most of the dialogue is in the local dialect, as we follow aging truffle hunters, their dogs, and the truffle merchants who buy and sell their product.  Wonderful, heartwarming.",1
1777,A French fairytale that stretches just over an hour. C'est parfait!,1
1778,"American film critics lose their senses when it comes to French cinema, which lost its glow decades ago.  It seems they want to prove how sensitive and sophisticated they are, so they go overboard with praise for films that are really a big artsy-fartsy nothing.  And so for this one.  I think I get what the director was trying to say, but in the end it is pretentious, emotionally flat, tedious, and fails to make a point.  It is confusing rather than imaginative in how it combines fantasy and reality.  The little girls are adult creations, not real people. It is cinematically uninventive and the acting is as dull as the film itself.  But it's French, so the American critics invent all kinds of convoluted reasons to love it.  Go ahead and watch it to see if I'm missing something, which I doubt.",0

I didn't know what to expect from this going in, it's a deeply moving yet whimsical story of loss and grief through the eyes of a child.  A lot going on in such a short run time, yet it doesn't feel rushed at all.  
Wonderful little film.",1
1780,"Celina Sciamma's (Director/Screenwriter/Costume Designer) follow up to the awesome 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is another remarkable original French film.  It is simple, subtle, and sublime.  It's only 71 minutes, and it takes a little bit of time to fire, but once it does expect to hit pause and have plenty of tissues.  Josephine Sanz and Gabrielle Sanz are twins, but they play a mother and a daughter and from there don't find out anything about this film!  Final Score: 8/10",1
1781,Super sweet! And a great plot. New ideas CAN still occur in cinema.....Hollywood are you paying attention?,1
1782,What seems to be written for a short film is stretched out to a 70 minute runtime. The child actors are competent enough performers I suppose. The subject matter and underlying theme is interesting but the story lacks any and all gravitational pull.,0
1783,"This is a charming, understated (low key) watch, depicting a young girls take on the situations she comes across at her young age, including her mum suffering grief at the loss of a relative. I thought it was quite touching how the mother and child interact, their bond and how emotionally frank some of the discussions are between parent, relative, friend and child. It is quite touching at times. There's a charming innocence to it and the lack of clear direction somehow adds to the intrigue about what the young girl is pursuing. Its a lovely depiction of young friendship and suffice to say, I really enjoyed it, so I'd certainly recommend it, yes.",1
1784,"we only have small glimpses into what are parents life where like as children yet we feel the effect.  We romanticize what we now sometimes for others.  This picture made me feel more understanding, sympathy for what the realty probably was and they like you and I did the best they could.  That is all we can ask.",1
1785,"Petite Maman is a warm bundle of cinematic magic. Director Celina Sciamma's French coming of age sci-fi hybrid never gets too bogged down in tedious specifics of its fantastical set-up. Petit Maman bends time to tell the story about the bond between a daughter and her mother that transcends it.

Petite Maman, which I had the pleasure of seeing at the Middleburg Film Festival, centers itself around a little girl named Nelly (Josephine Sanz) and her family, reeling after the death of a loved one, as they spend some time in Nelly's mother's childhood home. Nelly's mother leaves the family behind in the midst of the immense grief she's suffering, leaving her husband and daughter with little idea of when she'll return. In the meantime, Nelly ventures into the woods, where she meets and begins to pal around with a young girl, who she learns, by some twist of cosmic fate, is a much younger version of her own mother, who faces trials of her own.  A single stretch of woods bridges decades between them. Together, they try to help each other cope in these moments of personal turmoil and Nelly can maybe get to understand why her mother left and what she's going through.  This movie quite literally follows its two leads after their meeting, making food, building forts, making believe. Petit Maman uses those pastimes of youth to hit audiences with a surprisingly layered exploration of something as monumental as grief from a kid's perspective. 

I loved, loved, loved the setup of this movie—it doesn't ever seek to explain how Nelly and this younger version of her mother meet in terms of time and space, but it uses that heightened concept to speak to something more human. Here, two children reckon with fear and their powerlessness in the conflicts they face, and in the comfort and security they give each other lies the courage to face them.

The lesson of Petite Maman is just to be there for the people you love in times of great difficulty. 

I give Petite Maman 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18. It's an understated, but moving little gem that I hope doesn't escape people's radar. Petite Maman is currently streaming on various VOD platforms including iTunes and Vudu. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!",1
1786,"It is so rare to see a movie with such a pure feeling of enchantment that it may seem perfect. With a running time of just 72 minutes, this is a modern fairy tale with no superfluous details. When the maternal grandmother of eight year old Nelly (Josephine Sanz) dies, her family returns to her mother's home to remove her belongings. After her mother leaves, Nelly goes into the woods and meets a young girl about her age, with a striking resemblance to herself, who is building a fort. The girl, Marion (Gabrielle Sanz), asks for her help and the two girls begin to bond by playacting, and through frank conversations related to their mystical connection. Writer-director Celine Sciamma has crafted a magical fairy tale about childhood grief, and what it would be like to interact with your mother as a child without ever feeling lachrymose. Real-life sisters Josephine Sanz and Gabrielle Sanz give astonishing, naturalistic performances. The exquisite images are once again photographed by the extraordinary Claire Mathon. Miyazaki's influence can definitely be felt here. With Stephane Varupenne, Nina Meurisse, and Margo Abascal. In French with English subtitles.",1
1787,"It was a really sweet and exiting story. It reminds me of Avatar the last airbender; it has a very childish art style and characters, but it can hint on a bunch of deeper elements, but does so subtly, unlike a lot of movies nowadays which shovel their themes down your throat.",1

1789,I like about the Mitchell versus machines technically is a movie that you can relate to and also they even brought the same creators of Spider-Man into the spider-verse I think it's funny that they reference YouTube and they have dug the pug as monchy I highly recommend this movie it's on Netflix,1
1790,Didn't work for me. But I could see kids really enjoying it.,0
1791,Absolutely wonderful. Shed sad tears but so many more happy tears. Relatable sub context of a child leaving for college. Just the right amount of whimsy. Fun animation style and storytelling. Hits the right heavy and light notes. Good pacing. One of my favourite all time animated movies,1
1792,"this is amazing, i watched it 9 times by now",1
1793,"This was a poorly animated cesspool of ""relatable"" and completly dull and simply unfunny humor. The premice of the movie has been overly used in many movies before it. It also gave my son aids once he watched it. So dont watch this if you dont want aids.",0
1794,The best movie ever animated!,1
1795,"NEVER WATCH THIS! This will be a stain on my memory from now on. With all these positive reviews, I thought I had watched the wrong movie but I was wrong. I made an account just to say this was the worst movie I've ever seen. It's was unbearably cringe, sappy, and cliche. Never, ever watch this.",0

1801,One of the best films seen lately.,1
1802,"It's one of those three-hour movies that flows like a short film.  The mostly Japanese- language picture is all over the map, but ends up in a really powerful and riveting place.  It sounds daunting and it does demand your attention, but it's a rare beast in that right after the first watch, you almost immediately start thinking about it and ponder a rewatch.  Tonal changes are some of the most subtle on film.  Performances are nuanced in Ryusuke Hamaguchi's latest.  The talented filmmaker has been trending to this and may finally have his masterpiece.  Final Score: 9.4/10",1
1803,"One of the best films of the past twenty years.  Remarkable, tragic, beautiful.
A masterpiece.",1
1804,"Honestly I expected much more which likely contributed to my disappointment.  The sub plots of the interactions between not the two main characters was somewhat fascinating, but over all the movie fell flat from what I saw as possible.  I do not have a problem with a slow paced movie at all, but this one just didn't really go anywhere..pun intended.",0
1805,"It´s a great movie that give something special, the kind of thing that a work of art only can give to you.",1
1806,"This movie is incredibly slow. It consists of repeating scenes and long stretches of silence and driving. It is a beautifully filmed movie, with wide shots predominating the screen. I also believe that if I hadn't read Uncle Vanya prior to watching this movie, I don't think I would have got the same experience or understanding of the clear parallels this movie builds its characters upon. Without knowing the theme of the play, it is really hard to sympathize with or see Yusuke's internal agony. Especially given how stiff and passive the acting is, and how the dialogue just flies by, with only a few scenes being truly formidable, the film strives for the characters to realize something about themselves and stop lying that they enjoy the status quo of something they perceive as genuine. It doesn't help that the majority of these scenes are in the third act. However, this leisurely pacing makes Misaki and Yusuke's opening up to each other more believable and natural. At its core, the movie, just like Uncle Vanya, is about wasting your life away because you are afraid of being hurt or not confronting the circumstances of your unhappiness until it's too late. Of course, the movie's finale is a bit more optimistic and actually gives the characters a bit more time to actually take the next step in their lives.",1

And it is everything, and so much more. Set in the beautiful country of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), the orphaned children build and transform their story of Liyana in ways the imagination and those with deep, challenging lives only can. The cinematoghraphy, the animations, the storytelling, and the precious, amazing children all make it a must see film.",1
1827,"I appreciated the story being in English, first of all.  The journalist with his note pad kept us informed.  Just like him, we believed that Siti and Doan were pawns.  As he wrote in the margins of his note pad, they were f****d!  The hangman's noose is waiting, and we are certain that someone must pay.  Will they?",1
1828,"This is an intrguing documentary. I remember hearing the story in the news a few years ago and certainly Korea (esp. North Korea) is well known for being incredibly secretive as far as their royalty and government is concerned. Its a good, solid documentary. I felt it was interesting in terms of the media/press perspectives, the way the legal case developed and so on. If your interested in the story or North Korea in general, then I'd recommend this documentary, yes.",1
1829,"This doc provides an interesting deep dive into the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, as well as the resulting trial.

There was enough new info in this, more so regarding the legal aspects of the case, to keep me pretty engaged. The makers loaded this thing with primary sources which is always a plus even if the eventual conclusions reached may never be proven definitively.",1
1830,"Despite being quite informative, thanks to apparent lawyers, who had provided all the evidence and investigation's time line to the filmmakers. They also inherited from them the tune of the smallest violin. Playing for two girls in mid 20's who were tricked, step by step into committing an assassination because two millennial women somehow think, that smearing baby oil on someone's face is a knee slapper, worthy to be funded by Japanese prank channels. It's really hard to even decide who should you applaud harder, North Koreans who actually made this wacky plot work or the girls for simply being too naive to not see the poopy field of red flags. I obviously think, that documentary does prove its case, that they were unaware and obviously shouldn't be hanged. But the pity song playing for these girl is too prevalent in the narrative.
I don't think stupidity should be a viable defense for a manslaughter even unintentional one. Them walking away down the road. Telling audience, that ""They learned something today"" is as phony as you can get.",0
1831,was pretty invested in first half but the resolution was underwhelming,0
1832,"It's crazy how North Korea could get away with murder and absolutely nothing happens to them. The fact that Kim Jong-Un is that paranoid about his brother somehow taking over the dictatorship is insane and he would kill his own bloodline just to make sure it never happened. I feel bad for the two naive girls who got tricked into committing the assassination, but they honestly Japanese shows do crazy pranks like that so I could see how they could get duped. However why wouldn't they question the so called directors when they commanded the two girls to make sure that they rubbed the liquid down their face into the men's eyes? That right there is considered assault and anybody with common sense should question that. I also wonder if Malaysia and other Asian airports have better cameras and more airport security. That was pretty pathetic how easy the assination was. And I hope they have signs all around the airports warning that ""TV pranks"" are prohibited and illegal so naive girls trying to make money are not duped again.",1
1833,"One of the better documentaries I've seen. It contains a lot of good information about the case and also tells the story from the perspective of the two women. The footage, pacing, and interviews were well done, although a few more people linked to the case should have been shown on screen since it was mostly limited to the lawyers, two journalists, and the two women. I initially didn't think they would be stupid enough to believe that they were doing a prank show, but the documentary revealed the manipulation from the North Koreans and the build up of pranks months in advance. I felt sorry for the women by the end and was satisfied with the take-away message.",1
1834,"A brilliant documentary feature from Ryan White exploring the assassination of the Older half brother of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  It's an Un-believable story of two women who kill with a very adept team.  It's Un-real.  It's my favorite doc of 2020.  It's told in a non linear way and it works.  Even of you know a little of this story, the detail White is able to give makes it fly and it's totally worth the watch.  It's a True Crime story come to life!  Final Score: 10/10",1
1835,"Unfolding the assassination of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2017, this is an exhilaratingly immersing documentary that unnervingly suggests our mortal means of subsistence in a foreign land could be a merciless exploitation in an absolute execution by the North Korea's Kim Dynasty and become objects of sacrifice in maintaining political relations between countries.",1
1836,Interesting & definitely recommend .......,1
1837,"Sexual abuse of minors by Roman Catholic priests is undoubtedly a serious subject, and undertakings that address it deserve to be accorded due respect. One might even say that criticisms of such works is inherently bad form. However, for director Robert Greene's documentary about the efforts of six abuse survivors to come to terms with this issue through drama therapy, the film's uneven and somewhat disorganized treatment of its material tends to bog down the flow of their story. To a great degree, this is probably due to the picture's attempt at examining far too much ground in the allotted time, occasionally making the narrative appear scattered and unfocused and giving short shrift to certain aspects. To its credit, the film's dramatic re-creations of the survivors' abuse incidents are moving, shocking and powerful, generating genuinely heartfelt emotions. In addition, a number of individual interview sequences reveal appalling details about the victimizers and the Church's manipulative practices to avoid liability, most notably drawing upon statutes of limitation to skillfully evade prosecution. Indeed, the film makes a damningly strong case against the dangers of organized religion, particularly its ploys to fearfully manipulate and control parishioners, especially among the young and vulnerable. Yet it's because of that, unfortunately, that this production fails to convey its message as clearly and effectively as it could have. A better attuned approach would have worked much better in making this the bombshell it might have been.",0
1838,"Procession is a difficult but rewarding watch. I thought this was just gonna be a straightforward documentary about these 6 men and their horrific experiences with the Catholic Church. But it was actually about these men making films to process their trauma. It was a fascinating watch, seeing how drama therapy helped these men. The scenes they film are hard to watch but thankfully are done tastefully. Overall, this is a great documentary. If you are okay with watching something very dark give this a watch. ",1
1839,The story of how these men deal with the horror and injustice of what was done to them as boys is so important but so difficult to tell.  The film told it truly and beautifully.  Its a great film.,1
1840,"It's always been kind-boggling to me how people can be so disgusting. There is no excuse or appeal ever for pedophilia. I am appalled at what these men had to go through. It's so sad and heartbreaking to see grown men break down crying and feeling violated like that.

The concept of this movie was brilliant. It was the first time that I heard of cinema being used as a medium for therapy, and I loved it. Seeing the guys helping each other overcoming each of their own demons was sweet and powerful. I do wish the movie talked a bit more about the effect or mechanism of drama therapy, as this technique should be popular. 

The pacing can be slow at times, but there were many strong and hopeful moments, especially when we started watching the scenes.

Overall, an amazing documentary that was both refreshing and powerful. 8-8.5/10",1
1841,"An attack on the Church, shows that the film was made with bad intentions, I do not recommend watching it.",0
1842,A beautiful documentary that explores shared trauma and ways to move past it. It succeeds in making you feel so empathetic and proud of these men moving on from the demons who have haunted them for decades. Absolutely essential viewing!,1
1843,"A long but harrowing and emotional look at the very brave men who took on a journey through drama therapy to help deal with sexual abuse by Catholic priests.
This film will no doubt help many abuse survivors after sharing their stories and not only those perpetuated by the church, although it highlights the pure evil that lurks amongst its ranks!",1
1844,"It is the kind of film that shakes your soul. Too bad for the last 20 minutes, it failed in be more resolutive. 6/10",0
1845,"7 Prisoners is a new important entry on Brazilian cinema. Among many uninspired comedies and badly written scripts Alexandre Moratto brings out a strong story about modern slavery.

The movie is beautifully constructed and the story is told in a manner that you stay on the edge of your seat living the moral dilemmas of the main character. This thrill is not easy to produce, specially on Brazilian cinema where acting talent is not widely available as it is the case in other places. Moratto seem to have found this talent on Christian Malheiros. Their delivery is simple, effective and it makes up for great storytelling.

This review would not be complete without mentioning Rodrigo Santoro. The arguably most famous Brazilian Actor of all time is on one of his best performances here. I concede that the role does not require extremes for the star of 300, however you just can't see an actor here. He impersonates the character so well that it is difficult to remember that it is Santoro there at times, we could just as well be seeing him on a documentary regarding these heart-wrenching issues. What a great and positive surprise it was!

With all that said, great movie! Just a small distance behind other great Brazilian works such as City of God and Elite Squad. Well worth your time. Great storytelling, great acting and important heartbreaking themes. 8/10 easy!",1
1846,muy buena pelicula 8/10,1
1847,"Com uma consciência social pouco vista no cinema nacional, 7 prisioneiros mostra a realidade crua de quem é pobre no Brasil. Impecável, da produção, direção às atuações memoráveis de Rodrigo e Christian.",1
1848,"Very Nice!!This brazilian movie shows the reality of some farmer workers that decide to go to the brazilian big city,são paulo.I love it!",1
1849,"Masterpiece and should be nominated by an Oscar
Truthful reality of human trafficking in a thrilling story",1
1850,"Acepto que me dio escalofríos. La película me iso sentir por momentos asustado. Ya que su realismo y crudeza es muy bueno. Creo que esta película puede hacer bastante por mostrar la realidad que viven muchos países.
La ambientación es buena. Y creo que los escenarios están bien construidos.
Solamente uno detalles que no me gustaron. Como que el tiempo aveces pasa super rápido y no explican cosas relevantes en la trama. O que no se da a conocer del todo el conflicto de Luca. Creo que hace bien su papel.
Pero aveces hace cosas al aire que no nos dejan ver porque las hacen.

Con todo esto pongo a 7 prisioners como una muy buena película. Creo que de lo mas distinto en netflix y de lo más recomendable del año.",1
1851,Absolutely amazing. Maybe a few minutes too short but still the beste movie i've seen in a while.,1
1852,"This excelent movie shows as explicit theme a dark side of modern slavery in a metropolis , but if you look deeper it is a smart allegory of capitalism. Each character has its role in the pyramid of work such as the workers stuck in a dead-end job, Luca as a manager but not the big boss by revealing a hidden power structure, the situations that makes Mateus jump through hoops. It's really worth watching it.",1
1853,Amazing brasilian movie. It is a real story.,1
1854,Can't wait for the next film!,1
1855,So very well animated and an incredible story line,1
1856,What I hoped it would be and more! great movie,1
1857,one the of most visually beautiful animations the cgi in certain parts just blended in perfectly wasn't obnoxious. the film was paced very well and then the fights were so amazing,1

1860,"I'm not an anime fan at all!!! I just went because my daughter is a huge fan! This movie was actually pretty cool and I enjoyed it. My daughter, however, pretty much cried through the whole thing. It was very emotional foe her. Go see this movie, it is entertaining!!!",1
1861,"Great action, beautiful story. I would have taken the kids (they love Demon Slayer) but there is suicide in the movie and that is something that we are already facing in our family. Just be aware of that in case you or someone you want to take might be sensitive to that topic. I loved the movie overall.",1
1862,"great movie, enjoyed it alot",1
1863,"So colorful, animated, great story, and just wonderful characters in general.",1
1864,"Andrea Bræin Hovig and Stellan Skarsgård elevate a story that's been told a million times. The duo play a married couple that has a major obstacle thrown their way.  Maria Sødahl's film script is balanced and is based on her own experiences.  For that reason, it's authentic and engaging.  The ending is fairly unique which may rub viewers the wrong way.  The cancer genre can miss the point, but this film is hopeful and filled with humor.  It touches on a multitude of emotions.  This Norwegian film might not be for everyone, but the leads are so tremendous you can get lost in their performance.  Final Score 7.3/10",1
1865,"A crisis can change a relationship overnight, as is the case for a couple that has been together for a long time but has grown apart over the years. The ordeal offers them an opportunity for reconciliation and redemption, but, most of all, it affords the possibility for the rebirth of much-needed hope. So it is when a middle-aged mother and professional choreographer receives a diagnosis of a terminal brain tumor, prompting her and her theater producer partner to reevaluate the nature of their relationship. It's a difficult process, full of revelations, the surfacing of brutal honesty and the rekindling of romantic feelings that have long been sidelined by other priorities. Norwegian writer-director Maria Sodahl's third feature explores what this couple undergoes when faced with such trying circumstances, a story effectively brought to life by the film's insightful screenplay and the fine performances of Andrea Braein Hovig and Stellan Skarsgard. While the picture can be a heartbreaking watch, it also illustrates that, when there's life, there's hope, a sentiment aptly and succinctly reflected in this offering's simple but appropriate title.",1
1866,"Not a movie that will touch all people equally, considering the very long still shots that might be considered boring.
But personally this movie resonated with me greatly, the loneliness, the anxiety, the passion. I absolutely love this movie",1
1867,"Ming-Liang, king of slow film ad a living legend, brings in this, his 13th film, a haunting clered-eye look at one man's loneliness shared with other young man, an interaction wich is overwhelmingly sublime and shows how aware the director is about the bleak human condition.",1
1868,"mesmerizing, best movie of the year",1
1869,I like this movie a lot. Great cinematography. Great acting. I like a slow burn and this has more than meets the eye.,1

1871,This was a fresh take on vampire movies and family that will do anything for each other.,1
1872,Absolutely boring. It should not be in the horror genre maybe closer to an average drama movie.,0
1873,"I usually side with the movie critics but, the regular folk are right about this movie. It's not good. It could have been but, the dialog and the way events unfold are just too stupid. It's a shame really because I think there was a compelling idea presented here that is marred by cheesy dialog and completely unnatural and unbelievable reactions by characters at critical points. Don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't.",0
1874,Immensely fascinating from start to finish.,1
1875,"I can only surmise that the RT Reviewers are heavily invested in this film to rate is so high. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen... not THE worst but it is BAD. A slow, drag of a family drama pretending to be a horror film. Some basic murders is all,  it is NOT a vampire film as you might be expecting. Do not bother with this. I watched it all to my dismay. I hoped there might be one thing to make the droning bore worthwhile.... there was not.",0
1876,"This movie has its moments, but that's not enough for making it stand out, for now on when I think about the definition of average I'll think about this movie, I mean, the story of a vampire that all he wanted was to have a friend? That's pretty average to me.",0
1877,The sacrifices that these two siblings made for their younger brother is a true testament of unconditional love. This is not your typical vampire movie but I loved the story.,1
1878,"Don't listen to the critics on this indie snooze fest. Unlikeable characters, bad pacing, go-nowhere plot, bad ending, the list goes on. Acting, soundtrack, and cinematography was ok, but it does not save this from the doldrums of bad vampire movies. Go watch 'let the right one in' or 'near dark' or something better a second time, rather than waste your limited time on earth with this crusty turd.",0
1879,"This is ultimately a film about sexual violence in the age of social media influencers. It highlights the artificiality of such peoples public personas and what they may have to deal with but don't share with others . Its quite thought provoking and memorable. Its perhaps a little bleak but its not choc full of gory violence or similar, thankfully, though it won't appeal to many people for understandable reasons, so be aware of the main themes when/if deciding to watch this. I thought the main character was very well portrayed by Magdalena Kolesnik. I imagine there will be many films to come about such popular 'influencers' and what they may deal with as a result of their sudden/apparent rush to fame online. The plot takes some intriguing twists and it reminded me (if slightly) of Promising Young Woman about it, although I should say that the protagonist isn't expressly out for revenge as such. Its a film that ends, if anything, perhaps surprisingly quickly at the end but I'd say its a worthy watch, that didn't feel entirely (or overly) too  over the top or exploitative, so yes I'd recommend this film.",1
1880,"An empathic look at life of a lonely influencer (fantastic Kolesnik), struggling to balance the stressful life of fitness guru, first shortcomings of newfound celebrity status and unsatisfying family life.

1882,"Sweat works with the art of empathy, the one with which director Magnus Von Horn and star Magdalena Kolesnik work and the empathy they get the viewer to feel about the central character, a woman who sees herself deshumanized by the public she works for, a public that donesn't allow her to feel lonely or to experiene human sensations.",1
1883,This movie is like Black Mirror but without the killing Ipads.,1
1884,Very good performance. The movie brings thoughts about the modern aspect of celebrities.,1
1885,"Moving and intriguing to see how von Horn orchestrates a major life theme today - the painful unconscious fears about lovability seeping out beyond superficially glamorous personas and lifestyle patterns of living out your life online, as the lead female character does. The plasma TV is indeed far too big for the room in which people gather - is part of our humanity dominated and flattened by screen-based, online living? The scenario with the bleeding, beaten up guy being sick all over the hospital reception window and floor seems to represent invisible forces stemming from wounds that are ultimately impossible to suppress. Blood and sick on the sequinned dress tarnishing the glittering appearance of pleasure. The tv interviewers' and sponsors' reactions of ikkiness and wish to disassociate symbolise a wider unease with being emotionally honest - which means a messy departure from the narrow script of achievement no-one can ultimately live up to - about psychological difficulties of living in today's surface-obsessed world...Close human connection involves risk and trauma, but, as the woman's action in helping the guy get treatment shows, is a reality deal we cannot afford to massively compromise on in the name of fame and success if we are going to stay fully human and compassionate about each other. Look forward to seeing how von Horn's oeuvre evolves further..",1
1886,"Intenso ed emozionante dramma suddiviso in quattro storie, tutte legate all'applicazione della pena di morte in Iran e alle sue conseguenze per le forze dell'ordine che sono costrette a lavorare in quell'ambito.
La scelta del regista è di costruire 4 differenti trame, tutte con protagonisti dei militari o ex tali e delle dolorose scelte a cui devono sottostare per la sopravvivenza con annesse ed altrettanto dure conseguenze.
Senza dubbio le prime due storie sono quelle a maggior impatto; due militari e due trame agli antipodi che a loro modo incollano allo schermo e colpiscono nel segno.
Le seconde due trame, pur di qualità, puntano maggiormente sulle conseguenze interiori delle scelte fatte, ed essendo poste consecutivamente dopo già un'ora di film, sono leggermente più difficili da seguire.
Film meraviglioso per accuratezza e per il rapporto tra delicatezza e durezza del mondo Iraniano.
Sceneggiatura splendida.",1
1887,"After winning the top prize at the 2022 Berlinale festival, director Mohammad Rasoulof was ordered to serve a one-year prison sentence; for producing, what the state considers, ""propaganda against the system.""",1

1889,"This is not a film for all the family anymore than it is grim faced mullahs. Nor is it, God forbid, a date movie. It is a serious, adult (in the true sense, not a euphemism) film about a very serious subject. It works as drama and asks all of us the most profound of questions. Over the years l have seen a number of Iranian films. This is by far the best. For me, a masterpiece.",1
1890,"Filmed entirely in Iran, without the knowledge or permission of the government, the film presents four stories centered around executioners who take on this task as part of their military service. Iran's enthusiasm for capital punishment gets exposed in terms of its impact on both its soldiers and citizens. Each story is well acted and coherent, presenting four different takes on the dire consequences that befall executioners and those who love them. I would give the film higher marks if the director had not so scrupulously avoided the Islamic ""honor"" killings that routinely cause family members to murder each other.",1
1891,Refreshing and tragic to hear the story from those who lived and survived the event and its sickening conclusion!,1
1892,"""Attica"" is easily the most shocking documentary I've ever seen but is also one of the most impactful. It centers on the 1971 prison uprising in New York and includes first-hand accounts from survivors. The footage is graphic and extremely disturbing but is essential to the story being told. Essential viewing.",1
1893,"A fascinating, riveting look at the 1971 occupation and resulting massacre at New York's Attica State Prison, on it's 50th Anniversary. If you ever wondered about Richard Nixon's place in history as a racist piece of garbage, watch this film and it will probably seal the deal for you.",1
1894,"Attica is a thorough look back 50 years later at the prison's darkest hour and law enforcement's unforgivable decision to massacre dozens on humans.  Racist guards, and a culture of abuse led us to one of the finer documentary films of the year.  Whether you're familiar or not, the doc using talking heads of prisoners, reporters, negotiators, and even relatives of the guards who worked at the prison.  Certainly a bit one-sided, but when one side is right and the other is wrong it could be best described as accurate.  Final Score: 9/10",1
1895,"An important, while not necessarily enjoyable, watch that painted a much different picture for me, especially when detailing events after the riot, than the sanitized version I was previously familiar with.

The primary footage is woven with current interviews and accounts from those who were on the scene, which provides a more diverse and panoramic view of the events leading up to, after, and during the takeover of Attica.",1

1897,Very well done documentary. Really explained everything clearly. ,1

1899,"This is a must see documentary. I am 61 years old, but was 11 at the time of this event and I didn't remember much about it. I am thankful that I wasn't presented with the details at 11 because it would have scarred me and removed any innocence I had left. It's horrific to watch and stays with you, but it's absolutely necessary to view the way things were not that long ago. The barbaric nature of the crime and the aftermath makes you sick. How human beings can do that en masse is beyond me.",1
1900,"Spectacular documentary, which manages to move those who watch it due to its good narrative and good editing work",1
1901,"This is very much a quirky and arty 'indie' type film. it is somewhat thoughtful - I've heard of such things happening in reality, with people suddenly suffering from memory loss - secondary school pupils in the US I think. This film is interesting in terms of the themes or concepts about identity, purpose, layers in life - like the layers of an apple, the depth of the brain or mind which contains your self identity. I'm not sure I can say too much about this film really, other than its intriguing I suppose. It raises questions and doesn't really answer them but thats kind of fair enough. I would recommend this film if your keen on European cinema, yes.",1
1902,"Surprisingly well-made, Apples is a fine example of what one can achieve despite the small budget.",1
1903,"This is a challenging but excellent watch. The Greek first-time director uses similar pacing, lighting and cinematography to his fellow Grecian director of ""The Lobster."" ""Apples"" is more accessible than the former title, with many unexplained quirks but not absurdist. The apple itself plays prominently in the lead's choices, and his struggles show through, as well as his struggling interaction with his counterpart. The Greek dialogue is subtitled, so you have to keep up.",1

1907,"Hubby and wife date night brought the documentary film 'Becoming Cousteau' which we both agreed was fascinating, but certainly not essential viewing.  It's a biopic of Jacque Cousteau and has some great footage.  Cousteau loved making ""adventure"" films and thus a lot of his life is on film.  We learn how Cousteau's vision of climate change evolved and how he was a man ahead of his time.   Hubby: 6.6/Wife: 6.8 Average: 6.7/10",1
1908,What a great documentary about an amazing Man,1
1909,"I was disappointed there were no shots of the Portuguese crew member who plays David Bowie.

In all seriousness this was a solid doc that I walked away from having learned much more than I expected to. It was of course primarily interesting in its depiction of Cousteau as an oceanographer but I also appreciated the doc incorporating events from his personal life as it gave a fuller picture of the man on a relatable human level as well.

I was also surprised and unaware how environmentally unconcerned, and even harmful, Cousteau's operations were on oceans early in his career but loved the choice to include this as it makes his transformation into an outspoken environmental activist based on his first person observations an unimpeachable call to action for us all.

*On a side note, early in the doc there was an adorable shot of a dog sleeping upside down on a bench below decks, sliding back and forth with the roll of the waves, that caused me to let out an audible ""awwwww"" and may just be my favorite scene in any movie, ever. 7.5/10",1
1910,"This documentary about one of the most famous explorers was really good. The entire crew did a fantastic job in making this documentary. This true story about the famous explorer Jacques Cousteau was amazing, inspirational, and dramatic. It gives the viewers a deep insight to who Cousteau was and what he did to save the ocean. He was a true hero and a great role model to the community. If you're a Disney+ member, you should watch this documentary sometime. It's a must see.",1
1911,"Far too graphic. I only made it a 1/3 through the movie. We see one man die on film, several bodies recovered underwater and then them hitting a whale. Which they go on to shoot in the head and is shown up close and personal. Thought this might be a great way to get my kids interested in oceanography. This was just too graphic, violent and improperly rated for them.",0

1915,"A lot of enjoyable stuff in here, even though it just feels like any other doc made for Discovery Channel or something. I never knew much about his life so this was nice to watch. Also, seeing how Wes Anderson took so much of his filmmaking for the inspiration for ""The Life Aquatic"" was fun to see.",1

1921,"A little slow but overall, ok movie.",1
1922,"What an outstanding evening!  My sons and I saw the new movie ""The Paper Tigers!""  

One son heard about the new movie on the radio. The commentary was that the movie was not a ""sell out"" and kept to the original story and actors. He told me about it on Tuesday and I ordered the tickets on Fandango. 

His Intuition was right on the money. This was an outstanding movie! Full of laughs, good comedy and great action. 

It hits on so many good points about the martial arts world.

The difficulty of training. The sparring and challenges. The super abilities that youth have.  The reality of not keeping up with training. How life, family situations and work get in the way of our past training. Lost bonds and rekindled friendships. Train or lose it. Honor, Kung-Fu family, respect and responsibility. 

So many key points. Even the filming was great. I couldn't remember parts of Seattle that looked so good.",1
1923,"RUNT
A stunning black and white silent (save the grunting) documentary that soft focuses on the life of a pig. Seems innocuous enough, but there is magic here. Shot at ground level, and sparing nothing from farm life, ""Gunda"" is not here to shock, or illicit clown tears, but to have a look, like a wide-eyed child might back in the day when summers were not filled with organized sports camps or school continuation. It captures that slow, languid, breezy feel of beautiful boredom.

Opening with the birth of a litter, it follows the towering mother sow as she clumsily deals with the runt of her offspring. It is astonishing, inviting, and then shockingly cruel. What is happening is not exactly clear, and there is no deep voice over to mansplain nature. That is the beauty of this film: it evolves along with the undetermined storyline.

A slow, dreamy bit of cinema, ""Gunda"" works well in transporting the audience to a world most are familiar with but few actually know or have experienced hands on. The sharp monochrome delivery turns a pigsty into a pleasant aesthetic. The absence of smell helps. Nothing revelatory here, and since this is a farm, well, let's just say that the animals are not in charge, and there is a sudden dramatic turn to remind everyone about life's cold harsh realities.

""Gunda"" is an animal film that is really not an animal film. It is a brilliant exercise in moment capture, shot with an addictive lens, documenting some life lessons, without preaching or dwelling on anything in particular. Pigs in showbiz are usually funny, smart or exotic. Not here. ""Gunda"" is a mother, and that is that.

- hipCRANK",1
1924,"Gunda has the power, if not to make you a vegetarian, then to at least make you think about what you are eating. This is a powerful nature documentary about the lives of farm animals, in particular focusing on a sow and her piglets. It is serene in its endearing imagery that permeates most of the film until it shocks you into disbelief with that absolutely horrific and heartbreaking closing scene. The lack of score and use of black-and-white photography made for a timeless feel to the movie.",1
1925,This is even better than the other Pig movie! Pura drama out of something unexpected. Will definitely make you reconsider your next meal...,1
1926,"Wow, uber-urban film critics strike again. This is one of those docs where critics who have no real connection or direct experience with the subject matter will find that in itself reason to praise it. So all you block-of-flats/upper eastside/downtown-dwelling types who only see pigs as pork at a shop or when watching Babe, or cows & chickens also in edible form, you see something like this and then conjure up the dubious image of the 'noble beasts' or the thought of these simple creatures as something greater than just farm animals used for human gain as you eat your Whole Foods veggie burgers and jackfruit 'fish tacos'. It's way too hipster-ick for me.
I saw all this time and time again as a kid, esp. the cows. I appreciate the nice camera work. The piglets/shoats were cute. But it's just a day on any number of farms. Let's be real. 2.3 stars just cuz",0
1927,"Really excited about this one. A voiceover free documentary about a big sow and her little piglets. Shot in black and white and very, very pure. We follow them for a year or so, that's my guess at least, and we get a one-legged chicken and some cows on screen a few times as well.

It's a meditative watch, but sadly pretty flat. I don't know what I expected, but I hoped for a bit more. Cool to have Joaquin Phoenix on board and the coolest part is that it was shot on a farm just a few stones throws away from my crib. One very obscure - brutal scene, a few sad ones, but mostly carefree animals animaling around.

6 out of 10 tractors.",0
1928,"Pure cinema, unadulterated by visible human presence.  Without dialogue or commentary, it puts the BBC films with David Attenborough in their place: the pulpit.
Wonderful camera-work and editing.",1
1929,"I don't feel like Gunda would approve of being in this documentary with no words.  Whether or not that's the message that is desired is up to you and the filmmakers.  The film didn't work for me, despite being beautifully shot.  This film is so up its own @$s.  They wanted to tell the story of how piglets are tore away from their mother, but it wasn't long enough so we added a one-legged chicken and a pair of cows.  The final act is much too exploitive for my taste.  Final Score: 4/10",0
1930,"A meditative experience and an implicit invitation to veganism. Farm animals, even in the best possible condition, suffer from what we do to them ...",1
1931,"A devastating yet subtle, and beautifully filmed story. A testament to the power of cinema. I went through several emotions watching this.",1
1932,"Loved the black and white atmosphere and the ending was heartbreaking, but no different than just sitting on a farm and observing. Also not sure how this movie is rated G given how you watch a piglet get crushed to death.",0
1933,This film is wonderful. Due by Filippo Meneghetti is a successful debut.,1
1934,When focused on the relationship of Barbara Sukowa (Nina) and Martine Chevallier (Madeleine) the film tells an elegant love story that is subtle and complex and speaks to a different generation.  When the movie goes into a bizarre subplot involving a care giver you wonder how something so delicate could be throw so off kilter.  It's a film about relationships and taking care of each other and it's charming.  The French really can speak to romance!  Final Score: 7.7/10,1
1935,"A frustrating film in that too much of the story is driven by lack of communication, silences, and inexplicable intolerance of gay love. Why wouldn't the very compassionate partner simply speak up in the beginning of the film to support her stricken partner? Why would the loving daughter be so intolerant? Why would an otherwise caring woman stiff the caregiver?  Film would have made more sense set in another time period.Lovely performances, though.",0
1936,"RATING: A+  Director: Filippo Meneghetti
Two of Us is a fantastic piece of filmmaking and it is even more astonishing when you see that this was the Directors Directorial Debut. The three Leads are all fantastic especially the main lead, Barbara Sukowa, does an excellent acting showcase. The Screenplay is utterly brilliant as is the Direction. The Cinematography is worth a mention too. On one side this I a love story on the other its real sad. It's a bit sad though that the International Feature branch at the Academy Awards didn't recognised this film.",1
1937,"This is a phenomenal film. Economical, smart, very empathetic writing combined with equally empathetic, confident directing and excellent use of tone and editing make for one of the finest films of the year, and as good a romance as I saw from 2020 or 2021, so far. That all says so much about director Filippo Meneghetti. 
Sukowa and Chevallier are truly exceptional. It's like they've embodied these roles; like two stage actors on a two year run of the same play. So authentic is their chemistry together. So glad they didn't have Mado as some flailing, mumbling mess like Hopkins in Legends of the Fall. 
Nice supporting work by Drucker and Benazeraf. 
I've seen Minari as a nominee (and winner) for Best Foreign/Non-English Language film from several awards groups. Personally, Two of Us is twice the movie Minari is; much more powerful emotionally and cerebrally. 
4.2 stars",1
1938,simply beautiful and moving,1
1939,"I enjoyed this movie, but the ""psycho"" wasn't psychotic enough for me. It bothered me, too, that no one ever mentioned the disappearance of a treasured item. Sad ending, but unforgettable.",1
1940,A moving and heartfelt story proving that love and its hardships are not reserved for teenagers.,1
1941,"How and who we love has undergone tremendously liberating changes in recent years, but, for some seniors, who remember a time when such taboos could not be revealed, the past painfully lingers on into the present. So it is for an aging French woman who is unable to tell her secret to her adult children, leaving her longtime lover on the sidelines when a tragic event disrupts their happiness and lives together. Director Filippo Meneghetti's debut narrative feature is an intensely gripping and moving work, one that grabs viewers by the collar and makes the frustration experienced by its protagonists truly palpable -- and infuriating. The superb performances by Barbara Sukowa and Martine Chevallier are riveting and heartfelt, achieving powerful impact with gestures as simple as facial expressions and piercing views into their eyes. There are a few incidents in the narrative that seem a bit far-fetched, but they're compensated for by everything else this release has to offer, already a multiple awards season nominee and a shortlist contender for best international film at the Oscars. The pain and warmth of this one must be experienced by anyone with a conscience -- or a pulse -- to see that, no matter how far we have come, there's always more ground still to be made up.",1
1942,"Two of Us is such a beautiful romance film that is uniformly strong in pacing, direction, acting performances and dialogue, but it is especially deserving of praise for its very grounded in reality, melodrama-lacking approach to storytelling that made the movie more believable and elegant. The final scene is touching and the emotional engagement here is undeniable.",1
1943,"I thought this was an interesting look inside the life of Martin Luther King as he leads his people to freedom while the FBI keeps close tabs on him. It thought it was also a dark period for Hoover plus the people of America for their treatment of King plus other African-Americans in the 60s. I look forward to Feb. 2027 when more tapes will be released of MLK by the FBI, but just seems strange we need to wait so long, similar to the JFK news releases",1
1944,I'd recommend this movie for history buffs and any civil rights activists,1
1945,"Mixed feelings on this but its key strength is the archival footage detailing MLK's life. The FBI don't come across at all well but at least we see why - the apparently revered J Edgar Hoover was a relentless decryer of any attempts from the civil rights movement to gain recognition. In context of the period it's understandable but from a modern perspective it's appalling how the colour of a man's skin marked him as a dissident simply for trying to gain equality. 
At least I got the chance to see and hear MLK in action all in one documentary. I would like to see this film become part of any critical race theory education package.",0
1946,"Extremely slow and thorough and this documentary sometimes gets caught chasing its own tail, but overall this is an enlightening look at how bad our government is in the United States.  The FBI was dirty, no surprise there, but how dirty will blow your mind.  While I enjoyed this film, it was distracting for me to not see any talking heads.  The decision to only include archive footage and audio from people interviewed recently was odd.  Plenty to dig into with this one!  Final Score: 7.4/10",1
1947,Maybe the most boring documentary ever made. No new information. Exhaustingly long. Dreadfully bad. They uncover NOTHING new. How is this not universally panned? So bad.,0
1948,"""Looking at the FBI campaigns against King, the Black Panther party, and many other people I think there's a core component to this that really is structural and functional. People hold these attitudes and we focus on J. Edgar Hoover's own particular history and person, but I think that these are attitudes that have been core to how the racial order operates in the U.S.

What helped motivate these campaigns was the real fear that black people could undermine the way the country wanted to see itself. And this manifested itself not only in the targeting of leaders and the people that were visible, but of ordinary people. So, this core fear and aggression toward African Americans has a lot to do with white people's own conception of themselves and black people forcing a reckoning with the violence of the American past.""

Hot. Damn.",1
1949,Good but a bit of a disappointment - I don't think I really learned anything..... and what was with the dozen plus clips from old Hollywood movies?,1
1950,Sobering look at how those who control our government will go to eliminate a threat to the status quo benefitting those with power,1
1951,"Horrible use of film who claims the focus was to ""shame"" the FBI for filming Dr. King but whose real intent was to cast shade/doubt on Dr. Martin Luther King's legacy. An abomination and disgrace to documentaries worldwide. Have some class, talk about good things in people and try it again! If we went after everything the writers of the film did that was bad, I'm sure we could easily frame a ludicrous picture of them as well. I'm requesting a refund.",0
1952,"Very informative, especially with all the political climate these days. I live documentaries anyways.",1
1953,"Very good archival digging but borders on being a hagiography. There was a lot of resistance to the the VU during their career from critics thinking of them as ""Warhol's pet band"" to labelmate Zappa's dig at them on some issues of ""We're Only In It for the Money"". You wouldn't know any of that from this doc that presents them as a progressive rock band too hip for the public.",1
1954,"This is an overall impressive doc on a band whose history is pretty well known to its ardent fans. Similar works on the band, Reed, Warhol and his scene, Nico, have covered most all of this history, this material before. But there is certainly quite a bit of video I haven't seen before, or at least do not recall. There's also audio speech from their time from members and Factory figures as well. 
One call always wish for more, like more concentration on the albums themselves; specific songs that are especially transcendent or indicative of a band's/act's recordings or significance. But this is fairly thorough and hits the main lines well enough.
I found Jonathan Richman annoying, though, but I often do. 3.7 stars",1
1955,I love box office man,1
1956,The definitive doc that in years to come will be inseparable from the bands legacy. Captures the essence and spirit of the band.,1
1957,"Excellent documentary for Velvet Underground fans.   It discusses the band members fairly equally with a focus on what their motivations were, how they worked together, inspirations and their backgrounds.   Includes a good deal about Nico as well.  Great clips of Warhol and some of his art films, too. It will re-spark interest in their music if you hadn’t heard them in awhile. It almost  “takes you there” to the time period and captures it’s energy.",1
1958,A pretty good documentary about one of my favorite bands and a favorite artist.,1
1959,"Better than expected - it has a narrative but a little overlong, especially at the beginning. Lots about Lou as you might expect but little from him. He was difficult to interview l guess. Glad Mo Tucker got a shout out for After Hours. That deserved to be a big record, best flat singing ever (eat your heart out Morrissey). John Cale looks miles better now than in the day when he would walked it into Slytherin. Not sure how a non fan would like this. Nor am l really sure what the legacy is. Definitely Bowie. Moontans, skinny tight everything black and shades?",1
1960,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Velvets or the 1960s avant garde art/music scene, but might be a bit boring for others. Interesting/artsy use of video clips. Lots of old video/audio clips that have probably never been seen/heard by most viewers.",1
1961,"The director of this documentary is obviously a huge fan of the late 60s avant garde movement in New York. While it was interesting to see what brought the band together, a little more time could have been spent on their later work. Most of the movie seemed more centred on Andy Warhol and his ilk, instead of the genius that Lou Reed and company brought to the table. Most of the focus is on the first two albums, then it seems like "" Oh then they made a couple of more successful albums and Lou Reed walked away. The end.""",0
1962,"It gives a new whole perspective about the importance of The Velvet Underground. In addition to incredible unpublished footage, the film contextualizes the band's emergence within an effervescent avant-garde scene of the 50s and 60s in music (John Cale disciple of John Cage and La Monte Young), literature (Lou Reed linked to Allen Ginsberg and Delmore Schwartz ), visual arts (Warhol, etc.) and cinema (Jonas Mekas).",1
1963,The best documentary movie ever made!,1
1964,"A beautifully human and moving portrait of diaspora, trauma and processing memories which is held together with incredibly emotive and expressionistic animation, albeit sometimes rigid and clunky.",1
1965,"The story moved me. The animation did not. Still, a powerful journey that will make you appreciate the fight for freedom and a mother's love and willingness to sacrifice everything for her children.",1
1966,Five stars is an insult to this film. One of the most powerful emotional experiences I have ever had in a movie theater. You forget that it's a cartoon and become completely invested in the characters.,1
1967,"Made Oscar history for earning nominations in three categories of Animated Feature, International Feature, and Documentary, it is a courageous testament, divulged only possible with the medium of animation, about an Afghanistan man embarking on a long treacherous journey to flee his country and reconciling with the slighting identity as a refuge and a homosexual.",1
1968,"Daring, engaging, and touching",1
1969,"I generally don't rate/review documentaries, but Flee is nominated for the International Feature Oscar, presented in a storytelling mode, and is animated, so I made an exception. Amin (Riz Ahmed for English dub) has lived a precarious and dangerous life. Much of his recounting comes in therapy-like sessions, but also includes his current life in Denmark. Amin fled Afghanistan with his family in the 1990s after the Taliban had taken over the country. His journey spans from the Middle East to Russia to Scandinavia, with significant set-backs — he's also gay, which, in his own words, ""Doesn't exist in Afghanistan"". The animation isn't my favorite and can even be nausea-inducing, but it does grow on you. It's a human triumph over all odds story. It highlights fanaticism, corruption, the power of family, and forbidden love. If the Academy is striking a serious, adult tone, it is a shoe-in for Animated Feature (the other noms are Encanto, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, Luca, Raya and the Last Dragon).",1
1970,"The story itself has been told before. It is like Moonlight with a guy who is a refugee. The plot felt a bit herky jerky or unnecessarily thematic at times in order to get the viewer to care. The ""real life"" scenes are stock footage and those scenes really took me out of the story. The biggest selling point is the animation, but this honestly could've been a podcast instead.",0
1971,It's an animated documentary in Danish and it is a really powerful film in a number of ways.  It attacks head on the real-life horrors of a man under the alias of Amin Nawabi.  There are recreations of some horrific situations and some that should be the better part of life.  Amin's journey of being in hiding in multiple aspects turns up as a fascinating and hopeful tale.  Final Score: 8/10,1
1972,"It is a heavy story, told in a perfectly balanced way, keeping the viewer completely hooked and terrified, but at the same time deeply inspired. The choice of animation allows the imagination to unfold, the great soundtrack fills the places and moments with infinite layers of emotions and the story itself told in the first person becomes a journey of healing and understanding that the viewer is invited to join.",1
1973,Superb. Incredible performance from Hopkins and a very realistic insight into living with dementia.,1
1974,"Anthony Hopkins makes films that fall into two categories, crowd pleasers and works of art and this film is a work of art. Sensitively told without pulling crowd-pleasing stunts we are placed into the world of a dying man who seems to be losing his mind and direction and show how this, in turn, has an effect on those around him. Simple....maybe however it will be Hopkins that you watch as you see an actor explore his role without compromise and he will yet again draw you in as he has done so often before. No spoilers. Just watch. No disappointments. Just enjoy.",1
1975,"Anthony Hopkins acting was incredibly amazing, the movie overall is a great movie that gives you a big and cruel shot of reality.",1
1976,"Good script and timeline, it keeps you hooked up. Anthony Hopkins's performance is amazing.",1
1977,"There is a strong performance here, but it is a bit predictable and often slow.",0
1978,"If only Hannibal could see this movie. Anthony Hopkins is a master at what he does, a truly emotional movie",1
1979,This blew my mind and blew me away. I went into this expecting your average family drama and I couldn't have been more wrong.,1
1980,"Enigmatic movie, not completely satisfying as far as storytelling goes - I missed the point of going to the psychologist - it didn't really add much. Ironic that the girl who looked like his daughter who died in the accident is the one who blurted out about the mishap - which probably was just his imagination of her anyway. And Paul being in Paris or in London didn't seem to work out so well. Undoubtedly, Anthony Hopkins was totally in-character - not surprisingly, his name was Anthony.",1
1981,Still traumatised by this picture,1
1982,"A very interesting and very well done glimpse into the challenges of dementia.  It's fundamentally from the perspective of the person suffering the decline.  It is very disorienting and disturbing.  As usual, Anthony Hopkins does and excellent job.",1
1983,"I never came to care about the characters, and didn't see anything I haven't seen a million times before.",0
1984,"A bit on the slow side and there was this foreboding sense that something terrible would happen like violence towards the Korean family, but they were actually quite well-accepted in the Ozarks. In fact, their major crisis was self-inflicted. And their American dream was based on specifically serving other immigrants like them - so really only the next generation would be open to due ""American"" activities. This movie was deserved recipient of various accolades, especially the Grandma actress, Youn Yuh-Jung. Too bad we weren't able to hear the interplay of Korean and English, a lot like in my family life in the US, mixing languages.",1
1985,"The best movie ever made, especially internationally! With the best acting performances from Yuh-jung Youn and Alan Kim!",1
1986,Strasznie dobra muzyka i wzruszający finał. Polecam,1
1987,Beautiful and touching story,1
1988,"Perceived as the succeeding year's ""Parasite"" but brighter, later received as something across familiarly standardized when overcoming daily hardships with character study within the familial, similarly ticking dysfunction furthered by assimilation, as well going back and forth between different generational interactions. Commonly themed regarding how it ticks and progresses but within the family's dynamic questioning further fragility and surrounded by other associated dailies that fully realize definitive idealism regarding what the American dream is about. Relatability gets tagged, but not much attachment besides how the performances tuned realism and optimism in the midst of convincing themselves that the best courses got settled, which positions us to observe and conclusively speculate. (B+)",1
1989,"FARMING ARIZONA
After a California swing, a young Korean family in search of the American dream tries a restart in Arizona. In a green, grassy expanse. In a clunky mobile home. In the middle of nowhere.

The locals are devout Bible worshippers, and though culture clashes foreshadow mayhem, ""Minari"" steers away from any such predictable plot lines and smartly focuses on the husband and wife dynamic. As quirky as the Korean family seem, it is the oddball Americans, gentle, friendly and naive, who seem out of place.

Years spent chicken sexing - looking at new hatched butts to discard the males - has Jacob yearning to live off the land. Smart, determined, driven, entrepreneurial and strong-headed, he sees opportunity whereas Monica sees hardship.

To help out, they send for grandmother Soonja. This is where the movie starts to cook. A seemingly old school traditionalist, grandma brings some of her baggage (filled with a giant bag of chili powder and anchovies), but also an unexpected eccentric zest for life. One minute she is pushing an ancient medicinal broth (cooked with goat horns she eagerly boasts) on David, the youngest, and the next she is loudly revelling in some cheesy wrestling action on the fuzzy tv.

Will Patton as a cross-bearing (literally, he drags a large cross on Sundays), speaking in tongues Christian hired hand who turns out to be a well, godsend, is absolutely sublime. In fact, all the performances are great, highlighted by Jacob's and Monica's dynamic survival dance.

The steady build up of conflict, escalated by a run of bad luck and perhaps, poor decisions, comes to an inevitable and fiery climax. Who's standing, with whom, and where, are all questions the audience is truly vested in.

""Minari"" is sweet, tough, funny, frustrating, and one of the better films out there.

- hipCRANK",1
1990,"1ya- Heart felt and well written, the film is a beautiful portrait of the immigrant experience in the south that is helmed by an unwavering performance from all members of the central family.",1
1991,"I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I have no regrets watching it. Has very simple and heartwarming storytelling. Really left a lot of interpretation at the end.",1
1992,"A beautifully crafted, gentle-spirited film that despite surface appearances is not afraid to take on the pain and difficult experiences of its characters. Centered on the immigrant experience, it's nevertheless universal in what it shows and prompts us to think about in terms of identity, family, work, and the land. That last theme - the land - and the way it is addressed here reminded me a little of Leave No Trace, a film which, like this one, is concerned to make us think about our intrinsic relationship to the land, animals, and plants, and the dangers we encounter when we cut ourselves off from this primal relationship. 

The meditation on the immigration experience is profoundly expressed; I've now lived in a country that's not the one I lived much of my life in for over 12 years, and can deeply identify with much that's shown here. The simple longings for reminders of your home country, the ease with which you miss something natives to your new country consider basic and obvious, the unintentional micro-aggressions that constantly and always remind you that you're never truly at home, and the gentle but always slightly alien kindness of a small number who strive to really love you and welcome you. 

There are significant events within the film's narrative, but big feelings and sweeping moments are not what this film is about. Although the pain and struggle portrayed is real, it remains gentle and warm-spirited throughout. Much of it felt to me like that comforting patch of sun on a cold winter's day, the loved pet snuggling contentedly into your lap, the refreshing drink that brings simple but significant joy. 

It's in keeping with this micro focus even in the midst of what may, in reality, be seismic events in the lives of the characters that the film leaves some things unsaid some questions unanswered, and some issues unresolved. That could be frustrating, but isn't; it feels in keeping with the film's beautiful, healing, undramatic honesty. All in all, a soul-enriching triumph that's whispered rather than shouted.",1
1993,Brilliant and compulsive viewing. Once your watching you are simply unable to press the pause button. Amazing film and having worked in a kitchen I know just how it felt.,1
1994,A 'one take' that actually serves the story. Bon appétit,1
1995,"What a rollercoaster! A really tense movie that also feels real & genuine. I love these « single-shot » movies (Not sure if it really done in a single shot, but I could not spot any obvious breaks) as you feel the tension going crescendo until the finale. Coupled with an amazing direction and performance, I have been absolutely blown away!",1

1997,Intense and a flawless one shot.,1
1998,"If I could give this 10 stars I would. This is one of the finest films I have seen in my life. Compelling performances, pin point accurate observation and delivery of the dynamics of a stressful service (i've worked in a brigade of chefs). This would have been enough but to film it in one take is the work of a genius. And at the centre of it all Steven Graham, such a talent, his vulnerability in this and more recent roles is so touching especially when you know what wild card rage and energy he can bring. 
Vinette Robinsons performance was also something truly special, it's the first film I've seen her in and on the basis of boiling point I think she has an extremely bright future. All the cast delivered, perfectly. Standing ovation from me!",1

2003,"""Todos nos parecemos de espaldas"", cuando se van, todos aspiran a lo mismo y todos esperan lograrlo.
Sin Señas Particulares, ganadora del Ariel a mejor largometraje y galardonada en el Festival de Sundance llega para quedarse como una de las mejores películas mexicanas hasta el momento. Hermosamente dirigida, actuada, escrita y fotografiada con un trasfondo totalmente desolador, melancólico e inhumano.
Incluso haciendo referencia al Purgatorio, al infierno y al Diablo mismo, estas de maneras sutiles y justificadas para el desarrollo de la trama, las cuales le agregan un valor narrativo muy interesante a la película.
Está llena de elementos, personajes secundarios y lugares donde ocurre la historia, y todo se siente realmente orgánico, natural y son momentos que uno como mexicano reconoce y debe tener cuidado, aspecto que yo lo definiría como tener una paranoia sana. Pero la situación por la cual pasan estas personas es llevada al extremo hasta el punto de sentirse que estas en el Infierno en la Tierra, aun así, mostrándonos que, bajo esas circunstancias, las personas aún pueden mostrar bondad y empatía unas con las otras.
Lamentablemente esta película no puede estar más lejos de la realidad y refleja realmente lo peligroso y desamparado que es la migración.",1

2008,"There isn't anything wrong with 'Identifying Features'. Highlighted by its score and cinematography, there are moments that may haunt my dreams, but it's well worth the journey.  Understated, yet tense, this feels like a fly on the wall documentary.  Very dense, it is the kind of film that may get better on a second viewing.  Final Score: 8/10",1
2009,"A story well shot and told, but far too long and slow. Newb filmmaker and writer Astrid Rondero, along with newb writer and director Fernanda Valadez - with two prior short films and this being her first full length feature film, present us with a uniquely told story, that feels as real as it gets. The cinematography is excellent, and Valadez's direction and choice of close-ups, angles, blurs, etc, make it feel like your are walking in the mother's shoes.

This is by no means anything close to a Hollywood-style production, but instead uses tons of scenery and some flashbacks to tell an eerie story, as you travel throughout the film, in the mother's shoes. The casting and performances were plain with nothing exceptional, albeit feeling that much more authentic. The score was subtle and fitting.

My biggest issue was that a normally comfortable 95 min runtime, felt like 3+ hours with the forever-long and dragged out (and in most cases unnecessary) scenes. The pacing couldn't be any slower. I get that the filmmakers were trying to get you invested in the feel for the story, but there just wasn't enough substance to fill 95 mins, even if the pacing was fast. I'm sure many can handle slowly paced films, but I'm not one of those people. I feel at least 40 mins could/should have been trimmed off - bits here and there from pretty much every scene, and the pacing sped up, and it would've been an outstanding short film, told in the same manner, just faster without making the viewer (me) impatient. You can pretty much fast forward 70% of the ""traveling"" portions, and end up with the same results.

Nevertheless, and outstanding production from newb international filmmakers, and it's a story that needs to be seen, told in its unique way. If you're patient, you will love this film, but it wont be a ""must see again"" film. It's a 7/10 from me.",1
2010,"Deeply powerful and emotional. A closer look at the horrors thousands of families have to go through while living in a corrupt, violent, and unsafe country, through the eyes of a desperate mother trying to find her missing son. A living proof of how far a mother's love for her child can go, representing hundreds of thousands of other mothers out there.

Fernanda Valadez just made one of 2020's best films. I'm pretty excited to see what she'll do next.",1
2011,"When the teenage son of a middle-aged Mexican mother goes missing while en route to the US to find work, she's determined to find out what happened to him, despite official reports that he was killed by gangs roaming the country's rural highways. Her perilous odyssey proves to be quite an experience, more incredible than she ever could have imagined. Such are the makings of this chilling, sinister road trip mystery through the wilds of rural Mexico, one that literally and symbolically portrays the evil inherent in the nation's crime crisis. Although the film drags a bit in the middle and occasionally has inadequate subtitling, the picture's closing act provides quite a payoff, one that, like much of the production, is depicted with exquisite, if unsettling, cinematography. Director Fernanda Valadez's debut feature is a meticulously crafted offering that provides viewers with an inside look into a deeply worrisome problem, one that should give pause to anyone watching it -- or considering a trip through the Mexican countryside.",1

2026,"It will never cease to amaze me how adults feel entitled to bully and harass kids. That TERF at Andraya's track meet. That dad at Mack's TX state girls wrestling championship. They booed him like a heel in a WWF match. But Mack is just a kid. Andraya and Terry are just kids. Sarah is just a kid. The so-called ""adults"" spitting venom at these kids is monstrous. TX sticking to their ignorance and not allowing Mack to wrestle with the boys is just awful. But these kids are the lucky ones… their families have embraced and celebrated their children. 
I loved this movie. I have so many trans friends, and I worked in an LGBT medical clinic. They just want to be themselves. I have seen many conservatives realize the error of their ways when they discover their child/parent/best friend/family member is trans. I just wish that conservatives could learn to respect trans people without having to have one in their family. The lack of empathy and compassion by people who claim to be Christian is breathtaking. Ignorance breeds fear. Fear breeds hate. One day they will learn to be as compassionate as the composite fable of the ""jesus"" that they follow.",1
2027,"Anytime you have a chance to educate yourself on an issue, it's important to learn as much about that subject as possible.  Transgender teen athletes is the topic in a film that was ahead of its time by a couple years, but totally relevant in the moment.  The film is a little too heavy handed in showing which side to be on and if you can get past that there's a lot of good here.  Discrimination comes all too easy for too many.  It really is interesting seeing NON Cis white males arguing AGAINST equality.  People are all entitled to be happy by living their truth and the truth is, High School athletics should be about competition and not about winning.  If that was the case all of this drama caused by the people who are all too comfortable in charge, would not matter.  Anyone who disagrees with the filmmakers's point of view was made to come across as mean or dumb or confused and frankly that isn't right.  There are several really good points on the other side and even one was made in the movie, only to make the dissenter look silly moments later.  If you're opposed to people having equal rights this won't be for you, but if you have an open mind and are hoping to educate yourself give 'Changing the Game' a try.  Final Score: 7/10",1

It is pretty uplifting to see mental illness portrayed on screen because you usually get caricatures of mentally ill people in movies but definitely not here. ""Paper Spiders"" is a fantastic story with amazing acting, pacing, dialogue, and a brilliant ending.",1
2040,"This reminded me of Lady Bird but was so much deeper.  It is basically a masterclass in acting and story. I'm really glad I watched it, because it totally immerses you for almost 2 hours. There are no false notes or beats, and it leaves you thinking about it afterwards.",1
2041,"Very moving. Those who have a loved one suffering from a mental disorder will feel heard by Paper Spiders. It is a heartfelt story with an emotional impact. Even though the main actress Dawn is presenting symptoms of delusional disorder/paranoia , the manifestation and downward spiral of her disorder is painfully relatable to anybody. Thought this was a timely and relevant film… If only there could be more like these.",1
2042,"Paper Spiders is a vivid display of what it's like to not only live as someone diagnosed with a mental illness but also what it's like to live life as someone close to a person who deals with mental illness. Additionally, the film touches on some other prominent issues like teenage addiction and recovery. This movie is very close to my heart due to providing such an authentic portrayal of the mental health experience from a variety of angles. It is both relatable and eye-opening. I would highly recommend watching it whether you have a mental illness or simply know someone who does.",1
2043,"A superb documentary, Mayor is well worth a watch",1
2044,Really engaging film. Surprisingly funny at times (literally laugh out loud).but more often rage inducing at the injustices of the Occupation and the unfairness for people who just want to be allowed to live their lives with dignity.,1
2045,"This is a harrowing look at the dire situation in Palestine mainly through the eyes of Musa Hadid, mayor of Palestinian city Ramallah.  It's just unreal to live anywhere freely and not be free.  I didn't know a lot about this situation, but by all accounts it's sad and mostly bleak.  Let's hope for peace and understanding.  This was a really good film that I'm sure it just touching the surface of what's happening.  Final Score: 8/10",1

2055,"Brilliant. Among other things, this is one of the best depictions of human evil that I've ever seen on screen. And yet, not a single shot is fired.

The film is set in Argentina in 1980. A right-wing military junta (backed, unfortunately, by the US) is in the process of kidnapping, torturing, and murdering thousands of civilians. But you wouldn't know it from this movie - except from anxious, oblique references - because the social class the film depicts is (almost) completely insulated from the violence that's done to protect their interests. Still, there's tension and dread beneath the surface, from start to finish.",1
2056,"It's one of those typical movies that movie critics salivate over. The tension that all the reviews allude to comes from pointless dialogues and long silences and those long shots that's supposed to represent the character's loneliness and internal turmoil. For most part the dialogues are stiff and theatrical, it just feels like a play for most of the time, and a really pretensions and boring one. The main character looks like he has a constipation for the entire movie. This should have been a TV movie at best. The pretentious references to The Heart of Darkness like traveling down the river to meet the baddie is just that - pretentious references.

The only quality comes in the last 5 minutes but it doesn't justify the dreadful 85 minutes that supersede that.

It tries to be like Friedkin's Sorcerer (especially using that transistor music which in this movie really feels fake and forced) or Antonioni&#39;s The Passenger. It&#39;s neither and doesn't come even close. If you want to watch a good movie about that disappearances in Argentina at the time of the military junta watch Costa-Gavras' Missing with Jack Lemon. This is just a poor, student's tribute to 70's political drama.

I&#39;m giving it 3 stars because there are movies worse than this. I thought about giving it 1 just to correct the rating because this film is absolutely nowhere 10, 9 or even 8. Critics giving it 100/100 is just a joke...",0
2057,"If you have a soft spot for a classic build up with a vintage twist in the mold of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, you'll absolutely love this. One of the most exquisite thrillers in a while.",1
2058,"Good lord, this was painful to sit through. I don't know what the critics were looking at.  The music/sound was jarring to the extent that sometimes I thought I was hearing noise from adjoining theaters bleeding into mine. The primary actors, I guess, were representing the emotional pulse of bankers, wives of bankers, friends of bankers, etc., but my God, that didn't warrant making me sit through two hours watching them.  I began to fidget throughout, as I kept waiting for something of interest to happen. Others will call it, ""... a quiet, unhurried, un-flashy film..."" or ""a real white knuckler."" I would call it just plain boring!!!",0

2060,"FISHY BUSINESS
""Luzzu"" starts innocently enough with a solitary fisherman plying his trade, and though it touches on a wide variety of big topics - fatherhood, tradition, working-class struggles, Brexit - as well as a thoughtful character study, it never loses the charm of the opening minutes. A story about a third generation Maltese fisherman, played by an actual Maltese fisherman, not only feels true, but has a warm vibe only good fiction can bring. You can almost smell the sea breeze.

Stamped with his baby footprint, ""Luzzu"" is the colourful family boat passed down for generations, that serious family man Jesmark Scicluna puts to sea on a daily basis. Trouble is the fishing industry is morphing into an unsustainable one, for the little guys anyway. A new born with special medical needs, and thus costs, puts a strain on the family, and Jesmark is asked to consider a career change.

Squeezed by big fish, various restrictions, and cutthroat, often illegal competition, this really is a lone man vs. the sea tale. While Jesmark's decision is a life altering one, and deftly describes the current political situation of many smaller European strugglers, it plays second fiddle to the personal trials of the defiant fisherman. A man of few words, he carries the weight of his world on broad shoulders, seeking to hold on to his heritage right to the breaking point.

Though forced to play the new game in town, a seemingly beaten Jesmark closes the movie with a moving parable to his infant son. A story about a boat, which over the years has been patched up so many times that very little of it remains, but yet, it still remains that boat. ""Luzza"" is a clever and affectionate tale about conflict, struggle, family, and the determination to retain one's humanity. A winner all around.

- hipCRANK",1
2061,"Better than just passing time.  A story of the confluence of environmental issues, government regulations, and the laws of the marketplace on a charming, but antiquated, culture.",0
2062,"Luzzu is a Maltese drama film directed and written by Alex Camilleri which portrays the dying fisherman industry in Malta.  When boiled down, there are a lot of parallels to what goes on in America. The acting is great, the cinematography adds to the film's authenticity.  The girlfriend arc is shoehorned and the scenes didn't contribute to the film's emotion.  There's a scene late in the film that is just heartbreaking.  A very fine film! Final Score: 8/10",1
2063,Absolutely beyond perfect. Incredible character development of a changing industry.,1
2064,"While the narrative of this engaging Maltese offering may seem somewhat familiar (at least superficially), there are plot developments that defy formula and take the film in unexpected directions. Add to that the picture's fresh locale and little-known subject matter, and you've got a truly intriguing release. But what's perhaps most impressive about this debut feature from director Alex Camilleri, a nominee for the Independent Spirit Awards' Someone to Watch Award, is the strength of the performances he's managed to evoke from a cast consisting of many nonprofessional actors, including protagonist Jesmark Scicluna, winner of the 2021 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Award for Acting in the Dramatic World Cinema competition. In dealing with powerful universal themes like tradition vs. progress, weighing the expediency of need fulfillment against the preservation of moral values, and knowing when to hold on or let go, all as seen through the lens of the Maltese fishing industry and the struggles of a young married couple trying to manage the challenges of being new parents, the film paints a captivating picture on a variety of fronts, one that never becomes muddled and succeeds at wrapping up all of its story threads by movie's end. ""Luzzu,"" the Maltese term for a traditional, brightly colored, wooden fishing boat, has thus far largely flown below the radar, playing primarily at film festivals and in limited theatrical release. However, as one of the better films in an otherwise-disappointing year at the movies, this is definitely worth your time now that it's available for streaming. Indeed, this is one fish story you won't want to miss.",1

2068,"Meticulously researched and detailed, this film explains and documents the horror subgenre.

I guess if you are into folk horror to the degree that you are a folk horror nerd- you may like this movie. However, I learned from this one  micro genre of movies that I will permanently avoid.",0
2071,A lot of documentaries that cover multiple films at once struggle with being too cursory. Woodlands doesn't have this problem and thoroughly engages with the rich themes in folk horror.,1
2072,"At 3 hours long this is a comprehensive and well put together documentary divided into manageable sections. It is extensively researched and very well put together. it covers the impact of pre-christian folk lore and its impact in the genre of Folk Horror in film. There are interviews with directors and experts on iconic films such as Witchfinder General and The Wicker Man and 200 other films. It also acknowledges the impact of writers such as Nigel Kneele and his influence upon storytelling. There is also an interview with Geraldine Beakin from the Atlantis Bookshop. This is the most comprehensive study on this genre and manages a feat of being comprehensive, informative, and absorbing. Highly recommended.",1

All in all, an excellent example of what documentary film can be:  engrossing and informative, all the while decorated with amazing animated interludes and a haunting soundtrack.",1
2075,"Interesting and informative documentary, ""Woodlands Dark…"" is engaging and, while coming in at over three hours, it is split in to stand alone sections that make for breaking it up to watch over more than one sitting. The film does skew more towards expounding on folkloric horror in specific films, especially British films of the 1960s and 1970s, with some good historical contexting. It loses steam and depth in the second half when its focus moves to folklore and horror in American and other cultures, thus the 3 1/2 stars.",1
2076,"At first, I felt that this documental was only about how this kind of films have evolved through the time, but it's going deeper and deeper and instead of reaching the deep, it reaches the surface, showing us how this film have been based on the past and the present has been based on that films indirectly. It digs all the Folk Horror Films of all the world and how they relate to important events of the history of every single country, from México to Australia. Finally, the last comparison with the life modern is obvious, but never analyzed and that leaves you a lot to think about considering the global situation.",1
2077,Watched on the movie channel. Be warned this movie enacts statutory rape. The acting was decent but the plot and ending definitely could have been better. The whole time I was waiting for her to tell the trainer that she was pregnant with his baby and she was going to keep it. That would have made the ending better as she walked away because that would have been the end of his career.,0
2078,"Very arty, long shots of the girl's unhappy face, and from the start it was obvious this was going to be about sexual abuse. Seemed almost like it was going to be soft porn. I stopped watching after about half an hour, because it was so obvious what was going to happen, and the long ""atmospheric"" shots of the girl staring into space seemed artificial and self indulgent.",0

As a vehicle for addressing an important social issue (especially in the sports world), ""Slalom"" hits all the right notes (albeit somewhat predictably at times), and it conveys its message in a release with fine acting, excellent skiing footage and beautiful cinematography of the French Alps. However, the film begins running out of steam (and direction) in the final act, with ""nuance"" being euphemistically passed off as a lack of defined focus. Director Charlene Favier shows much promise as an emerging filmmaker in this debut narrative feature, though, based on this work, it's apparent some refinement is in order for future projects.",1

2086,"Hive is the best Albanian-Kosovan drama film I've ever seen.  I think it's also the only one, but it's still not bad!  Written and directed by Blerta Basholli in her directorial debut, 'Hive' tells an age old tale of war and does so in a subtle and heartfelt way.  Based on a true story, the feature ends up being an uplifting jolt for the empowerment of women, young and old!  Final Score: 7/10",1
2087,"There is a lot of intense politicization of Kosovo from both sides that many people forget to focus on the region's social problems, such as extreme poverty and immense misogyny. Hive is a drama that lifts the veil on these issues by dealing with them head-on. On purely cinematic levels, the movie is too ordinary due to its plain cinematography, serviceable directing and a lack of any score, but it succeeds as this subtle, character-driven drama powered by a terrific central performance from Yllka Gashi.",1
2088,"When the madness of war mercilessly tears families apart, the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, a process that can sometimes be more complicated than one might expect. So it was for the women of Kosovo in the wake of the tiny Balkan republic when it was bombarded by neighboring Serbia in 1999, a conflict that resulted in the ""disappearance"" of many of the nation's husbands and fathers, leaving their wives and mothers to carry on. But their efforts were often thwarted by a misogynistic culture that prevented them from earning a living, even despite the absence of male breadwinners in many households. Director Berta Basholli's fact-based debut feature tells the inspiring story of a group of women who defied the barriers in setting up their own company selling honey and ajvar, a relish made from red peppers and eggplants. This moving tale explores the challenges of starting a business under difficult conditions while trying to keep their families together an dealing with the grief of lost loved ones. The filmmaker hits all of the right notes with this offering, most notably in the superb performance by Yllka Gashi as the beleaguered but defiant protagonist. With world events being what they are at the moment, this outstanding release reminds us all too poignantly about what we face in the wake of these misguided catastrophes and the difficulty of coming back from them without an abundance of courage, fortitude and determination.",1
2089,"This is a small masterpiece of cinema.  It is excellent and innovative in many ways.  Heartwarming but not super sweet, it deals with sad themes of loss of loved ones, and maltreatment by survivors.  It shows women to be superior in many deserved ways, and is a lesson to all on dealing with the adversities in life.  The technical aspects, from story telling through camera work, and all other crafts is first-class and very realistic.  Bravo to this first-time director.  Hopefully she will have a wonderful career.",1
2090,"Hive is a sobering, very important drama that is very understated but yet incredibly effective. An Albanian-Kosovan production the film tells the true story of Fahrije who is trying to survive in the aftermath of the 1999 Kosovo War. Her husband is missing and more than likely dead and she has to figure out a way to survive with her two teenage children. They live in a small rural village where cultural prejudice is very strong. Many women have lost their husbands and yet they are not expected to work or even allowed to drive cars. It's a deeply paternalistic society that puts immense strain on the women living there. Fahrije ran a honey business with her husband but now it's not really making any money. She turns to producing ajvar, a local condiment made from peppers. Slowly, against the odds, she starts to make it work with the help of the local women. This is a gripping drama about perseverance and inner strength. Living though grief and trying to survive. Yllka Gashi is superb in the lead role, she brings tremendous humanity to her part. This is a small film, with little fanfare. But it has a very important story to tell.",1

By a quirk of fate l was able to identify what was happening in my life at the time depicted in the film. I thought l was having a bad time. Man, oh man. A couple of other thoughts. It's impossible to watch this and not think about what is happening in Ukraine. And you cannot escape dark thoughts about Serbs, Russia's only European allies. Nor l am afraid, can you not think about how ineffectual Dutch troops on the ground were. I know the political context of the UN was terrible but if l was Dutch l would feel shame.

… made even more urgent amidst the Russian war against Ukraine! The indifference masked as collaborative action is startling, and so weak. It continues to cost lives

To my mind, I've seen only one other wartime film as harrowing, stark and shocking as QVA, and that is Schindler's List. Of a different era, telling of a different genocide, it is as impactive, and sadly shows a number of similarities to WWII

It goes without saying that only the highest level of government approval would have permitted this access at this critical time so it seems a little over rehearsed. I also felt the filming was excessively close to the subjects which may have been an attempt to act as a constant reminder they were being filmed.

Things jumped around a bit too much without enough information to fully follow along.

2122,"For those of you who have not watched the film, this was a highly intriguing, well acted cast ensemble with plot twists that kept you at the edge of your seat! Bravo! I wouldn't call this a 'horror' movie genre but more of a psychological thriller with sci-fi elements. And, the film Title did not really fit the script, yet the poster picture captivates attention.

For those of you who Have watched the film, I left 'spoiler' critiques below. Here's where I thought the film lacked believability and plot development...

1) Why is it that the protagonist, Nolan, has no other friends or family to support him through a very difficult, near-death experience and tragedy? Why is he left to raise Ava alone? Except for his doctor friend, Gary, who is left to help fill in the blanks while Nolan suffers from supposed Amnesia and an identity crisis. 

2) It is even fathomable to believe that Thomas' wife and child would stay living in the same apartment building where Thomas was killed? Especially after you find out who pushed him down the stairs and why.

3) You know something's up when Dr. Brooks (Phylicia Rashad) keeps blowing up Nolan's phone to get him into her controversial dream experiment lab to help him restore his memory. As soon as you find out that it is Dr. Brooks dead son's mind she had implanted into Nolan via the Black Box, and is now desperate to bring him back to life (like a Mary Shelley Frankenstein monster), the movie starts to make more sense. Except why would Dr. Brooks want Thomas to go back to his wife Miranda who he complained was holding him back from becoming the doctor his mother always wanted?! And why would Dr. Brooks want Thomas to resume his old life after his wife was responsible for his death?! It is of no surprise his 'abused' wife wanted to erase Thomas from her past and move on to raise their daughter in peace. 

4) Why didn't Dr. Gary Yeboah go to the apartment to investigate after Nolan gave him the address? And why didn't Miranda contact Dr. Brooks (her past mother-in-law) right after receiving a chilling visit from Nolan-Thomas? If you knew your abuser was revisiting you from the grave to resume his role in your life, wouldn't you want to confront the mother-in-law and expose her unlawful experiment?! If we had more background info about Miranda's relationship with her mother-in-law, and whether Dr. Brooks knew how abusive her son was, it would have shed some light into the movie. 

5) We all love the bone-cracking, blurry-faced manifestation that keeps attacking Nolan in his dreams and eventually reveals itself in the end.  This is the climatic part where Thomas must choose whether to remain as Nolan and keep his daughter Ava or fight for his life back as Thomas to please his mother. It's a highly moral decision to make and one that had to be made quickly in the end. The news story that exposes Dr. Brooks unethical experiment, and shuts down her lab was predictable and sloppily done. And... Who reads the print newspaper anymore??! As Miranda sits in that same apartment at her kitchen table smiling at the fate of Dr. Brooks, you wonder if she had any moving boxes ready to get the hell out of her own nightmare!",1
2123,Excellent movie has relatable characters and a lot of mystery and twists I would def recommend,1
2124,Interesting plot shot like a horror movie... what an experience...,1
2125,i didn't watch it but i know i hate it,0
2126,I know most people don't like this because it is closer to the story of Mulan and not as close to the animation Mulan. The artistry in this movie was great and it told the story in a more straightforward way.,1
2127,"It is not charming (mainly because it is PG13), the characters are ultimately either unmemorable or unlikable, and it also has no mushu. Some might say it is because it is faithful to the original poem, but no. I have read the poem before so if Disney wants us to believe the movie was faithful to the original poem, I'd say it is more faithful to 1998 Mulan and is therefore 99% bull****.",0
2128,"If you are comparing it to the original you are going to be completely upset, they took out all the good, funny, and joy from the movie. As a movie itself, it was ok, Mulan is a superhuman. You aren't emotionally involved, the story was out of place, the witch was completely pointless. In the movie is Mulan's father had gone to war he would of been sent home because the chief sends home anyone to doesn't live up to his expectations. The villain wasn't scary or intimidating, He had a few pointless scenes as well. There was probably like one short action scene that was cool.",0
2129,I really liked this movie and have watched it a few times. I totally understand why changes were made from the original and the direction they were going in. They wanted to focus on different morals. I would say the only thing lacking was time. If they had more time they could have built more connection with the other soldiers which would have been amazing. I'm sad that it was received badly. I think the director did an amazing job.,1
2130,"This just isn't worth the watch. I'd recommend going back to watching the Original Mulan Movie. Even the mediocre Mulan II at least keeps the charming animation, making it far better than this awful remake.",0
2131,"The fact Disney even thought this was passable is an insult to every single fan of the original, and the fact they wanted $30 from people on release is a crime against humanity. This is an embarrassment of cinema.",0

2135,"With almost ahome-made movie, legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog returns with this, an exploration of human connections, deffending its place as one of the best films of the year and, also, as the best fiction movie Herzog has done in a too long time.",1
2136,"An astonishing film on so many levels. That Werner Hertzog does not speak Japanese is just one, yet he has managed to pull off something practically impossible and make it look easy, unlabored, and beautiful. It is an innovative and creative masterpiece. Japan is forced to stand on the leading edge of technology in order to solve challenges of high population and lack of natural resources, and the rest of the world must soon follow. I recommend it highly to anyone who knows and appreciates Japan, and to anyone else looking to understand the relationship between technology, human identity, and connection.",1
2137,"With a topic as if created for Werner Herzog, this (fictional) story is slyly presented in his unmistakable documentary style with lots of amazing and surprising moments.",1
2138,As customary way the director had dared to explore the unseen. This time his microscope has gone through one of the Japanese subculture somewhat bizarre in rest of the world but not to Japanese themselves. Great movie as the rest of Werner Herzogs',1

Excelente fotografía y banda sonora.",1
2142,"Hubiese preferido un documental a una película. El tema es de no creer para nosotros, los de occidente. Japón vive en una sociedad muy distante a la nuestra, el tema de alquilar actores para hacerse pasar por familiares o seres queridos es increíble. Herzog toca muchos temas existencialistas en la película pero no se llega muy a fondo en ninguno. Interesante, pero no de lo mejor del gran Herzog.",1
2143,The twist is really good on this one.,1
2144,"For once I agree more with the critics than the audience: this film is better than its (very limited) commercial success suggests. The story of a soon-to-be stepmom who gets snowed in with her soon-to-be stepchildren doesn't give away its solution till the end...and keeps surprising even after that. The movie also offers -shall we say- unexpected events, not just jump scares, and all three major characters do a fine job in the acting department.",1
2145,Sad and intriguing. Well worth seeing.,1
2146,Meh seems like the director purposely lagged the acting bc there wasn’t enough story,0
2147,Not a great movie! I wish I would have watched different one.,0
2148,This movie was very intense. Its not like a lot of cookie cutter horror movies. It makes you think constantly and question what you are seeing. Definitely a new spin on a story. It made me want to give my infants a big kiss when I got home because of how it ends. Dont see if you dont like thinking while watching a movie.,1

2167,"This movie has some cool ideas, and with a better story and structuring it could have easily been the next Deadpool or R rated 70s Superman, but unfortunately that wasn't the case and instead we're left with something that resembles the defecation of James Gunn's 'mental breakdown' feature SUPER, i.e. this film is a steaming pile of dog poos... and not even Joe Manganiello's delusional drunken performance can save it.",0
2168,"I like the fact that it tries to do something different and subvert expectations of a superhero film, and there are a few very cool ideas, but at the end of the day, despite Joe Magnellio's committed performance, ‘Archenemy' falters with its writing that not only lacks direction, but also depth. There were at least two interesting main directions this could have taken, but in the end, despite taking ideas from each of them, it never manages to find an impactful way to present them.",0
2169,"Wow, what a stinker. Bad on so many levels.",0
2170,"Joe Manganiello plays an awesome homeless man in this. It makes me want to go and listen to the stories of homeless people in exchange for alcohol. He captures the dream we all share of being something greater than what others see in us. He didn't need to take this role, but the fact that he did impresses me with his acting prowess and willingness to make a great movie, even if it's to DVD and no the theaters. 

The story leaves you hanging until it explains everything towards the end... with a twist. You really wonder if this guy is a bum or a hero and it could easily go either way. All the hero stuff is shown in animated format, so it's easy to think the guy is just drunkenly daydreaming of being a hero. And it fits so well as that. It's not like Space Jam, where cartoon and reality just don't belong together... this is the mixture done right. 

All in all... this is a very good breath of fresh air from the typical super hero movie. It's not just worth a watch, it's worth owning.",1

2175,"honestly, not as bad as i expected it to be. but also really not that memorable.",0
2176,This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be a cut-and-dry teen horror flick. It is WELL worth a watch if you are in the mood for something spooky,1
2177,"What brought this under the radar is the theatrically attending pursuit amidst lockdowns' limitations, over its acknowledged reputation via critical reception that gives off an impression towards praiseworthy significance. It delivers as expected through intense, quiet thrills typically building up jolts in a diverting pattern whilst being another to embrace mise-en-scene to subtly add on to the frightening energy on alert. When it's not in the horrific mood, it calms naturally for wholesome characterization that eventually at least serve a twistedly realized perspective. But the thrills are sporadic with gory disturbances and unnecessary interactions in between including inefficient lengths. Even if you take those narrative obstacles away and improve the courses even a bit, it'll still remain original that'll really offer a scary ride. (B)",1
2178,"Pretty good and entertaining. Not really scary but there are creepy parts. I'd say overall its pretty fresh, I liked that it went in directions that weren't so predictable. The suspense is good that's one of the better things this movie does. Characters can be dumb sometimes and a few times make poor choices, and there are some plot holes. If you're looking for something interesting to watch, this is a good selection. However if youre looking for something scary then this isn't it.",0
2179,Smooth camera work and creepy makeup.,0
2180,Maybe…just maybe…someday a horror film will be made where every scenario isn’t based on the characters making one stupid decision after another. This movie had potential but halfway through I just ended up rooting for the evil force to kill every one.,0
2181,"Despite the nice filming, the story falls flat with its characters. Main character is like a worse version of Matt from A Haunting in Connecticut for the most part. Everyone is one toned, and it's hard to invest in any of them.",0
2182,Just not good. Lost interest about halfway in.,0
2183,"I thought the sequel was good and kept the story interesting overall, but not as good as the original",1

2186,"Lara Jean is back and is now officially with her hunky boyfriend from the first film. However, enter a new handsome stranger who comes across another letter, romantic comedy high jinks ensue. It's all super predictable and formulaic, but it's also sweet and pretty irresistible. I also love that the romantic lead of the film is played by an Asian actress and that it's not a plot point either, which is rather novel and not often seen in TV or film. On a related note, I also get equally excited when I see Asian characters who are bullies or jerks (like Reggie on ""Riverdale""), since Asian characters are usually nerds or some variation of Long Duk Dong from ""Sixteen Candles."" But back to this film, even if it has zero surprises, it's movie comfort food. If you liked the first film you'll very likely enjoy P.S. I Still Love You.",0

2189,"I thought it was really bland, especially in comparison to the first one. It's very obvious that the director of the first one didn't direct this one. The first one was very fun and cute while this one felt like it was trying too hard to be serious. There are a lot of really dark shots, which make the film feel really gloomy. The protagonist is far more unlikeable in this one than the last one due to how she handles a certain plotline. The film also doesn't seem sure of how to adapt the book that it's based on. There are a lot of plotlines that feel incredibly rushed, and a lot of scenes that don't seem relevant. To summarize, it wasn't a very fun experience, and it lacked direction.",0
2190,Good fun movie with a cast that worked well together.,0
2191,Didn't live up to the quality and humour of the 1st movie and to be honest wasn't a worthy follow-up to the original. Everything seemed forced and the vibe just wasn't there.,0
2192,"I still like the characters in this series, but unfortunately this movie just didn't quite grab my attention as much as the first. It's still entertaining enough for a watch and I'll probably still watch the sequel, but it's pretty clear the original story worked better here.",1
2193,"This is probably a good film, but all the symbolism is lost on me. Beautiful country where this was shot, I'll give it that. And the acting was top notch. Plot, meh, idk, it was ok. Raffey Cassidy plays the protagonist and is on a bit of a roll with this her 4th movie in a row with good reviews (Allied, The Killing of a Scared Deer, Vox Lux). Michiel Huisman plays the creepy Shepherd and does a fine job being creepy. The supporting cast was not anything to write home about but didn't ruin the movie either. I can't really recommend to the masses but if you are a movie buff it's worth the watch.",0
2194,This is an example of a great story with a lot of  potential to fly high but never took off and ended up landing disastrously.,0

2196,"Beautifully shot but far too slow and ultimately simplistic in its themes. Men bad, women good, etc.",0
2197,This was weird but I mostly liked it. It's basically like The Witch meets Midsommar but I liked it a lot more than either of those which I'm sure is a wildly unpopular opinion!,1
2198,"An unapologetically dull waste of time. Roughly 5 minutes worth of plot (if it could be called a plot) stretched out over 90 minutes. This film strikes me as the result of someone having had The Handmaid's Tale described to them by someone else with a dirty sock stuffed in their mouth, shouting the plot from the next room, and the writer thinking ""I guess I'll make that?"".",0
2199,"6.75/10. It walks the line between artistically fanciful and annoyingly pretentious, but great acting and a lean screenplay pull this cult-story back from the directors ostentatious albeit visually appealing whimsy.",1
2200,Lots of pretty shots for ultimately no pay off and an unsatisfying story,0
2201,"My God this film was slow to the extent it was B--ORING! Its been a while, I have come across a film where every shot felt like a painting and still, I found myself struggling to get through with it. The whole film was a bunch of looks and stares, cult singing and roaming around. A perfect example of a wannabe arthouse film going wrong totally from a writing standpoint. Heavy-handed messaging, virtually nothing interesting going on. Kind of a film where minimum dialogues wud work wonders to move the story if they are written purposefully. When I was finally able to finish this arduous film, I can't help but thinking that I watched a pretentious dud, an interesting premise could have been much more with better writing.",0
2202,"Sadly, I found this just another one of these unbelievably dull, style over substance borefests, that masquerades as an 'arthouse' picture about something 'important' when it's actually more like a 97 minute advert. Quite how they managed to make a film set in the woods about a cult containing no drama or tension whatsoever is beyond me. Just so fed up of people thinking they're making a decent film just because they have an important message but clearly seem far more concerned with making everything beautiful. If you really cared that much about the message you're trying to convey then you wouldn't get sidetracked with all of the 'pretty pictures' and you'd make sure the story was told. Too much of this nonsense being made at the moment, give me a plot and some drama someone please! (Rant over)",0
2203,Very fun. Good story and characters. Great tension.,1

It should, because they've been filming this script for at least four decades.",0
2205,This movie will give me lifelong PTSD,0
2206,"This movie turns into a ""horror movie"" at the end , like the last 20-15 mins of the movie. No point of all the drama. The first part of the movie was entertaining though. They could have turned this into a thriller/suspense movie, would have been better. The ending just ruined everything.",0
2207,"Fucking horrible. Worst I've ever seen. Seriously...I am putting this at the bottom of the list of horrible movies of all time. The best part of the movie was writing this review. Franco, I expected better than thus. You go think about what you've done.",0
2208,"Terrible plot, bad acting, terrible ending, just a bad movie",0
2209,"""The Rental"" is entirely predictable, but manages to be enjoyable all the same. The casting and acting was more than adequate, the pacing was well done, but something about the lack of surprises and cliche nature makes it difficult to rate more than 2.5 stars. This movie knew what it needed to communicate and did so in a timely fashion. Many directors should take note, longer films are not always better films. The runtime was just right with little to no fluff. This film does a lot right, but fails in every way to chilling. I am a jaded and callous audience, but have been spooked by creative and unnerving thrillers, this just isn't one. Dave Franco shows promise, and I would give this film a much better rating had it succeeded at being scary. 
SPOILERS: I appreciated the that the deaths followed one another in quick succession. No drawn out bullshit or unreasonably long chase scenes. The concept of a murderer hiding in your home, air bnb, or other dwelling is a bit played out. I would recommend this over many others of that genre, though that says more about them than this feature.",0
2210,"All criteria of a hilariously cliché, contrived horror film has been met. Dear Franco, I want my time back. Thank you.",0
2211,"Terrible.  Every single character is unlikable, horrible, and makes every single bad decision possible. It's really frustrating to watch. The ending is unsatisfying and stupid.",0
2212,"This movie spends wayyy too much time on character development, rather than the actual horror aspect. The only watchable part of this movie was the final 30 minutes; which still leaves everyone unsatisfied",0

Who's alive, who's dead? All the maybe deaths and funerals were heart wrenching.  But making me emotional doesn't make this a good movie. I feel they wanted to mimic the confusion a severe head injury can cause, and they certainly succeeded and making it disorienting.",0
2224,"Beautiful story of love and loss, grief and regret, and how sometimes the mind can defend itself in usual ways. Sienna Miller and Diego Luna intertwine their respective characters seamlessly and believably without overdoing the emotions that come with life. Tara Miele takes her shot at her first major motion picture and hits a home run. The film deals with heavy issues with a deft touch and closes the circle at the end. Well done, recommend for everyone not just buffs.",1
2225,"Haunting depiction of trauma and grief, and the extent to which our mind protects us from the devastating truth.",1
2226,"Wander Darkly is a pretty fair film about a couple Adrienne (Sienna Miller) and Matteo (Diego Luna) who are struggling with there relationship. When an accident leaves them in a trauma. Where they face the past and current conflict with there relationship. They try to resolve there conflict that is holding them back.

The plot i can not say much more without going into spoiler territory. It was surprisingly good. A car accident affecting them both. Such as facing life after death. Dealing with loss and grief. And how a humans mind work itself in dealing with trauma. Adrienne and Matteo are dealing with a troubled relationship. Where they test each others love for one and another.

It is an emotional movie. And has a twist that will keep you guessing til the end. Diego Luna and Sienna Miller did a great job with there roles.

I did find the exposition being too dragged on. And slow in the end. But it is a wonderful film.",1
2227,"I do not like fantasy movies that deal with love, so I did not even finish the movie, thus my *2* star rating!!",0
2228,A story to fall in love with. Good storytelling and strong acting make the journey both mesmerising and enlightening.,1
2229,"Beautifully shot and well edited, ‘Wander Darkly's' visuals are the most interesting thing about it and work wonderfully together with the story that blends romance with supernatural elements to create something more engaging. It's different and I appreciate what writer/director Tara Miele was trying to do here. That being said, it stagnates in the middle act, and whilst Sienna Miller and Diego Luna are both fantastic in their roles (in particular the former who anchors the film and delivers a superb depiction of the various stages of trauma) as flawed individuals struggling to make a relationship work, the fact that they seem so incompatible becomes more and more frustrating as things progress and ends up impacting the ending heavily.",0
2230,"Wander Darkly is a truly fascinating film. A film that is both soulful and experimental. It's an ambitious film that manages to pull it off mostly. Adrienne and Matteo are a couple experiencing strife within themselves despite having a child and a home together. While driving away from a party, their arguing causes an accident that leaves them hospitalized. At this point the film goes on a trip that involves their past and their separate and combined memories. We never quite know where the truth lies but it never gets actually confusing, a testimony to the direction and the great editing to make it all work. It's a visceral film where emotions run high and the memories play tricks. Thanks to great performances from Diego Luna and Sienna Miller the emotions are real and centered. A very clever film where execution matches ambition.",1
2231,"Writer-director Tara Miele's leap from TV to feature debut is essentially a love story with a touch of the supernatural. When the film begins, it's obvious something is not right in the relationship between new parents Adrienne and Matteo, played by Sienna Miller and Diego Luna. One accident later, the film begins retelling their love story via a fluidly executed narrative mechanism that flits between two possible states of mind: is she dead or is she just concussed and confused? To an extent, it's your typical examination of two people falling in love and eventually deciding to live together and have a child, where everything in between is then reassessed with a certain amount of hindsight. The film has something intriguing, if not insightful even, to say as it charts how the couple is challenged as the passion slowly burns away and external forces and pressure intervene. Despite a few clunky dialogue (if you have a shot every time Matteo asks Adrienne do you remember something, you'd be drunk half-way into the film), Miele maintains an effective and mysterious surreality as the film transitions through scenes, time and events, keeping it all dreamily atmospheric while constantly propelling the narrative forward on different levels at the same time. Miller is a solid lead who anchors well and her Adrienne is sympathetic and understandable. In films like this, the best resolution is one that's hidden in plain sight, something that makes sense yet might not have crossed the audience's mind. Even though my suspicion as to where the film was heading is proved correct, I was satisfied with the ending because I didn't feel cheated by it, even if it turns out to be a different and sadder film than I first anticipated.",0
2232,"Heartfelt drama with an ambitious dreamlike style.

Writer and director Tara Miele's surreal romance drama Wander Darkly (2020) is quite moving if you have patience and empathy enough to lose yourself to its dreamy surrealism. Tara Miele is a director to look out for as her creative vision with her endearing script and flowing direction is captivating to Wander Darkly's entire quick 97 minutes. Miele's direction feels similar to Tree of Life, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, i'm thinking of ending things, Inception, Interstellar, and Shutter Island. It's a curious way to shoot a romance drama story while weaving in and out of memories, but Wander Darkly really works. You're absorbed by each scene without ever quite predicting the endless twists. Tara Miele's writing comes across as realistic marriage drama dialogue, existentialism, with hopeful conversations and conclusions. Wander Darkly is satisfying and a curious picture like few others.

Sienna Miller absolutely steals the entire film as the adorable and endearing Adrienne. She's devastating as I really felt for each emotional disturbance or sweet memory with her. Her subtle facial expressions display a genuine understanding for her character's unique suffering. Sienna Miller is phenomenal in Wander Darkly with her nuanced performance. I like her as an actress ever since I was stunned by her beauty, wit, and charisma in Casanova with Heath Ledger. But Miller is particularly touching in Wander Darkly with a grounded sense of pain and love within her intimate acting. Diego Luna is fantastic as Matteo in one of his best dramatic roles in Wander Darkly. He plays the concerned husband, estranged spouse, and loving boyfriend. He feels gentle and sincere, while also hiding something.

Vanessa Bayer is cute and likable as Adrienne's close and supportive friend Maggie. Aimee Carrero is gorgeous and playful as Matteo's flirty other woman Shea. I wish Bayer and Carrero were in Wander Darkly much more to flesh out their characters a bit. Beth Grant's stern and obstinate mother Patty is excellent. You hate and sympathize with her immediately. Brett Rice is good as Adrienne's father Steve, who just doesn't seem to know how to handle his daughter's emotions. Tory Kittles is pretty good as Adrienne's potential other man Liam with his charming personality.

Editors Tamara Meem and Alex O'Flinn cut seamlessly in between dream sequences with fluid pacing and natural motion. Their sleek editing pairs nicely with Carolina Costa's cinematography. Costa's shots are gorgeous in breathtaking wide shots and visually creative close-ups. Her perspective choices are varied and inventive with a pleasant moving camera that flows around the central characters with a warm empathy. Katie Byron's production design allows for esoteric cold hospital hallways and genuinely cozy homes alike. Christopher Lawrence's costumes are pretty modern with an authentic contemporary appeal. Sienna Miller looks stunning in every dress and outfit combination from Lawrence.

Alex Weston's score is so light and romantic with a mesmerizing fantasy feel I really loved. Wander Darkly already looks incredible with vivid colors and bright lights flaring into faces, but alongside Weston's ethereal music, I was swept away to those lovely Mexican sea waters.",1
2233,"The movie does a great job of portraying pain, acceptance, fairness, forgiveness, and dignity.",1
2234,"Recent revelation from a classic source helps reflect on the film's flowing direction besides being theatrically faithful to its material as much it could via cinematograph presentation for performative deliverance maintaining the sense of emotional realism by time. The core theme of grieving over a loss that was relatively written allows Vanessa Kirby to walk in a depressing trance ticking upwards a raw performance at her realized best outside certain blockbusters, alongside Shia LaBeouf's rare emotional strength plus the rest of the cast providing generationally sympathetic heft and casual professionalism. (B+)",1
2235,"Too slow, scenes too long. Vanessa's acting is great but its a film you never want to sit through again.",0
2236,"I loved Shia in this movie. His complete and utter feeling of uselessness after death of daughter is profound. It is also a depiction of selfish millennials who know everything and accept no other truths. It was very close to, I imagine, what a mother and father feels after such a loss. Ellen Burstyn also excellent. They deserve all the alcolates.",1

2254,"There are several things to admire in 'Tommaso', namely being the performance of Willem Dafoe and the brilliant cinematography.  There is plenty of Dafoe who often gets his close up and thrives in almost every instance.  The problem with this is two fold.  There's essentially no character development as everyone stays the same.  That can be find if we have an enjoyable narrative which we don't.  I mean the best way to describe this is a film that has many branches, but no roots.  Still if you're a Dafoe completist, you won't want to miss it!  Final Score: 6.3/10",0

2257,"This overlong, meandering character study about an aging American actor/filmmaker living in Rome with his young wife and daughter as he attempts to build a new life in the wake of wild younger days characterized by irresponsibility and substance abuse never quite hits its stride. The film offers no definitive answers to his dilemma -- in itself a refreshingly blunt and honest characterization of his circumstances -- but the inclusion of considerable easily edited extraneous material, as well as fantasy sequences that don't always work, makes for a tedious slog, leaving the viewer waiting for something profound, moving or significant to happen that never does. Director Abel Ferrara's latest obviously is personally meaningful to the filmmaker (an attribute made apparent through the fine lead performance of Willem Dafoe), and its cinematography and production design make for a visually interesting offering. But a lack of focus, a pretentious, myopic narrative, and an overall self-indulgent approach can't save a release for which resisting the temptation of the fast forward button is indeed quite a challenge.",0

With a very strong performance by Paul Bettany, the movie is entertaining, compassionate and very heartwarming, despite some of its darkest and heart-wrenching moments. An engaging story that should have been given more visibility, because of its important subject-matter and its beautifully sweet ending.",1
2273,"After seeing what Amazon suggested, I can say ""no""! Horrid movie.",0
2274,"Very cute comedy with touching family drama.

Director Alan Ball's indie comedy-drama Uncle Frank (2020) is a very straightforward, yet nuanced picture about a kind gay uncle supporting his progressive niece find her way in life, while dealing with his own demons. Uncle Frank is incredibly funny, then leans into genuinely moving drama. I simply loved Uncle Frank and hope you get a chance to see it too. Ball's open direction is very positive with his sweet gay romance drama and heartfelt coming of age drama all mixed with a lighthearted comedy vibe. He also deals with Southern intolerance of homosexuals with a darker grit that's surprisingly haunting for the dramatic flashbacks. Ball has a sleek and effective style. 

Alan Ball's writing is delightful. His wonderfully supportive characters bear a cute humor and realistic feelings. I like how natural his old fashioned Southern family feels and how modern the New York characters come across. He balances perspectives fairly with a real respect for the gay community and a kindness for those with addictions. Uncle Frank flies by for a very quickly paced 95 that still finds time to develop complex characterization.

Sophia Lillis is astounding as always as Beth Bledsoe. Her pleasant manner and sweet personality is fun to see as the progressive Beth finding her way in life. Lillis is sincere and caring with every subtle moment of understanding or shock for her beloved Uncle Frank. Sophia Lillis is utterly fascinating and so cute as Beth. I found her comradery with Paul Bettany's Frank so supportive and kind hearted. I hope Lillis gets more lead actress roles like Uncle Frank as she's captivating.

Paul Bettany is seriously impressive as Uncle Frank Bledsoe. He is initially supportive of his smart niece Beth as her favorite Uncle Frank. Then, Bettany opens up as a gay man, guilty of his own sexuality because of his homophobic father, as he struggles with his own sense of self. Bettany had me crying at the graveyard and lake scenes when he's utterly devastating. Paul Bettany can really play anyone.

Peter Macdissi's hilarious Wally is immediately lovable and funny with a nice sense of self. He's openly gay and supportive of Uncle Frank is a realistically patient manner. He steals the show with his fun loving personality and earnest dramatic acting. Steve Zahn's ignorant Southern brother Mike Bledsoe is shocking in his depiction of casual racism and sexism, but he feels real. Judy Greer is lovely and hilarious as Kitty Bledsoe. Her bubbly personality comes across beautifully. 

Margo Martindale's understanding mother to Frank was a nice supporting actress role. Stephen Root is terrifying and understated as Frank's brutal father Big Mac Bledsoe. Lois Smith is fun as the hopelessly ignorant Aunt Butch. Jane McNeill was a nice opposition to the Southern family's ignorance as Frank's supportive sister Neva Bledsoe. Caity Brewer and Hannah Black's nieces were both funny.

Khalid Mohtaseb's cinematography is quite gorgeous with these stunning wide shots of barren forests and intimate close-ups of characters mourning or being wracked with guilt. Darcy C. Scanlin's production design crafts older wooden South Carolina homes and 70's New York apartment spaces with a sound sense of the era. Kevin Hardison's art direction neatly focuses on open flower fields, barren forests, expanses of lake water, to tighter home spaces for those confined to a small town feeling a claustrophobic sensation. Amy Morrison's neat set decoration finds all manner of period specific things to adorn these 70's households.

Composer Nathan Barr wrote a pleasant and soft score that keeps things light and close to the heart. His music fits Uncle Frank nicely. Megan Stark Evans' costumes create a realistic aesthetic for 70's clothes that don't just fit a hippie or yuppie stereotype. Sophia Lillis' dresses are very cute like her short sleeve shirts. Lindsay Irish-Desarno's make-up gives Paul Bettany a completely different look. His haircut to his mustache transforms Bettany into Uncle Frank.

In conclusion, Uncle Frank is a charming indie comedy with very moving drama.",1

2277,"At times cringe worthy and not a fell=good movie in spite of the ending.

Its a nice enough story for the most part though and the cast do an alright job, with some nice themes. Its an ok watch but I wouldn't recommend going particularly out of your way to see this. I thought it seemed more like a TV film or an extended TV show, rather than an all out film as such, although I did like the last scene before the credits, which brought home the fact that it is a real life movement as it were.",0

Its more sad than it is funny, so I'm surprised its categorised, in part, as a comedy - there are some light hearted moments in it I suppose but its more a depiction of a dysfunctional family at large than primarily an idyllic rom-com. I thought the cast did well and its an interesting watch. It became quite moving after about an hour, when things take a somewhat more dark turn. I think Sally's performance is reasonably memorable and I'd recommend this film to fans of hers. A key word relating to this film and the main character is fragility.",1

2309,"A little difficult at first, but it is well worth the time and money. The film is seen entirely through the POV of Jane (Sally Hawkins), a paranoid schizophrenic, who sees her world entirely in the present, in a sort of chaotic, non-chronological manner. Sally Hawkins so completely inhabits her character that the mood shifts and hallucinatory scenes pulled me into Jane's mind and heart so readily that I was won over. I highly recommend Eternal Beauty.",1

We are reminded the sum of our parts are sometimes worth more than we are, that when we are most vulnerable those sworn to protect us may decide not to, and chemical dependency can lead people down remarkably strange paths.  The musical score beautifully accents the playfully dark themes and comedic mundane dialogue.  Angela Bettis was simply brilliant.",1
2327,I didn't realize it was a comedy & Thriller movie so I wasn't super happy at first but as the movie developed it turned into a rather entertaining movie. Not only were the characters well written and like able. It was a chaotic yet hilarious ride to pass the time.,1
2328,Absolutely fantastic. It kept me engaged in ways I didn't think possible. Every character feels too real and too crazily insane at the same time. It's hard not to identify with Mandy even if your life is not big much of a mess. This film was written with the kind of sensibility only a woman can have towards certain subjects. 'Show don't tell' done very well.,1

2335,"Margot Robbie is fun, but this slogging excuse for a girl power movie did nothing to help my opinion of the DC cinematic universe. Jokes fell flat, there was little chemistry among the actors, and the Message was heavy-handed in delivery.",0

2346,"Unbelievable script, horrible acting, very weak dialogue, and that was the good.  Kept waiting for all of the above to improve but it never did.  Do not waste your time or money.

2367,If you ever wanted to know the lengths people will go to get out of Buffalo this movie represents it perfectly.,1
2368,"I expected this to be a low budget film with amateur actors. The movie was far better than what I expected. The story was well told, directed and had an excellent cast.",1
2369,"I first became really aware of Zoey Deutch in her scene-stealing turn in the 2nd ZOMBIELAND movie.  She just popped out of the screen because her energy was wild and it was DIFFERENT somehow.  She was in the role of ""airhead blonde"", but made it feel different and not like a cliche.  Now, a year or so later, I see her in BUFFALOED, and my opinions of her were reinforced and enhanced.

She plays Peg, grown daughter in a very poor household who is obsessed with making a lot of  money (and getting out of BUFFALO).  She's willing to study and go to school to get her way; but if there are less ""legal"" ways to get there, she's not adverse to doing that too.  Her moral compass is askew due to her very bubbly, upbeat but manic desire to have a lot of money.  So this compass gets her imprisoned at an early age, and when she gets out, she has trouble finding a job.  But one day, she takes a call from a debt collector, and ends up taking a job AS a collector.  She goes to work for one of the many collection agencies in Buffalo (who knew Buffalo was a big hub for this shady business?).  But eventually, she simply has to strike out on her own, because the money isn't coming in fast enough.

Deutch's Peg is empowerment personified.  She is strong, independent, super smart, willing to work hard and never takes ""no"" as an answer, especially from men.  What a great role model!!  Yet at the same time, she's amoral, selfish, and honestly more than a little nuts.  What a terrible role model!!  And Deutch juggles it all because she brings this crazy energy that's both appealing and horrifying.  I've never seen a character quite like Peg, and I doubt anyone else could have done her quite so grippingly.  It's a amazing meeting of great actor with a perfect character.  I could have watched her (and her insane clothing) all day!

Right there, I recommend the movie...just to see her in action.  However, I wish the movie itself was better.  Tonally, it's all over the place, veering awkwardly from comedy to drama to romance to violence.  The other characters are  mostly underwritten and fuzzy.  Noah Reid (Schitt's Creek) plays Peg's brother...his character and his character's decisions are all over the place because no motivation or real character development is provided.  Jai Courtney plays the ""bad boss"" of the big agency.  He's a terrible actor in a cliched role.  The results are a villain we just can't care about.

The filmmaker is also trying to teach us about shady debt collection, but this comes across as a clumsy version of THE BIG SHORT.  It's an important topic, but generates little outrage (or even clarity) in BUFFALOED.

In the end, see the movie for the explosive performance of Deutch.  It's worth it for that treat alone!",1

At the halfway mark, I was regretting ever putting this film in my watchlist and contemplated turning it off, but I stayed only because I enjoyed some of the other background characters and figured I'd wait the film out to see the end results.  The main character tries and tries to impress and be funny and while a bit charming, she mostly just comes off as an eye roll.  Plus, a story about a highschool girl becoming a music journalist literally sounds like the most boring film.  There's definitely better films out there that deserves your attention rather than this cringe fest.  P.S. regarding the ending...... I can see the gesture was coming from a place of love... but bitch, no one wants your fucking hair.  I can't express enough how self indulgent this character is.",0
2377,"Super cute, I really liked it!",1
2378,"I was so looking forward to seeing this but was so disappointed. The titles say ‘based on a true(ish) story', and that's the problem – it just wasn't a very interesting story.",0
2379,"I think what I liked most about it is the concept.  It feels like Beanie Feldstein's Ladybird variation. 
Other than that, it feels a tad fast paced. I would have loved to see more of an exploration of her family life and her relations with the people around her. Still, the flurry of acquaintances and thoughts that she goes through is definitely more in line with what a 16 year old girl would be thinking. I like that she goes through a series of highs and lows, it manages to really present that point that she's trying to make about reinventing one's self over and over. 
In the end, it's a pleasant watch with the occasional fizziness, but I wouldn't call it memorable (unlike the protagonist's look which is absolutely so).",1
2380,"Slow and rambling. Being offbeat and quirky works only if the script, editing and direction are consistent and coherent. If not, then the result is a dreary piece of cinematic stew and this one had too much gristle, short on salt and too much lard.",0
2381,To weird for me. Never really felt like I knew the characters. ,0
2382,Boring dreary incoherent box ticking nonsense but a decent bit of shirt-off.,0
2383,"Why is this film so underrated and under-appreciated? One is tempted t think that if a story about the origins of, say, an American gang were told this creatively and engagingly that we'd have heard much more about it. 

Central to it all is, of course, George MacKay, who positively consumes the screen with an intensity that is both thrilling and frightening. That he manages to do this whilst still allowing us to see vulnerability and fear is truly an achievement. 

But MacKay is not the sum of what is good here. I know little of the history of these events, and nothing of the source novel, but this manages to parallel the way toxic masculinity infects both a family and a nation from inception. Mix into that cocktail colonialism and you have a truly dangerous DNA. 

The direction is inventive and powerful, the supporting performances clever, the strange score at times unsettlingly discordant and the cinematography touches the breathtaking. Brilliant, moving, powerful and exciting, this is an excellent achievement in its own right and one that promises much more to come from many involved.",1
2384,"Racconto suddiviso in 3 parti, in stile ""Moonlight"", perfettamente in grado di rappresentare i due diversi schieramenti di pensiero riguardo al vero personaggio di Ned Kelly.
Purtroppo mancano i giusti collegamenti tra le varie sezioni, alcuni personaggi tra cui quelli di Crowe e Hunman scompaiono senza il finale degno di nota che si sarebbero meritati.
Le ambientazioni sono molto particolari, a tratti si nota che non tutte le scene sono state girate in Australia.
Nonostante questo i colori e la fotografia rendono giustizia ad una storia sporca, cruda e senza lieto fine; peccato aver limitato a pochi minuti gli ultimi mesi della vita di Kelly in prigione.",1
2385,Try to look at this film as fiction than actually history. This movie is more of a character study of Ned Kelly and his separation from being civilized and non civilized.,1
2386,"This movie spends an inordinate amount of time going absolutely nowhere.  The various protagonists and antagonists are more caricature than thoughtfully developed characters and, without such developed characters, the movie just plods along.  All of the time spent trying to tell the story of how Kelly became the man he was, and at the end of it all he is the same question mark to any audience member who did not grow up on the Australian stories of his escapades.  Documentaries have told a far better tale.",0
2387,"The True History of Ned Kelly (rental) has a a great cast and a director who is trying to dry hump his own artistic merit.  Film rambles incoherently around Ned Kelly's life with lots of strobe lights (in 1860-80).  Punk rock music blares...all of Australia cross dresses.   The English are bad.  The Irish are good people ...and bad horse thieves and murders.   Ned Kelly has the good idea to wear amour ...Forgets that the English know how to make fire and get most of his family and friends killed.   The performances deserve a better film...only for die hard ""I will watch Irish people kill English people for any reason"" crowd.  2 Stars out of 5 mostly for the side characters.",0
2388,"A lot of reviews here say they liked the first half with  Russell Crowe but it went downhill after that.  For me it's the complete opposite.  I thought the first half was a pretty ordinary, boring story about a family struggling for existence in the outback.  But the 2nd half took a surreal turn and became a lot more interesting.  Not a great film but I did enjoy it.",1
2389,"Absolute stinker of a movie, the ""artistic shots"" detract from the movie which is already in enough trouble due to a whole host of unlikeable characters, crap dialogue and the general feeling that nothings really happening. instead of watching this, watch literally anything else or failing that perhaps think about cutting off a finger as it'd give you far more joy and be MUCH more interesting.",0
2390,"Top notch war film. Tense, and vintage Tom Hanks .",1
2391,"I was absolutely captivated by the portrayal of the technical aspects of commanding a convoy escort destroyer in WW2. Tom Hanks brings to life the minute by minute, split-second decision making that must take place to keep the convoy safe, preserve his ship, and carry out his duty. Even in those split-second decisions, you can see the intense concentration, thought and balancing that needs to take place in the Captain's mind. I found the CGI seamlessly integrated with the live action photography that took place on an actual WW2 Destroyer. Needless to say, the presentation of the action at sea was one of the best ever in that the depiction of the movements were realistic and a revelation as to the limits of surface warfare against submersibles.  Overall it was an eye opening experience for someone who is a huge Military/Sci-Fi action fan. This is comparable to Das Boot from the Destroyer Perspective.",1
2392,"Just an exceptional war movie.  If anything, I wished the running time was a bit longer.  Tom Hanks gives another fine performance and worthy of an Oscar ""nod nom"" but snubbed again!  Greyhound has made my best 30 war movies of all time with this fine effort and is well rounded and well directed!  I thoroughly enjoyed this last night.",1
2393,"Thought it was very good well worth watching , very much like The Cruel Sea,  I do think it could have done with more of a backstory to Tom Hanks character though , great to see Stephen Graham in it a really good English actor, just watched it for the second time,  apart from that all in all very good .",1
2394,"Just amazing. Thank you to the greatest generation, they are why we are the greatest country on earth!",1
2395,Beautiful movie and excellent cast.,1
2396,Brilliant movie that I have rewatched at least 6 times. Totally engaging from start to finish. Sad that covid stopped me from watching it in the movie cinema.,1
2397,Awesome movie! This movie is a great action war movie. What makes this movie so great? Non stop action with no woke progressive message or undertones. Just a good old fashion war movie with tons of action.,1
2398,Excellent action filled movie. Tom Hanks is exceptional once again.,1
2399,"I really wasn't overly impressed with this film. Don't get me wrong, Hanks does pretty well in the main character role and its perhaps worth seeing for Stephen Graham in a film role (with an American accent, which I have to say I wasn't entirely convinced by - at one point I could have sworn I heard an ounce of 'scouse' (as in scouser talk, people from Liverpool, England speak scouse and he's from there) from him but that shouldn't come as a massive surprise) if not for anything else.

I thought the start was pretty cheesy and predictable and it just comes across as yet another naval battle film. It is quite short, duration wise, which is no bad thing - too many war/battle type films can go on for seemingly mind numbing durations, though I admit I'm not someone able to keep myself from being distracted easily. What bothered me most about this film was that while its pretty fast paced and could be quite gripping, I felt unclear about precisely what was going on - it'd help to have a good knowledge of naval tactics I suppose, as I didn't really feel particularly 'in the know' about everything. We hear the main character, Commander Krause, giving out orders frequently and the shipmates 'aye, aye'-ing them all and scurrying off to carry out said commands. We see the water around the vessel and get perhaps a rough idea of what may be going on elsewhere but it still left me feeling unclear about things. I imagine it would have been reasonably atmospheric if seen on the big screen ie a cinema, rather than at home via a streaming service - Hanks is decent enough in his role but there's just not quite enough character development or extra context type info. provided to really add that extra emotional level to it. 

I also couldn't help but wonder how likely it is, i.e. the feasibility of what happened. I won't say anymore. This is very much an ok watch - not especially remarkable but its ok. There were certainly some decent explosions and other visual effects like that but ultimately there isn't too much to it really. I wouldn't especially recommend it, no. Oh and maybe its me just being silly but I somehow assumed this film was going to be about a bus driver - I was thinking of Greyhound coaches I suppose! yes the poster is a pretty big clue but I found myself thinking I heard the title Greyhound and it being about Tom Hanks driving or captaining a vehicle, so I assume coach/bus. Ah well, that just goes to show, what do I know(?!).",0
2400,"I really wanted to like this, but I could not get over the lack of reasoning why the couple was in that middle of nowhere to begin with. It detracted from the rest of the story and I just could not suspend my disbelief to enjoy this one.",0
2401,One of the weirdest movies you can ever encounter. If you look beyond the appearances this picture is able to provide you with a creepy and realistic depiction of human sadness and grief. My rating: 8/10,1
2402,"Ultra-violent, surreal, Groundhog's Day: three words to describe Koko-di Koko-da. The film underwhelmed and became repetitive — I know, that's the point, but it didn't do it well like Groundhog's Day, Palm Springs, or Edge of Tomorrow. Mog (Peter Belli), the boater-hat-wearing, cane-wielding, ring-leader of the sadistic trio (+ 1 live dog, 1 dead dog) was the best part of the film. It touches on grief and trauma, but not in any way this reviewer is able to articulate. Midsommar and Another Round were both Scandinavian smashes and I was hoping this would be an addition to that echelon, but whatever message it was trying to make fell flat. It's nowhere near the mindless, gratuitous torture porn of Funny Games — a movie I loathe — but had it run thirty minutes longer, we might've gotten there. The shadow puppetry was cool, so if you enjoy shadow puppetry, this movie might be for you. Koko-di Koko-da wants to be edgy and smart when it's really just a time-loop horror, which might be exactly what you're looking for.",1
2403,"The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. The puppetry is gorgeous, and the folkloric characters that illustrate the metaphor at the end are particularly effective. The slow pace is no huge bargain, but after the fact, it left me with a strange mythical feeling. This movie is not completely satisfying, but strong in its defiance of following convention. It's original, that's for sure.",1
2404,This was very slow for the first half and I gave up but I watched a second time and glad I did as it was quite good. Very creepy. There was really no explanation for any of the strange events but I'm not sure if it mattered.,1
2405,Best film of the year!,1
2406,"An old-school Swedish grief-parable and pretty baleful. I'm not sure I'd recommend it; it's not as clever or emotionally moving as it thinks it is but it is grim. Couple grieving for their dead child are subjected to a cycle of weird torments by a group of surrealist fairy-tale psychopaths in a wood. 

It's not as horrible as 'Funny Games' or 'Antichrist' by far but it shares a similar dreary, circular ambience. Cool shadow-puppet sequence in the middle. Cw for several dead dogs.",0
2407,A very unusual mixture of elements which ultimately work surprisingly-well together.,1
2408,"I think the critics view movies through a weird social paradigm, instead of actual entertainment.  The scores on this movie are a perfect example.  I know it's been slow during the pandemic but holy smokes this is bad and no you aren't hip or artsy if you think it's great.",0
2409,Unsettling. Vague. Not really sure what i was watching at first but little by little became more clear. Still not enough character development and few plot tension or actual scares could not manage to bring the arty bizarre show to stronger territories that would have made it one piece of a kind movie...which in a way still is but not enough to stick with you for long.,0
2410,"Jahi Di'Allo Winston shines in a complicated role and Charm City Kings is an off the radar gem.  Other than a 3rd act turn, the film is generally a completely plausible one.  These types of movies haven't been made for all races and it's about time there is one focusing on the city of Baltimore and how hard it is to make something of yourself in this place called America.  It's not perfect, but for a complete culture this film should have been seen by tens of millions not tens of hundreds.  It is a really good inner-city coming of age drama with a few laughs to keep it going.  It is based on a documentary on the dirt bike and motorbike scene in Baltimore.  It is well worth the time.  Final Score: 9/10",1
2411,The greatest 02 hours: and 05 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
2412,A great movie about the youthful pursuit of genuine freedom and expression. It's a big bad world that awaits a young man. But this cleverly acted out and well made story let us witness how a young man's future shapes up when met with a web of cross roads.,1
2413,"Great acting, powerful story and great pace of story telling. So much better then I thought it would be.",1
2414,This movie does not take viewers into urban street bike culture as the title and previews would suggest. The first real glimpse into that world comes during the closing credits.,0
2415,Very well acted and engaging movie.,1
2416,The movie sadly falls in all the coming of age in the suburbs cliches without bringing anything really new or fresh to the tables. The characters are pretty as stereotypical as the setting and it is kind of a shame because the performances are effective and there's a great work done in the directing with very nice riding shots and a good sense of editing. Not special but enjoyable...sometimes it's enough depends on your mood.,0
2417,Great drama with a lot of meaning to it. It seems to unfortunatly have truth to it and happens to a lot of kids across the world. I think it gives perspective to kids who grow up not having to worry about money.,1
2418,"Come on critics. I know it is Netflix but come on. This movie is ok but nowhere near 60%. The story is lame, acting is ok but not great. Camera work is on a highschool level. Same movie with different actors would get 30%.",0
2419,"This movie was so good, really liked pretty much everything about it . It’s only once in awhile you get a great performance from kid actors . All three were perfect in this movie and even meek mill was awesome 4.3. I felt like meek was even a mentor to me just watching this . Hopefully there are a lot of people like him out there on the streets. I never realized Baltimore had an accent until this movie either . I really wanted mouse to listen the whole time so badly ",1
2420,"Wow this movie was bad. Interesting concept but lacks a lot. Never explains the ""why"" behind the system and don't see a conclusive ending. A waste of 90 mins of my time. Also very graphic that I wasn't expecting. The visual effects were actually good and the acting was ok.",0
2421,"fantastic, breath of fresh air. Obvious enough to show class-ism without being too in-your-face. IT's amazing to watch.

You will want to watch it more than once to capture everything included in such a great film.",1
2422,"The quality of the movie is very dependent on how well the concept is executed, thankfully I think The Platform explores this screwed up thought experiment about as thoroughly as possible. The movie also benefits from having very few inhibitions – it's one of those stories that explore the worst of humanity, and it just works better when it isn't limited in what it can show. I also really like a few performances in here and the movie even has an effective dark sense of humor at times. The movie is very dark so stay away if that's not your cup of tea but it's also  gripping and worth watching if you like to explore what happens to humans in inhuman conditions.",1
2423,"An utter trainwreck of nonsense that thinks it's original, compelling, and poignant. It's none of those things. It's absurd with gaping plot holes and contradictions that ruin anything redeeming you may try to dig out of. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",0
2424,"I was waiting for the movie to get good, but then it ended. Overall a movie that I would not want to watch again, just because it was boring and terrible. I don't recommend this movie.",0
2425,"Highly emotional, well constructed",1
2426,"Der Schacht ist ein Science-Fiction-Thriller von Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia. In dieses dystopische Märchen verbergen sich Botschaften. Eine verrückte, selbstsüchtigen und verbraucherorientierten Lebensstil, und das Fehlen einer gerechten Verteilung von oben nach unten. Der Film ist ein hervorragender Psychothriller über die unentwickelten Klassenverhältnisse des Kapitalismus. Der Film bietet alles: Feine Küche, Gefangenschaft, Hunger, Machtkämpfe, Klassenkämpfe, Wahn, Kannibalismus ...Das Drehbuch ist ausgezeichnet, die Inszenierung ist gelungen, der Soundtrack ist fantastisch, die schauspielerischen Darstellungen sind charismatisch, und die visuellen Effekte erwähnungswert.",1
2427,"The movie was a lot of fun, and there were a number of scenes that served as a backdrop for the current state of the world. The film depicted a class society of people, representing a society in which those with wealth had goods. Leftovers above go below. There were many very shocking scenes, but I could also tell that this is the real world. However, the ending was not consistent and some aspects were difficult to convey to the audience. It is also not recommended to watch it at night because of the many violent and grotesque scenes.",1
2428,PUTA BASTARDA is the only thing i learned.,0
2429,Definitely a movie trying to make a statement & a movie that will make you think.,0
2430,Very good premise but just too over-the-top with violence for violence sake.,0

2433, I don’t get the love for it. The movie was forgettable.,0
2434,"When it comes to immortality, what can happen is at least intriguing. And with Charlize Theron there is guaranteed action. Nothing epic, but not boring either. Pop on a Corona beer and hang out.",0
2435,"I mean, to be honest, it was better than I anticipated, because I anticipated complete trash. Instead, we were just met with mediocrity. I feel like my expectations for Netflix Originals has dropped a lot.",0
2436,"It's sad to see such a great premise ruined from mostly lackluster directing, CW quality scriptwriting and a desire to be ""woke"" above all else.",0
2437,Impossible to connect with any of these characters.  No development and pretty much current Hollywood stereotypes.,0
2438,It felt bland and pretentious. Sort of like watching a bunch of people try really hard to be entertaining.,0

Cue succubus, gags that work, more that don't and rather a lot of B movie gore. Quite a nice idea, but doesn't fully work.",0
2443,"This movie is quite boring but makes you wait for something. Like, you're almost sure that there will be something great, you just have to wait for another 5... well... 10... hm... 30 minutes... or an hour... and a half... What? It's already over and nothing happened?? Eh... okay.",0
2444,I friggin' love this movie. So funny and fun. And feminist.,1
2445,"Okay, this had some viscerally disgusting moments (a plus in my book), and it was AWESOME.  lol  I really enjoyed this and laughed a lot!",1
2446,Fun comedic horror film about the hidden past of a suburban neighborhood theatre with a past that comes back to literally haunt you.,1
2447,Eh it probably could get a tiny bit lower of a score idk 2.3,0
2448,"The story is ridiculous enough to work as a pretty good horror comedy, held up by likeable characters, some good acting, and plenty of humour. Toss in what had to be the most disturbing scene I have personally seen in a film, and 'Porno' was unlike anything I've seen all year.",1
2449,"A really fun throwback where repressed, religious and straight edge teens screen a vintage porno film and unleash a succubus to wreak havoc on their testicles. It's funny, gory and even has a poignant message about learning to accept and love yourself. I loved that it took place in the 90s too. We need more period pieces in this decade.",1
2450,"Movie tackles messing with time cleverly. Fun cinematic techniques, both for the visuals and the horrorific effects. I think the movie lands the ending and makes it more worthwhile for well executed story. Glad to see Anthony Mackie in a leading role. Folks might find this slightly reminiscent of his Black Mirror episode in light of the scifi elements.",1
2451,Good movie. Need to pay attention if not you will miss out....,1
2452,"The story moves quickly, keeping you engaged.  Anthony Mackie was good in his complex role.",1

2456,"Really great movie, super trippy.",1
2457,If this were streaming I would have left in the first 30 minutes.  It ended up holding my attention but was too hectic and disjointed at the beginning,1

2461,Maybe I'm just old but it made me laugh. Uplifting to me.,1
2462,It works well as an homage to 80's TV. But as a movie: kind of skinny and useless.,0
2463,"Watching this movie is the closest thing I've had to a religious experience.
 
Without question, from start to finish, ""VHYES"" is the most hysterical movie I've seen in the last few years – if not entire decade. The filmmakers establish in the opening minutes the sort of crowd they intend to play to during the rest of the movie's fragmented vomit collage of garishly-hued neon cocaine chaos of 80's film & TV media-themed content.  
 
The obvious jokes you'd assume to be in something like are there, sure. But even the most cynical detractors of this sort of material will have a hard time justifying such prejudicial attitudes when the credits are rolling. I was a bit worried that the laughing hysteria I was experiencing not even 15 minutes into the movie that it couldn't possibly carry on for another hour without some noticeable gaps where maybe the jokes get old, or that the initial appeal of seeing such a surprising number of cameos from various LEGENDS of comedic acting would wear off – but my fears were not only unfounded, they ended up being so off that I struggle to understand why I had any reservations in the first place. 

Whether or not you walk away with the same enthusiasm I did is not what is important, (as you'll hopefully see for yourself.) I challenge you to watch this and not be at least a little bit impressed with the amount of creative moxie that burst through 4:3 aspect ratio seams of a cocaine-fueled neon mirror of reality that was the 1980's of American pop culture. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll DEFINITELY be weirded out – but fear not! – for it doesn't take long for the lesbian aliens to fix your machines(!) and you'll be slow-dancing away the evening to a power-ballad so authentic in its form that you never notice the fact that the joke goes on for several stretched minutes, just daring the audience to turn it off or walk away...because they know you won't, they know the hooks are in, deep. Enjoy. I did.",1
2464,"I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe something a little Tim and Eric esque? It didn't disappoint in that department. Lots of surreal humor and lo-fi public access TV nostalgia, but it held its own. It was oddly  sincere, silly, sad, and a little spooky. Really enjoyed this movie.",1
2465,This is certainly a different type of movie with no particular story or direction rather just a collage of late 80s styled skits mixed all into one . Not all the skits hit the mark or were perfect but a few of them had me laughing . It was definitely something different and anyone who is a fan of dumb humor will enjoy this . I am a little surprised the critics rated this as high as they did . I would have guessed this would be a high audience score and low critic one 3.4. Silly for 95% of the movie and a little horror thrown in at the end ,1
2466,"I don't rate films very much. I think I may have a review on 222film and purposely gave the prequel to ""My Darn Cat"" three purrs. 

Anyway I don't even want to try to describe the film. I feel like you just need to watch it. If I had to do one of those crappy blah meets blah meets blah reviews, I'd be forced to go with SCTV meets Tim and Eric meets Found Footage Fest meets. Damn, I think that's all of it. 
It's a crazy film. It features Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins (in cameos) and well as both produced the film. It also features Weyes Blood, Thomas Lennon (Reno 911) Kerri Kenny (The State), and Charlene Yi (Knocked Up). If you like VHS culture you will love or hate it. Once you hate it you'll have to get your vintage VCR that's records way too much bottom squiggles, record it, and then throw it out the god damn window.",1
2467,"Weird, funny and with an unexpected twist at the end.",1
2468,"Its the type of low-budget filmmaking, young director should start with to build experience and show promise, which Robbins does here with a mixed bag vision thats equally impressive nostalgic VHS throwback found-footage, filled with absurdity that never goes for the big laughs. It left me kinda confused what the whole reason for the film was, even its serious moments.",0
2469,most original deliverance. naughty and delicious,1
2470,"If you want to see a group of old war veteran friends fight violently and fiercely against a bunch of punk drug dealers, with lots of action, blood and a strong dose of stubbornness, this sure is the one.",1
2471,"More an action packed movie. But it does not disappoint. Quite entertaining from the begginng to the end, showcasing a retro 80s vibe full of nostalgia.  This one is ideal for us to watch with our daddy.",1
2472,Fan-freakin-tactic gory B movie horror thriller and nothing else like it!,1
2473,An overacted and poorly directed rip-off of a wannabe John Carpenter style film. I think they even stole the theme music from Escape from New York. Like the majority of Shudder film produced projects this is just one more missed opportunity. I'm surprised they didn't have Adrienne Barbeau  do a walk-on.,0
2474,Fair. Squirting blood. ,0
2475,"With a cast of familiar faces ""VFW"" is a fun violent mix of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) the neon lights of the 80s & the nostalgia of Grindhouse titles.",1
2476,Visually stunning; sadly that is the only good thing about this movie.,0
2477,"Take a bunch of badass elder action heroes (well, more like a very cool second tier version of ""The Expendables""), which includes Stephen Lang (""Tombstone"" ""Manhunter""), William Sadler (""Die Hard 2"" ""Trespass""), Fred Williamson (""Black Caesar"" ""Hell Up In Harlem"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn""), Martin Kove (""The Karate Kid"" ""Rambo: First Blood Part II""), and you have a low budget action film I defy Gen-X action film fans to resist. In addition to the aforementioned actors, you also get David Patrick Kelly (""The Warriors"" ""Dreamscape"" ""The Crow"") and George Wendt (""Cheers"" ""House"" ""Dreamscape""), so the VFW heroes are a group it's hard not to root for. The story has these elder badasses hanging out at their local VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) lodge when they find themselves protecting a witness to murder from savage street gang, leading to a wildly brutal siege by the mutant gang members. The story is basically ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (which itself was a spiritual remake of ""Rio Bravo""), but what the story lacks in originality is made up for by stylish and suspenseful direction by Joe Begos (lots of neon and low lights to hide wrinkles on vain aging actors, I'm guessing), a surprisingly strong subtext about aging and the treatment of our elder community, and terrifically fun gory retro special effects done practically and without CGI. In terms of film violence, ""VFW"" blows away contemporary siege films such as ""The Purge"" or ""Dog Soldiers"" in terms of gore and viscera, but while the film is utterly savage, it's done in a manner where the audience will laugh as much as cringing. Overall, ""VFW"" is pretty unoriginal, but also pretty hard to resist for fans of violent old school action flicks. FUN FACT! ""VFW"" was co-written by Max Brallier, who is best know as the author of the popular kids book series ""The Last Kids on Earth"" as well as some hilariously adult themed post apocalyptic choose-your-own-adventure books.",1
2478,"What a fucking cast! Stephen Lang is great as the leader, crazy  William Sadler, Big Fred Williamson, Martin (Karate Kid) Kove, David Patrick Kelly (wasted) and George Wendt dead too early! The performances hold it together and more with some solid  direction. Outstanding start - really good street drugs causing zombies! Collapse of society.

2492,"Spoilers ahead: I was struck by the film's great animation. The writers did a good job of making the audience emotionally attached to the mother. The film does a good job of addressing complex ideas of how to grow around grief. The wall of darkness that enveloped Fei Fei and Chang'e in the end was penetrated by love and new experiences. The loss, the grief, doesn't ever completely go away, but one can learn to love new things and incorporate the memories of that which was lost. 

I was surprised seeing the audience review scores.  I've read a few comparisons to Disney/Pixar. Perhaps some were expecting the movie to fit a Disney/Pixar mold, and were disappointed when the film did not meet those expectations. I enjoyed the songs throughout the movie. The melodies were simple and the songs were written to follow the movie's themes, not necessarily for commercial success. Each character was thoughtfully designed, none suffering from same-face syndrome. Also, the food in the movie is like the 3D equivalent to Studio Ghibli food. You'll really want to eat it.

Como é animação é sempre maravilhoso seja criança ou adulto ver cores e mais cores, isso faz os olhos abrirem, isso sem contar tendo um roteiro bem estruturado, tudo faz diferença nesse filme que mais uma vez acerta sem adicionar aquele tal 'felizes para sempre.'

Claro que tudo não ia ser óbvio, no filme que também é musical a garotinha tira até foto com a deusa e pensou que ia terminar por aí? Não, a figura mística queria um presente, e Fei Fei teria que adivinhar o que realmente ela queria o que não seria nada fácil, assim ela e o seu irmão postiço tentam encontrar a fotografia para logo zarpar de lá, mas tem uma reflexão interessante a Chang'E queria de volta o seu amor e assim como a Fei Fei que queria sua mãe de volta, tanto que não aceitou seu pai namorar outra mulher, e em retrospecto a menina para em um lugar um tanto como triste e misterioso no qual a deusa estava lá mas sem os apetrechos e a maquiagem, ela estava lá sozinha, desolada, como se fosse a demonstração da depressão em desenho, bem triste.

Depois de tudo a Fei Fei consigo sair de lá e finalmente caiu na real, que como a Chang'E que tentou trazer de volta seu amado algo impossível cientificamente, isso não foi nada mais que um ensinamento, que devemos seguir em frente mesmo que seja muito dura a caminhada, e esse foi o verdadeiro final feliz da vida real sem príncipe encantado.",1

Sure there are some shocking moments, fast paced scenes and the like but it doesn't really mean a lot and there's just not much to get too absorbed by or anything. If you don't like the sound of crying babies then this film isn't for you, as quite a lot of it consists of the mum trying to convince herself things are ok and keeping her very young baby settled as she goes from place to place.

Unusual films are important for genre's like this gangster film told from the point of view of a meek trophy wife.  I appreciated that Jean didn't evolve into a badass that went on a revenge spree with all her violent actions being easily defendable.  The plot was compelling and held my attention throughout the film, despite using tropes that I've seen many times before.  The divisive Tomato rating difference between critic and audience is most likely due to the film's slow pace, which was similar to Arkansas (2020) as both films have an abundance of dialogue and exposition with peaks being few in between.  It's a unique story that I believe is a worthwhile watch and I recommend it as a PLAY.

Exquisitely filmed in black and white with a fine cast, smart writing and an atmospheric score, this latest offering from director Martha Stephens recalls such releases as ""The Last Picture Show"" and ""Desert Hearts"" but with a narrative and sensibilities all its own.

However. Actually WATCHING this movie was difficult and almost painful. Long, rambling conversations and too many unnecessary artsy shots made the film feel excruciatingly long and boring, while at the same time it was probably the most pretentious movie I've ever seen. The best example of both of these would be the 10-minute interpretive dance towards the end...

So to sum it up, I really don't know how to feel about this movie at all! Maybe the book is better?",0

I can appreciate the time travel metaphor, but that it wasn't so self-indulgent over pain and loss.  What may have been therapeutic for Kaufman in the making of the film, is laboriously taxing and burdening for the viewer.  Is wasting the ice cream snack worse than my problems?  The movie could have been comedic and manageable, as the protagonist seems never to have emotionally graduated from high school, if it were more like Napoleon Dynamite.  But as we have it here, any possibility of sympathy, is turned to wrought over this narcissistic and foreboding character role.",0

However, the flow of the story was in-cohesive and while it left me with lingering questions, it was more frustrating with the pretentious energy draining banter. I felt void of all energy by the end of movie. It leaves much to the imagination to ponder, yet a quote in the book of Tao can do the same, in only a sentence or two.",0

Type ""intellectual bestseller"" for gays))) A lot of smart words and thoughts and ideas and feelings...but it all gets stuck in the hopeless boredom of the script..or human madness. The protagonist is hysterical, aggressive, impulsive... there is nothing good or bright in him. Why should I watch all this?",0
2535,"Put the phone down.  So this is about a group of seven gay friends in 1960s New York City.  It is the birthday of Harold (Zachary Quinto), so Michael (Jim Parsons) throws a small party at his apartment.  When you add a couple of surprise guests and a lot of alcohol to the mix, it is a recipe for drama.  I feel like I have one of these movies every year.  With the number of movies that come out any given year, I'm bound to miss a couple of ones I'm interested in, and I don't like going into a new year without completing my watchlist from the previous year.  It was Portrait of a Lady on Fire in 2019, and The Boys in the Band is that movie for me in 2020.  It's a shame I missed this Netflix remake last year because it would have made my best of the year cut.  Now, this is based on a stage play that I have absolutely no familiarity with, and it was already adapted into a film fifty years ago.  They decided to keep it set in the 60s, and I think that was the right call to make.  Even behind closed doors, I don't think this script would work as fluently without an update to language in modern times, but keeping the decade the same helps to keep it feeling natural.  I enjoyed the period piece touches of this, which includes a snappy soundtrack that doesn't get flashy or in your face, but still delivers some great music at the same time.  Once these guys get together, that is when this picks up, and that only takes about fifteen minutes to get there.  It's very stagy in the best way possible, and for me, this found success the same way that One Night in Miami did.  It's essentially a bottle story as 95% of the events take place in this apartment, and I would love to see a live production of this.  It's an ensemble effort, and I didn't feel like there was a weak link, but at the same time, I did always feel like this was Jim Parsons' movie.  I think he gets a bad rep as an actor from people who hate on The Big Bang Theory, but I have always thought he has serious acting chops.  The culture was so much more closeted back then, and this story remains relevant when you compare it to now.  We have made a lot of progress, but there is still more work to be done.  I think everybody here shares tremendous chemistry, and that is the secret ingredient that keeps this so engaging.  I always believed that these guys are friends, and I bought into the history of their pasts with one another without having to see it.  They rib each other as friends do, but lines eventually get crossed, which is always a possibility when you add too much liquor to the equation.  I was thoroughly engaged by The Boys in the Band from start to finish, and I would happily watch this again.",1

2541,"This is a very quirky film, which struck me as a bit like a play only obviously a film version of it I suppose. It seemed somehow quite touching, being primarily about a father trying to re-connect with his son, spending time with him and sharing family tales - imparting his wisdom.

In some scenes there's not much dialogue, thus it can be pretty quiet, which may bore some people but it does create a certain atmosphere. I like the fact most of the settings feature quite stylishly coloured surroundings (think bright colours and funky wallpaper). I thought symmetry played quite an important part in the cinematography somehow. Speaking of cinematography, I liked the cats eyes type shots - panoramas of sometimes desolate landscapes.

It has quite a British feel to it too, unsurprisingly. If your a fan of the wordplay game Scrabble, then I reckon you would enjoy this film. Also, if your wondering about the title of the film, it is specifically explained (i.e. what it means) during the film.

Bill Nighy, Sam Riley and Alice Lowe both give very decent performances, in my opinion (also present are Jenny Agutter and Tim McInnerny). There are some amusing lines of dialogue, though I'd say its more of a quirky drama than an 'out and out' comedy film as such. The music featured is also quite poignant and helped add to the atmosphere, I felt.

Yes, I'd definitely recommend this film - I thought it was both quite nicely understated and surprisingly touching.",1
2542,"Sometimes Always Never (2019), directed by Carl Hunter and written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, is a quirky dramatic mystery with touches of comedy.  It stars Bill Nighy (Alan), Sam Riley (Peter), Alice Lowe (Sue, Peter's wife), Jenny Agutter (Margaret), Tom McInnerny (Arthur), and Louis Healy (Jack, Peter's son).

Nighy plays Alan, an articulate, dapperly dressed widower, a tailor by profession, who moves in temporarily with his adult son Peter and his family.  Years ago, Alan's eldest son Michael walks out on the family over a game of Scrabble and is never heard of since.    Alan embarks on a decades long search to find him which proves fruitless.  The film opens with him handing out flyers of his missing son Michael.   When a body turns up, Alan and his adult son Peter must identify the remains.  Alan's tenuous relationship with his second son is put to the test.  Is the body belonging to his son Michael? Can Alan and his family have closure?  Is Michael still alive which Alan suspects when he encounters an online Scrabble player who uses the word ""Zo"" like his son did so many years ago?  The film is full of twists and turns which fuels the dramatic tension of the film.   

Nighy's physical characteristics and social attributes - his lankiness, deep voice, calm demeanor, intelligence, and social graces renders a sympathetic nuanced portrait of an elderly man mourning the lost of a son.  It's a well acted film and all the characters have their moments to shine and show their mettle.  The theme of the sudden death of a relationship figures prominently in the narrative and makes the film relatable to a wide audience.  Who hasn't suffered the loss of someone significant or meaningful in their lives?  The narrative of the long lost son is juxtaposed against the narrative of Alan's undying search for his lost son Michael and his relationship with his second son Peter which is simmering with tensions which fuels the dramatic tension in the film.  

It's an appealing film beautifully shot and acted with an intriguing story line.  The motif of language and connecting runs through the film providing the film with a cohesive structure.  The game Scrabble features prominently in the film which not only serves as a  means of fostering and not fostering communication and connection but is the clue to solving the mystery of Michael.  Alan is a master at the game and in one of the most quirkiest scenes in the film is when he hustles a couple in game with a view to shaking down Arthur, Margaret's husband, out of two hundred British pounds.  One of the most powerful scenes in the film is the scene involving Alan and the coroner behind an opaque glassed paneled door which they have entered to identify the remains, only the shadows of their silhouettes are visible.  

It's an intriguing film because it is in essence a re-working of the biblical Jesus parable of The Prodigal Son which appears in Luke 15:11–32 which crops up in the text of the film.  But it's more than a dramatic mystery but a 'coming of together' film where a family marred by tragedy comes together to heal and bond, and get on with the job of living.   But, it's also a film about love and redemption.  I enjoyed seeing the growing affection between grand-father and grand-son take root, and how Alan and Peter are eventually reconciled.

If you are a fan of the stellar cast like me, you'll enjoy the film for its dramatic acting performances.  If you are a fan of foreign films, you'll like it for its style of cinematic filmmaking and story telling.   If you are a fan of dramatic mysteries, you'll like the film for its genre.  There's much to recommend it.  Do see it for you won't be disappointed.",1
2543,Kind of typical for a British film.  A bit broody with lingering silent scenes.  A dry sense of humor.  Entertaining enough in its own way.  Bill Nighy does his usual good job.,0

2546,"Impressive visually and comedically successful at points. Can't help but feel as if the performances were subdued and the characters not as charming as they clearly hoped to make them. The visuals are honestly the most notable thing, when I think in most films they should be supplementary. I don't think that style is a substitute for substance in this case, despite there being enough substance for a somewhat satisfying experience. At its core it is too earnest to take serious issue with, so one cannot be too harsh. Nighy does alright as a quiet yet eccentric father, but some aspects of his performance felt very average, although this could have been the writing.",0
2547,"A very quirky, dry comedy with some slightly dark themes.  The film stars Bill Nighy as a family man, a sometime tailor, and always a Scrabble enthusiast.  Scrabble hustler or Scrabble addict' may be more appropriate terms.  The dry comedy style is intended to catch the audience off guard.  While this movie may not appear promising to most, it may pleasantly surprise many.",1
2548,"It was just too knowingly light-touch to be convincing. Contrived whimsy like this is just plain annoying - typical of which was the driving scenes, which were knowingly dated, and unreal in their use of background film with actors sat in the studio-based, stationary car. It looked like what it was - an attempt to make a quirky virtue out of a lack of budget. It was just too convenient, and it made me feel sorry for the producers.
The whole thing, which could have been rescued by an engaging plot, was no more than a picaresque odyssey, lacking heft, and the sad thing about saying that, is that in the right hands, you feel that something could have been done with this.",0
2549,"Words can be powerful.  So this is about a father (Bill Nighy) who has lost his son years back.  There wasn't a horrible accident or anything; the boy just walked out on his family and never returned after an argument over Scrabble.  This story is about the father trying to track down his son with no leads while reconnecting with the family that he does have.  Now I am a big fan of Bill Nighy, so I was looking forward to this.  He has never made a project worse by having his name added to the cast list, but it is almost always supporting, not front and center.  He seldom gets cast in roles where he is the lead, and let me tell you: I am pleased to get that here.  I don't think that this movie is perfect, but it does have its strengths.  For starters, I highly enjoyed the premise.  It may be my particular tastes, but it makes me laugh to no end: somebody getting heated over a board game to the point where they walk out of the room and just never come back.  I also appreciated Nighy in this.  Sure, he isn't playing this overly different from the roles you've seen him in previously, but he is still a lovable rascal, and that is infectious.  He causes friction by just being himself with his particular personality, and because there is conflict, you want to see how this is going to play out.  I also loved how he wasn't afraid to confront his son who isn't missing, played here by Sam Riley; it is so rare to see somebody get called out for being passive-aggressive, it was refreshing to watch it here.  Sometimes, Always, Never is an enjoyable little film, and that is my biggest critique: it is small in scope.  It is a somewhat quirky indie movie, and if you enjoy Wes Anderson, you will probably like this, albeit to a lesser extent.  The story is personable, but I don't know how long I will retain from this one after the fact.  It has charm and would likely be a great movie to watch with your parents.  I know it might be confusing for this to have a wide release in the same calendar year as Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always, but I still give them both recommendations.",1
2550,"I couldn't get into this one. Comparing this to other films about kids experiencing the horrors of war, it can't help but pale to ""Come and See"", but every war film I've seen does, so I won't hold that against this film. What I will hold against it though is how cold I was left throughout it. In spite of how much misery the boy experiences and witnesses in the film (physical abuse, rape, suicide, animal cruelty, pedophilia, bestiality, antisemitism, etc.), the impact it had on him remained too vague for those scenes to stick with me in any lasting way. A lot of this falls on Kotlár since neither his acting nor his physical appearance make any changes throughout the film. Rather, he just keeps the same blank expression on his face and looks the same at the end of the film as he does in the opening. Even the retaliation angle in the second half of the film, while it's one of the more promising elements of the film, didn't click with me as well as it could've due to the reasons listed above. Technically speaking though, the movie is pretty good. Some of the larger-scale gunfights looked cool and, in spite of what I said up above, a couple of the disturbing scenes left a decent impact on me (that's to be expected with a movie like this though). Also, while fair criticisms could be made that the black and white photography looks too pretty and doesn't pair well the disturbing content shown in the film, I enjoyed how it created a contrast between the two. Finally, it was also cool to see Aleksei Kravchenko (star of the aforementioned ""Come and See"") in this film, perhaps as a nod to the film. Overall though, the film sort of just came and went and was pretty forgettable.",0
2551,"A powerful must see Holocaust film. The child lead is absolutely outstanding. Though his character is just an innocent child caught up in genocide, he has the unstoppable will, wit and grit of the most heroic of adult soldiers.",1
2552,"I read ""The Painted Bird"" 50 years ago and found the reading difficult but ehard to put down. The memories of the book haunted me for years. I later read reviews by critics who accused Kosinski of plagiarizing or inventing his material. Perhaps I had been duped into reading something I should not. 

One of the lines of critique engages in the notion that the book--and the movie--are depictions of Nazi Germany. Indeed, the critics say, the scenes did not take place in Germany. The Germans played a small role. It's therefore not a good movie about the Holocaust. 

But that's wrong. The greatest excesses of the Holocaust did in fact occur outside of Germany in Eastern Europe. Even German Jews, and for that matter Dutch and French Jews, were deported into Eastern Europe to be murdered. 

The story line of the Painted Bird is almost certainly apocryphal, a work of fiction, not a documentary.  Like all fiction, it draws its material from human nature. The various depictions of ugliness provided in the book--and in the movie--might never have been witnessed by any one person, and a few might not have actually ever occurred, and only been invented in the  imaginations of twisted people. But the fact remains the stories are there, the notions of depravity are there.  And the fact remains that in Eastern Europe in the 1940s a massive amount of unspeakable, depraved cruelty happened. 

The movie almost perfectly captures Kozinski's story. One can argue whether the story itself should have been told, for the reasons I mentioned above. I believe that it is an important story, not as a document of historical detail, but as a document of human ignorance and cruelty. If we fail to understand that ignorance and cruelty were at the core of the depravity that enveloped Eastern Europe, we have missed not only what happened, but are inviting it to happen again.",1

It's a herculean task to get grasp of everything Marhoul is attempting to do and that overambitious effort leads to a miss.  Is it art?  Is it exploitative? Maybe some of column A and some of column B.  Final Score: 5.0/10",0
2555,"From the opening scene to the very end, I cried. This is not an easy film to watch, I had to cover my eyes at times as a seemly endless parade of human cruelty, inhumanity and depravity marched by; but at the same time, it was touching and beautiful. Beautifully written, acted, filmed and directed. It’s a courageous movie and a testament to the endurance of the human spirit amid almost unimaginable suffering. It leaves you pondering the human condition and the blindness of hatred and prejudice—literally.",1
2556,"Normally I'm all for these types of movies, the really explicit films trying to make a point with artistic merit, challenging their audiencing, and I enjoy and defend these films... but yhis one doesn't have many redeeming values. The critics lie when they say it has emotional impact, it's more of a numbing sensation from being on the other end of a punch-drunk wrestler who just got his life ruined right before his eyes. The movie opens with a sequence of shocking animal cruelty -- points to the film for shock value, creativity, originality, and uses of quietness and minimalism by the way -- and from there it's just 3 hours of scene-after-scene unpleasantness. It's not entertaining, it KIND OF gets a reaction out of you, but it doesn't leave you emotionally compelled just turned off because there's no significance to what you're seeing for either character development, plot, or atmosphere. It's just unpleasant, miserable cruelty for the sake of exploitation and I think it's trying to have a message but it lost what it was in the process, because nothing seems to really correlate other than ""let's abuse the little boy on-screen as brutally as possible as many times as possible"" and I'm not sure what the point of it all was. There wasn't really a plot, just being passed to different acclaimed actors (Harvey Keitel, Udo Kier, and Stellan Skarsgard) who made me interested in the movie in the first place along with the acclaim. It was more horrific than any horror movie I'd seen despite being labeled a drama. The uncompromisingly bleak visuals do have a sad, memorable beauty to them when something inexcusable isn't happening. There's NC-17 movies I found less unpleasant than this one. Just not a good time in the slightest. It sounds terrible without context, but other war dramas, WWII movies like Schindler's List are at least enjoyable. They're a bit sad, but it's necessary. What scene in this movie feels necessary to the whole? There's no cohesion! Maybe it's my fault for watching an Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsgard movie, like I should've expected Lars Von Trier, but I just wasn't prepared for arthouse horror tonight. I usually love those movies, but those I knew what I was getting into and I never got bored.",0

2558,"The Painted Bird, based on the bleak-as-all-hell-not-at-all-biographical novel of the same name, is close to 3 hours of a young boy wandering around a continent torn apart by war and, it would seem, 18th century superstition. I picked up the book in 2014 and it was a very compelling read. The horrors it describes are savage and unrelenting, and it doesn't have many moments of levity. It also isn't very long. The movie adaptation is almost 170 minutes, and while it fits in plenty of violence, there's also an absurd amount of downtime. The book was well-paced and always had something going on, but the film often drags its heels, with characters standing around staring at nothing in particular or walking slowly around. It's like the film keeps getting interrupted by an annoying arthouse flick, and you find yourself actually anticipating the violence just to alleviate the tedium, something you didn't get with the book. It's got some fairly big name, but most of the actors you'll recognise have little more than cameos, with the great Stellan Skarsgård not even getting a single word of dialogue. It's a weird combination of Eli Roth torture porn and Terrence Malick arthouse pretentions. Its bloated length is compounded by its languid pacing, and had about an hour been cut out, which is very doable, it would have been an easier watch. I admire the talent and effort which went into it, and when it wants you to sit up and take notice, you always do. Not for the faint of heart, or those with less than 3 hours to kill, but it's a noble effort nonetheless.",0

2572,"Critics seem to love this. The trailer made it look like an intriguing comedy-thriller. It is not. Don’t be swayed by all the raves about Romanian New Wave and deliberately deadpan delivery, pulp fiction etc. It has an interesting premise, but there is zero connection between the viewer and any of the characters, not any credible connection between the characters themselves. One character goes to an island to learn a whole new whistling language, only to use it for about two sentences in the whole film? And after a certain number of double-crossings, it begins to not matter who’s side anyone is on. ",0
2573,"Nah. Not in the least. I don’t understand how any of these plot points connect, who the characters are, what they want, what the timeline is. None of this film makes sense. Nothing is at stake.

2575,"Really enjoyed the character development and the story's format. It rolls on at a steady pace, building the anticipation slowly. Just as it starts to reveal itself, it's as if the director goes for a prolonged break! From thereon, it seems to resort to a lacklustre and sleepy methodology, which is a real shame. With a little more effort, and a tad more tempo, this could have been something really special",1
2576,Now This movie is not for everybody especially me. Maybe if it was in English I would connect with it more but in its current state it's just mediocre. The concept is pretty intriguing but overall it makes for a long bore of a movie night. Now I know that this is a arty Oscar type movie but still. This Oscar movies should connect with us but they don't. It's kind of a shame.,0
2577,"The Whistlers is twisty noir in which everyone is playing multiple angles. There are a couple fun surprises that come out of that, but really I think this movie feels more like the director just thinks the whistling language is really cool and wanted to build a film around it. We get lots of detail about proper finger and tongue placement. We learn that Romanian whistling and Spanish whistling have different consonants and vowels. And as someone who can't whistle I think it's pretty neat that the actors learn the language.",0

Além de discutir assuntos que funcionaram muito bem quando trabalhados no contexto do filme, como vícios e desvios psicológicos (eu diria até freudianos). O timing de humor é simplesmente perfeito, me peguei rindo em vários momentos do filme, que de tão peculiares e despretensiosos, despertam o cômico. Em certos momentos até identifiquei um humor mais ""The Office"", com cenas desconfortáveis e constrangedoras, e que o filme faz questão de prolongar. A atmosfera de tensão e suspense também foi construída de forma exemplar, e o Plot Twist foi a cereja do bolo dessa grata surpresa. A direção do Evan Morgan é muito competente e de um bom nível técnico, e o Adam Brody desempenha bem seu papel (considero-o um bom ator, muitas vezes subestimado).",1
2591,"I have never been to Canada so this is just speculation or riding the cliché joke about Canadians. ""The Kid Detective"" might just be the most Canadian movie of all time. In a good way.

The dry humor and low key, deadpan way all the characters seem to have is so great. The plot and the mystery are not too bad either. Unusual. I don't know if it's meant to be kid friendly or that the avoidance of curse words and sexual situations is part of the joke. I'm thinking it's part of the joke because some grizzly stuff is referred to. The way my stage persona Sugar never cussed, except when he did, to great effect. Or was the sweet old southernish man that started slow then described extreme sex in terms of an electromagnetic pulse. Actually I told that joke two ways. 
Anyway I may like this movie for the best reason of all, the humor reminds me of me. lol",1

It's a clever blend of charming dark comedy and a whodunit with a serious centre that it expertly dances around before hitting you with the full blast in the finale. The conflicting tones do somewhat diminish each other from having a deeper impact, but it's also what makes ‘The Kid Detective' interesting, enjoyable and entertaining to watch.",1

He'a a very likable guy who is looking for redemption, but there's no way average Americans wouldn't want to talk to Arquette.  There's a scene that goes a little over trying to portray him as a complete loser.  It's overkill.  The second half of the film is heartwarming.   There are wrestling fans who won't watch this because the common theory is 'David Arquette killed the business' (of wrestling).  It's really uplifting even if it's filmed more like an action film.  Arquette served as an executive producer so understand going in this is a vehicle for the protagonist.  Stay through the credits, that's real!  Final Score: 7/10",1

2634,"Golden age of Hollywood biopic by Fincher, nicely shot and entertaining. Feel must revisit Welles' works...",0
2635,"A little review of tomorrow's Oscar nominee 2021, movie about Orson Welles' 1941 movie ""Citizen Kane"", that will undoubtedly win some awards, because Hollywood traditionally likes to award second-rate films about some other good films, which is in due time failed to reward, with excellent Gary Oldman as Herman Mankiewicz, screenwriter of ""Citizen Kane"".

In short, to make a film, how different than of course black & white, because it talks about the period in which only such existed (luckily at that time at least they were tonal, because otherwise, according to such logic, we would probably get a silent one?), with copying each a shot that Welles ever shot (but with occasional insertions of totally inappropriate ones, with a counter-light, because it's so modern nowadays), about a character who was really fantastically played by Oldman, who only gets all the praise for this average achievement. Unfortunately, the character he interprets in some Golden Age movies could at best be only supporting one, if at all interesting enough to be immortalized on the movie screen. But, oh-my-god, those are the times.

The lead actor is the only reason why this film is worth watching. In this it bears a resemblance to its competitor ""The Father,"" with Anthony Hopkins, also in the lead role. From an interesting idea, but extremely unsuccessfully realized, we can only admire, or not, the proven actors.

Honestly, I regret that such an achievement comes from David Fincher, director of such movies as e.g. was (with all its flaws) the cult ""Fight Club,"" but apparently the prevailing idea was that the line of least resistance was the shortest shortcut for Hollywood. We'll see soon enough.",0
2636,Probably to intellectual for most common movie goers who weren’t film majors students or even political historians but this movie 🎥 is brilliant. Giving credit to one of the most important stories about one of the most influential movies ever. It’s almost a cautionary tale of one man’s fall from grace and another man’s rise of character before his ascent into thematic obscurity and infamy all in a time that Hollywood forgot. A very similar themed ‘bite the hand that feeds you’ movie and downfall would be that of Truman Capote and his expose of the high society of his time and subsequent banishment and fall from the kingdom he was part of. ,1
2637,"As influences go originated from the reminisced past, there's a lot of respect from David Fincher when he directed another solid picture but frankly lessened masterfully due to towering recognition from his surprisingly closely-connected replication towards the developing film of subject's cinematic patterns. When that replication came to play, it pleasantly functions classically by the old-style apparatus across the production merits, particularly the type of cinematograph usage in perfectly presenting the depicted period along with the talented level perfectly embodying what was being asked when portraying known figures in that era, dimensionally fulfilling the story's periodical capture. The attention towards Fincher's detailed direction and the cast's fine performances may have become secondary due to the association with ""Citizen Kane"" on how it visually and humanely follows whilst develops towards eventual acclaim of considerably recognized greatness as a cinematic stepping stone,  thus inadvertently preventing to mainly focus on the story as its own, but undeniably still delivers as expected filled with recognized skills honoring the initially piqued worth, as well a new addition in the catalogue of contemporarily-evolved films gorgeously mimicking 20th century cinema.

2641,"""Mank"" is a film that seems as if it was never intended to be seen by most of the public. And, while most film critics and the Oscars loved the movie, the average person would have doubtless left the theater (or Netflix) completely confused. After all, to really appreciate the film and follow it, you need to know who folks like Irving Thalberg, William Randolph Hearts and many of Herman Mankiewiecz's contemporaries. I do, mostly because I am a retired history teacher and old film nut...but I am also not the average person. For them, I really feel sorry, as the film bounces back and forth in time and involves all sorts of people long dead....and soon to be forgotten.*

The story is a semi-fictionalized biography of Herman Mankiewiecz and it centers on how he wrote ""Citizen Kane"". The problem is that the movie goes on the assumption that he pretty much completely wrote the script and based it upon his contact with Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies. While this is true...it's partially true according to most sources. The contributions of John Houseman and, especially, Orson Welles, are almost completely ignored by the film. So, my advice is don't take the film as the gospel truth...though I do appreciate how the film also manages, at least a bit, to show that Marion Davies was NOT the talentless idiot she was shown to be in ""Citizen Kane""...something that just seemed cruel from that screenplay.

Overall, I found the film fascinating and with some excellent performances. But it's also not a film that I loved...mostly because it seemed to have an agenda...one that was more important that giving the entire truth.

*This film is full of inside jokes and cleverness that completely passes over the heads of most viewers and that annoyed me a bit. For example, when talking about the author Upton Sinclair, one comment made was that someone was so dumb that they thought he wrote ""Elmer Gantry""...a book, incidentally, that was written by Sinclair Lewis (though they never explained this confusion nor why it is easy to make for most people). This just seemed awfully elitist.",1
2642,"E muito se ouve ao falar do filme 'Cidadão Kane' no curso de jornalismo mas os bastidores acredito que poucos devem saber.
Com um tom de filme antigo da época especificamente dos anos 50, que era gravado em preto e branco, ela se assemelha na fala, na troca de cena, que dá aquele 'Fade Out' típico desses filmes.

Um destaque para a coadjuvante interpretada por Amanda Seyfried 'Marion Davies' que até achei que era a Bette Davies' (HaHa!) sem falar no Gary Oldman no papel de Herman J. Mankiewicz, os dois tem vários momentos juntos, percebia que o que eles tinham era algo além de uma amizade.

Dentre prazos e prazos Herman realmente não conseguia terminar de escrever seu roteiro, além que ele teria que lutar para ser levado a sério, e no fim de tudo e o esforço feito ele consegue ser um grande sucesso ganhando seu Oscar, Mank é um filme que eu diria ser para muitos difícil de decifrá-lo, é necessário ter olhar aos detalhes.
É de extrema importância Herman J Mankiewicz para o cinema, e o filme relatou bem os bastidores que não conhecíamos.

Mank é aquele filme que tem um conteúdo muito parecido com filmes antigos dos anos 50, foi necessário assistir e voltar umas duas vezes para entendê-lo pois é complexo.
Na visão do autor se via a demora o roteiro de 'Cidadão Kane', muitos desacreditaram da sua história, mas ele prosseguiu e conseguiu o sucesso.",1

Okay, so this movie was weird. I've seen some weird films, but this was up there. That's not to say I didn't like it, because I did. It kept me entertained the entire time I watched it. But it was not at all what I expected. It was extremely funny and I would say I laughed far more than I was scared. In fact, I didn't find the movie remotely scary until the last 15-20 minutes, and then it was a bit of a suspense/thriller more than a horror. In fact, I honestly wouldn't even call this movie a horror film. I'm not really sure why it's listed under horror - I would put it under comedy/suspense/thriller I guess. I don't know…this movie is hard to categorize. If you want my breakdown, there is one below to give you more details.

Overall Plot: 6/10
I know the plot should probably be a higher rating. The reason it is not is that it is a very simple plot and I didn't really love their choice of how they played it out. I don't feel like this is a spoiler, because they basically tell you the plot in the summary, but this movie is about two writers who spend the evening telling each other scary stories. However, instead of actually playing those stories out, which you expect from a *movie*, they have the two main actors act out the scenes. Which is creative, definitely, but I think I would have preferred to see the stories if you are going to bill this as a horror film. Watching them act out scenes was not at all scary - but it is perfect if you bill it as a comedy.

Plot Creativity: 8/10
I really think this movie was extremely creative. As I said, it was not at all what I expected, which is saying a lot because I am a writer myself and I can almost always predict movies and TV shows to the point where my husband is constantly accusing me of watching things without him. Now, that's not to say I didn't predict the ending of this film, which I did. I actually thought it would end a lot worse than it did. But this movie was definitely creative. I mean, even though I didn't prefer the way they told their scary stories, the fact that they did have the actors act out the scenes instead of just moving into actual separate movie scenes to play it out, was unique. I have not seen that done before which makes it creative.

Acting: 9/10
The acting in this movie was excellent. Josh Rubin and Aya Cash were the two main stars, with Chris Redd and Rebecca Drysdale being the only two co-stars. There were only four actors in this movie, which is another part of its creativity, I suppose because that does not often happen. I believed every character and I think they were very well played and portrayed. I honestly wasn't sure who would be the villain in the end, although I did predict it. What I mean is, even though I predicted who it would be, the movie did a pretty good job of making me doubt myself. Great job!

Character Likeability: 8/10
Surprisingly, I liked the characters. Even though both Josh's and Aya's characters had dislikeable things about them (more realistic honestly) I still really liked them both. I also really liked Chris' character. Not only were they well-acted, but they were also well-written in my opinion. They could have been better because I probably won't remember them in the future as I do some other characters, but they were definitely likable. More than I thought they would be during the first 20-30 minutes of the film.

Dialogue: 8/10
I feel like this movie was written by a screenwriter(s) who truly enjoys books. I could tell that they were avid readers and I enjoyed the dialogue a lot. I couldn't rate it higher because I honestly don't have any lines that I can remember, but they were truly good when watched at the time. Very realistic, funny, and interesting dialogue which truly made the movie, because there were little to no visuals. The dialogue (with plenty of sound effects) was the entire movie.

Ending Satisfaction: 8/10
As I said earlier in this post, I did predict the ending, but the writing did have me doubting myself several times. I didn't know exactly how it would turn out, but I guessed who the villain would be and turned out to be right. I found the ending semi-satisfying, although not perhaps as satisfying as it could have been. There were some things I would have changed as it was very…abrupt. But I can't say more without spoilers. Still, I was happy.

Overall Enjoyability: 8/10
Overall, I really enjoyed this movie as a comedy. As I said earlier, it was not scary. They tried to do some jump scares but I have seen so many horror films that they didn't work on me at all. I would love to compare it to other films but I honestly can't think of anything to compare it to because I have never seen a movie quite like this one. I think the reason I connected with it so much was that it is about the struggles of writing - how hard it is to be creative as a writer, to not steal or borrow from the work of others, and to struggle with writer's block or thinking you just aren't up to the standards of other writers. Even thinking that some writers are just lucky (looking at you Stephanie Meyers), even though most really great writers became great through hard work (J.R.R. Tolkien, Stephen King, etc.). I wouldn't watch this movie again, because of the lack of visuals, but I would definitely recommend it if you want something funny and different.",1
2664,ABSOLUTELY jaw dropping Directoral debut from Josh Ruben. Aya Cash steals every second she is in the film and Chris Redd shows up at the perfect time to inject a jolt of electricity into the story that completely catches you off guard in its final minutes! A++,1
2665,A delightful funny horror ride,1
2666,"Christ on the Cross! For the sake of the children, give expletives a rest! 

Folks, at the risk of sounding like an absolute prude, it's about time writers exit the juvenile phase of their evolution and ceases the proliferation of cuss words. We have come a long way since ‘Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' earned a hefty fine for MGM in the 40s, but that's another story. 

The writers' room is a salient voice in this all-consuming industry that ought to give a flying flamingo (borderline French for kiddies) when foul language becomes a prerequisite to telling a story. It does not, nor does it establish a character trait, compliment, or add power to expressing oneself; instead, it only demonstrates the lack of available and polite synonyms on the part of the writer. 

Ironically, given children are time-tenured, you would imagine writers who were little ones themselves were all fun and love and did not give a rat's bum (still passable) on what horror-flick was on the telly. They had to have the whole ""outrageous, unpredictable edge.""

The point is, notwithstanding the corny title when it comes to first impressions, children love Josh Ruben's Scare me, his writing, directional and acting debut. They would scowl, crawl and mimic his two-character dark masterpiece, but only if mum left them to their own devices. 

The little ones are inexplicably drawn to an array of colors like a moth to a flame, and when we adults scramble for the brakes at the stoplights, we are unwittingly shooting askance in that general direction.

That said, Ruben is brilliant for his triple effort. He gives drama students a tutorial on completely disappearing into a badass troll with a range of emotions in a single take. Still, he could use some cues from Andrew Kevin Walker, his contemporary, or perhaps align with the likes of Noel Coward (good heavens, it's a tall order), his predecessor, for some solid kiddie-friendly entertainment. 

Peace!

Words, Tommy Peters.

2667,"This is a good pick when you’re in the mood for something different. A successful writer and an aspiring but struggling writer-to-be meet by chance when they both rent isolated cabins in the woods. When the power goes out, they decide to spend their time trying to scare each other with stories. The movie is fun at points and uncomfortable at others as the tension builds between the leads. The ending was interesting and well done, but somewhat predictable at the same time. There’s a chance I’ll be updating my rating as the distance between myself and the movie widens. As I’m somewhat stumped by how I feel about it, i consider it a compliment to the everyone involved with the film. ",1

Unique concept for a movie, and boy it could have been amazing if there had been a more talented director.",0

All in all mostly a wasted opportunity, but a very unique one.",0
2673,Fascinating story. You don't have to be a fan of The Band or Robbie Robertson.,1
2674,I really enjoyed it . ,1
2675,"Haters are gonna hate, but regardless of your feelings about Robbie Robertson, Once Were Brothers is a remarkably insightful documentary about the iconic band The Band.  Covering the early years as The Hawks, backing up ‘Rompin' Ronnie Hawkins, to touring with Dylan after he went electric to their years working out of Woodstock to their final show as documented in The Last Waltz, it is informative and joyous and tragic and, most importantly, wildly entertaining.  Fans of The Band will enjoy the behind-the-scenes footage and stills.  The uninitiated will find it a primer for understanding the early years of rock and roll.",1
2676,"Good documentary, but this is Robbie Roberson's one-sided version of what happened.  Levon and others disagree.",0
2677,"Every time I watch or read something about musicians I end up disappointed, except for the Beatles & David Bowie. I liked a few of The Band's hits. I find it very sad that Robertson couldn't share his fortune from royalties. Levon Helm was right in being upset because without him the songs were only words on paper. Greed is a terrible thing.",0
2678,"As said regarding ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,"" the 2020 HBO documentary about the Bee Gees: to the victor go the spoils. In the context of both the Bee Gees' documentary and The Band's documentary, ""Once We Were Brothers,"" the victors are those who live longest, and ""the spoils"" is control of the bands' narratives. While Garth Hudson is still alive--and as recently several years ago struggling with health issues, in poverty, in Woodstock NY, having to resort to selling off many of his possessions to pay medical bills--he appears little in this film. Which is interesting. And disappointing. And....not terribly surprising. 

Although I don't remember all the details, I contributed to a GoFundMe for Garth in the past decade, and recall that he and the other members of The Band (i.e., those who are not Robbie Robertson) believe themselves to have been shafted in terms of composition credit and royalties. So, I'm inferring from his lack of presence in this film--in fact, lack of any contemporaneous mention by Robertson or this film, beyond a 1-line epilogue stating Garth lives in Upstate NY with his wife--that either Garth Hudson chose not to participate, is not healthy enough to participate, or Robbie Robertson decided he didn't want to include him. 

As a result of the aforementioned--i.e., everyone from The Band is dead, not counting Garth Hudson, who is simply absent--the only contemporaneous voice represented in Once Were Brothers is Robbie Robertson. Now, I don't dislike Robbie Robertson, but from the first time I saw The Last Waltz, in middle school, I knew he was a showboater. A handsome (at least then) and charismatic showboater, but one nonetheless. He has no qualms with that, and in fact implies that no one understood him and his zeal for Big Success until his mother Dolly revealed to him as a teenager the identity of his real father, who was Jewish, and upon meeting each other the Jewish side of the family immediately embraced his ambition and drive, encouraging him to strive when no one else had previously done so. Be that as it may, showboater or not, Robertson tells the story of The Band much in the way Barry Gibb told the story of The BeeGees, without attempt to be objective, nor to include narratives that may make him look anything but virtuous, the most talented, the most sane, and center stage at all times (now and throughout either bands' history). 

""Once Were Brothers"" is based on Robertson's autobiography, so I don't fault him for the project's self-centeredness, but believe it would have been fairer to have named it something closer to the autobiography title: ""Testimony: A Memoir by Robbie Robertson."" However, since there is no other semi-comprehensive documentary about The Band (I consider The Last Waltz to be what it was--a concert film), therefore--again--despite its heavy Robbie Robertson tilt, for better or worse, it is going to function as The Band's definitive documentary. 

To the positive, lots of great footage from throughout the years--much of it I'd never seen before, some of which I recognized as outtakes from The Last Waltz (which, fortunately, were available to Once Were Brothers' filmmaker Scorsese, since Scorsese....also made The Last Waltz)--and some engaging interview snippets from well-known musicians about the band (although [1] not a fraction as many as one might have imagined nor would have been desirable, and [2] many of these recent interviews probably did came to fruition due to the Scorsese connection. An enjoyably barely coherent brogueing Van Morrison stood out for me, since one seems him so seldom. 

Some music critics have observed ""bitterness"" in Robbie Robertson in this film. For me, 120 of the film's 140 minutes were quite riveting and positive. At 1 hour 20 minutes there was a shift in tone where I didn't perceive Robertson to be bitter as much as defensive and a smidge self-righteous about his legacy vs the rest of The Bands'. That didn't matter to me as much as I might have expected--because I adored Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, and especially Rick Danko. However, as I felt about Barry Gibb in the BeeGee's documentary, I wouldn't expect great depth, complexity, reflection, or insights from Robbie Robertson. 

Robertson did a yeoman's job with The Band, was a more than competent guitarist, is wholly unique songwriter of archteypeal tunes, and was massively focused and driven. But that doesn't mean he is particularly introspective. And it shows in this film. 

It's absolutely worth 4 stars, but it also absolutely is ""Robbie Robertson Telling His Story of The Band,"" rather than The Story of The Band. I dock the film 1 star for Robertson's very likely being a dick of a person, and not giving adequate credit where credit was due to the other band members, in terms of their foundational contribution to the songs' creation and therefore royalties--and legacy. Whenever Robertson would be saying things like he rushed to Levon's deathbed but it was too late so he whispered ""See ya on the other side, my Brother"" I found myself making ""I smell bullshit"" faces. Among other reasons: everyone knew Levon was ill, so Robertson had plenty of time to make amends, but he probably knew Levon would expend his last puff of air telling him to go to Hell; and beyond that he just seemed treacly and sentimental, for the cameras. 

However, gauging the film more or less on its own merits, it does deserve 4**** and if you're at all a The Band fan, or music and popular culture of that era, it's a must-see.",1

2683,"Incredibly moving, yet often distracted, 'The Way I see It' feels like an idealized version of events from the eyes of the White House photographer under Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan.  When the movie veers into blaming everything that went wrong on Donald Trump it lost me.  When the pictures tell the story, tears will flow, especially if you have young kids.  Dawn Porter once again is way too heavy handed with her point of view and too soft with little to no journalistic integrity.  Final Score: 6/10",0
2684,"Very moving portrayal of a great American president. Highly enjoyable two hours examining how a president with charm, compassion and intellect can affect lives .",1
2685,Pete Souza provides an in-depth account about his personal observations and knowledge of the Presidency.  The movie was a perfect example to show character and experience is required to be President.   Anyone who gave this movie less than 4 stars should walk into the ocean forever.,1
2686,"The sensational director, Dawn Porter, did it again with another entertaining and powerful documentary, The Way I See It! Porter is a genius at creating films based on inspiring images of her subjects and letting the pictures tell the story. The timing of this film is perfect because of upcoming Presidential elections and how it shows historic moments in the lives of past respectable Presidents through photos from the eyes of  official White House photographer Pete Souza.

The Way I See It is a documentary based on Souza's New York Times #1 bestsellers, Obama: An Intimate Portrait and Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents. It gives an inside look of two powerful Presidents in U.S. history, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, through photographs taken by Pete Souza. It tells the story through clips from interviews and unique photos and shows the responsibilities of being the person holding the most powerful position on Earth.

Pete Souza was able to get an ""up close and personal"" look at monumental and intimate moments of former President Barack Obama and President Ronald Reagan during their terms. The setting of the film is at the White House.The scenes are very realistic because they are based on factual events. The documentary includes heartwarming clips and moments such as when these Presidents gave their speeches while running for office, their lives outside of being Presidents and just having fun. The music in this film really helps drive the story.

I love that The Way I See It  did not feel like just a documentary meant to show how America is in the state it is in now. The message of the film is that we have to look at our past to understand how we get to a certain place in life. While the film doesn't really talk about President Trump, it shows that our country was in a better place before he became President.

I rate The Way I See It 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18. Adults that like documentaries and history will also love this film. By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",1

Great reenactments of trial scenes, that were turned into a grotesques circus. With authentic Italian hand gesturing all around.
However, the acting sometimes slips into borderline comedy and chaff. The extensive hallucination scenes and metaphorical allusions to themes are really blunt and movie really hammers them in, leaving really few ones for interpretation.",1

2708,"""Timmy Failure"" is one of the few original movie offerings on Disney+ and it is among the worst I have seen on the platform. This movie is clearly aimed at kids, but I can't imagine kids would like it much because the story is bland and undeveloped. I think there was a lot of potential to explore deeper themes when the main character has such an overactive imagination, but they don't do much with it. I understand that the main character is supposed to be cute or charming, but I mostly found him to be kind of annoying. I completely empathized with the adults who were frustrated by his antics in the movie. Overall, the movie might be fine for really young audiences, but I can't imagine adults finding much value in this movie.",0
2709,"Forgettable.

'Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made' is, simply put, not very good. The execution of the plot is underwhelming, while the ultra dry nature of the humour becomes tiresome quickly. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt for the most part, with the expectation of a decent pay off at the end... but that doesn't arrive.

Winslow Fegley (brother of Oakes Fegley from 'Pete's Dragon') is alright in the lead, but the only cast member I'll remember is Craig Robinson - I, truly, liked his character, Mr. Jenkins. Ophelia Lovibond and Wallace Shawn are OK, I guess. I don't really have anything against the cast, to be honest.

It's just everything else that gives this film a low rating from me. I will say I do like a few aspects. For example, there's a cool CGI polar bear from start-to-finish, but it literally never does anything of note. I also get the message they were aiming for, but they don't quite get there. I did find the dialogue good, in parts, though.

It's harmless and, evidently, some will find enjoyment in this. For me, it isn't anything worth noting in terms of Disney releases.",0

2713,"Sold as an urban mythological romance and a paean to the city of Berlin, German writer-director, Christian Petzold's new film begins with Paula Beer's mysterious and lonely Undine, an architectural historian, mid-rendezvous with her lover who's dumping her for another woman. Almost immediately after, there's a rather Germanic meet-cute which brings Franz Rogowski's shy and reserved industrial diver, Christoph, into the picture and the two begin a romantic courtship over the rest of the film. Since it was never explained what an Undine is, (for the benefit of those who like me has to google it: according to European mythology, it's a water nymph that becomes human after finding love but have to return to water if her partner becomes unfaithful) I was left rather bewildered during the film which follows closely the above mythology. Without that background knowledge, the story feels rather odd and baffling. In fact, even on reflection with the understanding what she's meant to be, there are parts of the film that still don't make total sense. Also unclear, or at least something that sits rather uneasily with me, is the juxtaposition of this mythical creature with the re-generation of the city of Berlin between WWII and its reunification that the film spends quite a bit of time on. So despite fine performances by the central leads and passionate and competent handling of the material by Petzold, I remain curious but tepid about the whole thing and I fear that a more cynical viewer such as I will not be entirely receptive to the romantic notions, both for the lovers and the city, that the film is attempting to convey. Or in the words of a parting lover: it's not you, it's me.",0
2714,"The piano music and the end scene makes all the difference with this film. Mid way through I felt it was a little bland and I wasn't sure of the plot direction but I thought it was somewhat touching by the very end. The musical score makes a big difference, its subtle but certainly not non-existent. It is most certainly an understated film and it may bore some people, its very much an arty film of course and its hardly gripping viewing but its thoughtful and ok at the end. I don't think I'd have persevered with this, had I not paid to view it. This is an ok film overall, no more really.",0
2715,"Word to the wise: Watch this film with an open mind! I spent the entire movie searching for an answer to oddities and came up empty handed, only to find that the explanation was something that I never in a MILLION years would have imagined. Perhaps that was my ignorance and I should have known that Undine's are water nymphs, but I have a feeling that is not common knowledge. Overall, the acting was quite good and I found the incorporation of Berlin's history to be a nice touch. I would have liked this better without the mythical tone, but can appreciate it all the same.",0

2719,"Beer and Rogowski carry this somewhat slight work by the wonderful German director Christian Petzold. Their onscreen connection as lovers Undine and Christoph, playing off one another so well, so convincing in their love and devotion, has led to two successful films so far, though Undine does not quite match the fire of Transit.
The film could've used a bit more of the mythmaking of the Undine legend. The supernatural possibilities of that story could've fleshed out the one we see with more symbolism/imagery to create a greater overall impression on the audience. 
I'm not sure how much Petzold was trying to make correlations between the changes in Berlin over time and those in human life, how we alter the architecture of our lives with the people we love most like a city's core is replaced by attempts to improve on or leave behind less desirable memories. He falls short at times.
Also great here is Maryam Zaree as another love interest, but one grounded purely in reality, and whose love for Christoph is without question. I did quite like the final scene, down to the final image and what I took from it. I may need to see this again soon. 3.3 stars",1

Not much is explained about who Undine is, where she came from, or what becomes of her. Could have been much more of a movie, the director may have made it for an audience to whom Undine as a character is a familiar childhood story that doesn't need explaining.",0

2729,"This is an atmospheric and sobering watch - a glimpse into what life was like for people in the USSR at the time. Its a thoughtful watch - a chilling depiction of the harm in turning a blind eye or ignoring what those in power do. It features someone reading a particularly poignant quote from George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'. The fact some British people seemingly glossed over the realities they didn't entirely like, made me cringe a bit, its fair to say. I also thought James Norton gave a good performance. Even though it is understandable a bit of a bleak watch, it is also somehow rather gripping, certainly towards the end, although I should perhaps point out that there's some shaky camerawork also present towards the end, which may (or may not) bother viewers. Also there are subtitles at numerous times, which is perhaps not surprising given its partly set abroad but that, again, may or may not be an issue for some. Otherwise I thought its a pretty solid film really.

The Soviets are exporting almost all Ukrainian grain out of country - that's where the money is coming from. It's ""Stalin's gold.""

Yes its about fighting against the opressive government/society/employers etc. 'the system' but its also a romance story and a story about a writer trying to find his feet (and his voice). The script is decent and I thought it was quite a gripping watch really. Yes, I would recommend this film, though its perhaps a bit of a challenging watch thematically but its certainly not entirely the gloom and doom I somehow imagined it to be (maybe I'm wearing rose tinted spectacles?).

Eden is a sailor living a roustabout life with little education. He rescues a young man at the docks and is taken home to his family, the Orsinis. The Orsinis live a rich life of wealth and art and science. Eden falls in love with their daughter, Elena, and also vows to make himself educated and become a writer. The journey is a fruitful one and a long one. It's engaging and triumphant. The film is a heady mix of sex, politics and high idealism. All of which is anchored by a magnetic performance by Luca Marinelli. A film of high ambition and firm ideas.",1
2737,"Based on Jack London's 1909 novel of the same name, Pietro Marcello's adaptation transposes the location of the story from California to Naples to stunning effect. Early on, Martin, who lives with his sister and her husband and their young children, rescues Arturo from a beating on a Napoli pier. So grateful is Arturo, he insists on bringing Martin to his family home so they can thank him in person. This is where Martin meets Elena, Arturo's sister, and falls hopelessly in love with her. It's a tale as old as time and indeed the novel on which it is based is over a century old. The cultured and refined Elena is not only the beacon to which Martin looks to romantically, it's her social status and class that Martin sets his heart on. As someone born into poverty, he's not had the same opportunities that Elena and her family have, and he aspires to reach her intellectual level at great cost and constant obstacles. Despite the problems posed by society and social structures, Martin is determined to be successful, and we are drawn into his quest with some truly superb acting by Luca Marinelli (who should draw awards attention with this performance) as well as his peers. We are given fascinating snippets of both Martin's earlier life and contextualised old stock film footage in frequent edits that give the film a haunting beauty, a feeling that never leaves, especially in its more tragic moments. Martin Eden is perfectly paced, merging the criteria of both a romantic drama and a something like a biopic to wonderful effect. It takes a an excellent romance film to fully draw me in, but the screenplay combined with the acting leave you no choice. Martin is no stranger to frollicking; his social class and upbringing doesn't leave much option for celibacy, but when he and Elena finally declare their love for each other, it's clear that it's something neither of them have experienced before. ""I've never loved before,"" says a breathless Elena. ""Let's learn together,"" replies Martin, in just one of a dozen achingly beautiful sequences. The film takes a political turn in the final third, brilliantly whipping up conflict between the pair as Martin turns to socialist circles to try and understand and impact his own world more effectively, and this brings him into dissension with Elena; right at a time that it seems Martin's dream to be a writer could have some traction. I urge you to seek it out.",1
2738,"Ambitious is a good word, became a bit one-note for me though.  And the personal transformation a bit unbelievable.",0
2739,"I recommend at least reviewing the Wikipedia page on Jack London's novel so you know the backstory of early 20th century political philosophy. This is an artistic film and I am not surprised about the gap between professional reviews and us mere mortals. However, if you enjoy films for which you think you should be able to get college credit this may be for you.

Some of the subtitles are washed out against white background, however the rich visual palette carries the story. (If you are fluent in Italian this won't be a problem)",1
2740,"I liked this film mainky for its artistic value. I like how it is film and how it is acted. However, the last 30 mins are quite chaotic and frankly non-sensical. Not for everyone.",1
2741,"I have a feeling this is less profound of an adaptation than the filmmakers think, that said I do appreciate the performances and the ending.",0
2742,"Aside from losing the girl from the beginning, it elegantly shows the struggles of a true marxist in the early 20th century. The film shoots its scenes like ""Bad Taste (1987)"" and ""Slumber Party Massacre 2 (1990)"". The head on shots show how divided he is between his friends opinions and his opinions, I think.",1
2743,"I thought this was a reasonably well made film based on a true story. I'm a little uncomfortable that its categorised as a comedy - the issue of womens rights and the objectification of young women is hardly a laughing matter and if anything such issues have only got worse in the following decades. I suppose there are some moments where the activists are shown in high spirits, which may cheer you but I wouldn't say any of it is exactly laugh out loud material. I'd heard about the true story before (having seen a documentary about it on the BBC a few years back), so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought both Keira Knightley and Jessie Buckley gave good performances, probably moreso Jessie Buckley, who is someone I really rate for her performances. If your interested in seeing the story played out in all its 1970 era bright colours and naffness, you'll find that here certainly - its a good film to potentially start discussion about feminism maybe and generally I thought it's a good film. Maybe not quite good but decent enough to be worth a watch, yes. Oh and I particularly liked that at the end, we're given details about what happened to the characters via text and shown images of the real people who were involved in real life as well - that always helps with such true life stories. If I was given the choice, I'd prefer to watch the BBC documentary with library footage of the actual event, rather than re-watch this film but it is a fairly rounded film none the less.",1
2744,"Set in 1970 during the Miss World pageant held in London, a group of women make a plan to disrupt the proceedings in one of the first big women's liberation movements.  Keira Knightley and Jesse Buckley star as well as Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Greg Kinnear as Bob Hope.  Interesting film based on true events and people.  Buckley as always is a standout.",0
2745,An interesting story. Well done. I recommend.,1
2746,"Misbehaviour aims to anger and inflame, but it's all too polite and proper to ruffle any feathers. For such a big event in history, the film doesn't offer the pay off we wanted. A stellar cast help it to behave though.",0
2747,"I know it's hard to believe that a film directed by, written by and starring women about a 'women's issue' is derided on the internet, but here we are. In reality, this is a really good film about two different sides of injustice, and how those searching for liberation engage with each other when two just agendas might appear to be in conflict. Excellent performances, and the light comic tone doesn't lessen the impact.",1
2748,"Flawed, but its energetic and vivid story-telling  alongside stellar performances achieve creating a compelling film that benefits from important and timely themes.",1
2749,"A movie with a stellar cast and based around such a great story could only be commandeered by a radical left group of disillusioned man haters in Hollywood. 

If the filmmakers had focused more on racial equality during the time period and the significanceof the events the film depicts, it could have had such a lasting impact with such a talented cast. Unfortunately, instead, it was crafted into a tool for a misguided cult to take shots at a fictional 21st century Civil rights issue known as the patriarchal society.

What a colossal disappointment.",0
2750,"'Misbehaviour' tells three different stories intermingled.  The centerpiece is the 1970 Miss World competition and just about everything offshoots from that.  Bob Hope loves women and the women's liberation movement loves women's rights.  Greg Kinnear portrays Hope.  Well sometimes he does.  Other times he's just himself with some distracting makeup.  While I didn't know anything about this story, it's safe yet fine.  It's not deep and eager to make you feel good, so much so, it takes away from what in my opinion the film should have been about.  Also, there's a lot of filler here.  Can't anyone write a movie for a big studio?  A person of color winning is almost glossed over, which may have been the goal, but it didn't work for me.  Final Score: 5.0/10",0
2751,"Misbehaviour is a solidly executed —- albeit formulaic —- retelling of a grossly under-explored part of our history, and boasts enough spectacle and feel-good moments to stay watchable —— even compelling thanks to the strength of its powerhouse female cast. Though unlike the strong women at its centre, it's a shame that those behind the camera quite often lack the strength to reach below the subject's sensationalistic surface.

2759,"Actually better than the first film, simply for the addition of his adorable daughter. There was at least a little less toilet humour too, which was so damned crude in the first movie. 

I've read that Sacha Cohen deliberately made this movie as a warning. He included extremist political views in order to show how dangerous they are, and how bad it would be if Trump got elected the second time. He says so himself, then ends the movie with the message that people should vote. But it's still very crude, and again I feel that even though it's meant to be sarcastic, the people who really have these racist, sexist, and homophobic attitudes probably enjoy the hell out of seeing themselves getting attention like this.",0

2761,"I love the Borat character and was curious how they could follow up the hugely successful first one.  In this one Borat is tasked by his government to bring a gift mod a famous monkey to Vice President Mike Pence, however things go awry when his teenage daughter escapes her cage and stows away with the monkey.  Smart idea to use the daughter character to integrate with the unsuspecting marks in the awkward situations with real people and putting Borat in disguise due to people recognizing him.  
Not nearly as side splittingly funny as the original but a fun follow up.",0

2763,"Silly and idiotic, this film is a perfect respite from the heavy-handed emotional films that pervade the industry. Gilliam Jacobs(Fear street part 1-3, Community) is as fun as she always is, although her voice...so loud. Supporting cast is above average, Rammel Chan(Matthew Lee; Thin Red Line (TV)) steals his scenes and newcomer Cindy Gold is a standout as well. If you are looking for a simple predictive fun movie, this is for you. Recommended for all although buffs and critics may scoff at its simpleness.",1
2764,"Almost, but not quite. 
Kinda boring tbh...in an attempt at light hearted tragedy/comedy.",0
2765,"In somewhat the same vein as (the superior film) ""Liberal Arts,"" Gillian Jacobs' lead performance is appealing and relatively believable in its depiction of an early-mid-life crisis, when her literary first effort bombs just after she realizes that her marriage plan wouldn't work either.",1
2766,Funny and lighthearted,1
2767,A sweet little film examining what it is like to confront the shortcomings the approach to middle age can confront one with. This really runs on Gillian Jacobs' performance which exudes a natural confidence while embodying a character who is questioning that same quality in themselves.,0
2768,I Used to Go Here is a small but very amiable comedy about adulthood and making a success of your life. It has many charms with a small dash of substance. Kate has just had her first book published but the reviews are not great and her upcoming book tour has been cancelled by her publisher. She receives an invitation from her former professor to come back to college for a speaking engagement. This leads to her mixing in with the local students and also her reevaluating her life and where whe needs to go. It's not a hugely funny film but there are nice moments of humour and nice conversations about life and how we define success. Gillian Jacobs is very good in the lead role and all around the acting is fine and well observed. A good film with charm without being a great one.,1
2769,"Unassuming, understated, and unlike our heroine's book for which she is on tour for, uninterested in trying to be what it's not. I Used to Go Here is a wistful and nostalgic college dramedy from the perspective of a woman returning to her alma mater to discuss her book with current students. Unfortunately, none of its characters stand out much and its script is very scattershot. It is enjoyable and funny throughout, but doesn't do enough to feel more than a cozy little movie.",0
2770,Needs more Clement action,0

2773,"Absolutely incredible. Pacing is slow but I never felt impatient with any of the moments. Compelling and true to life. Also if you are trans, watch this, it's well done.",1
2774,"While this story of an undocumented transgender Filipino care giver seeking to find a way to legally remain stateside stems from a potentially engaging premise, it never goes anywhere once launched. The film's slight, underdeveloped narrative, with its many story threads that never fully pan out, yields a picture that flails about in search of focus. That's unfortunate, because writer-director Isabel Sandoval's latest has a rich vein of material to draw from if only it were given the development needed to make it flourish cinematically. What viewers are left with is a meandering piece with lots of long, lingering, gorgeously photographed shots that add little to a story that doesn't know where it ultimately wants to go.",0
2775,"A dramatic, yet soft romantic story with implicit overtones built on the traumatic intersection of transsexualism and illegal immigration. A quiet movie with a message that is best felt rather than explained.",1
2776,"Moved a bit too slowly, but watching the relationship dance was interesting.  As was the ICE dance.",0
2777,"Isabel Sandoval wrote, directed, produced and starred in a film about an undocumented trans Filipino caregiver who pursues a marriage to obtain a green card.  First off, can we all be thankful that movies from diverse voices are being given a platform more and more frequently?  As much as that means to me, it doesn't excuse the filmmaker from being sloppy and leaving wide gaps in the story that don't make the film feel authentic.  There are several great ideas here, but mixed together they work as well as oil and water.  People are too reactionary which defies logic considering how quickly and forced these conflicts and resolutions are.  While we have to accept the fact that this is a first-time filmaker, we can't just forgive the movie's faults out of sympathy.  This is a story that needs to be SPOT on and not only engaging, but lose the viewer.  Instead, I was left wondering why certain characters after being developed, just vanished.  A trans woman who takes care of an elderly woman with dementia, combined with a romance of her grandson combined with that evil character who just seems drawn to scale.  I hope Sandoval gets another chance because she shows so much promise.  I just wish there had been another pass or two at a largely invisible script.  Trans voices are a necessity in film and this is worthy of a watch for the sole fact it treats the typically voiceless with dignity and respect.  I just wish it was a better film. Finally, I caught this on Netflix and may I suggest how to watch?  There are two ways and considering there are three languages used, I strongly suggest using captions.  Now, this is going to be annoying because there's no way just to caption the two foreign languages to the English speakers and instead you get captioned EVERY word that's said and EVERY move that's heard.  Considering the movie starts and ends in a language other than English.. you're just gonna have to show a little bit of trust.  The scene at the beginning is integral to the film.  Final Score: 5.8/10",0
2778,"Very, very slow movie. Don't bother.",0
2779,"S**t, this was a great movie.  A movie about people, not a bunch of made up drama to get people to watch.  This movie was much better than I expected, and I loved it.  Original everything, so interesting.  I have to agree more with the critics on this one.",1
2780,Well done!  Intelligent. Sensitive. I loved it!,1
2781,"Olivia (played by the director, Isabel Sandoval), a trans woman, is a Filipino undocumented immigrant in Brooklyn who is a caretaker for a lady who is suffering from dementia. As her options for getting a green card become fewer, she meets Alex, Olga's grandson, and a relationship develops between the two. I enjoyed this movie. It was nice seeing a film about a trans woman directed by a trans woman who plays the lead character in the film. There are two things I enjoyed most about the film. First, it is an interesting and believable character study of what it must be like to live in fear of immigration in America under the current president. The constant fear of someone tipping off immigration, or the risk of making a trip to the market, is always there. Second, while the relationship between Alex and Olivia was not always very believable, when it was, it worked as a story of two people who are trying to make a better life for themselves. The sense of place and time was well executed; it reminded me in some ways of the films of Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart) in how the films capture people living on the margins and how much of a part of the fabric of life in the city they are. Thumbs up from me for a film that isn't perfect but one whose story is sensitively told and generally well-acted.",1

2787,"This reminds me so much of ""Freaks and Geeks,"" with the tone and its somewhat real-to-life, coming-of-age high school moments. It actually feels so much like it, it should be a TV show where this story is half of a season, because as a movie, it doesn't do enough and I don't think it really utilized the chemistry between its two leads to its potential. But still good and Pete Davidson is way more enjoyable in this than he is in ""The King of Staten Island,"" which is weird considering this is more of a Judd Apatow feel.",0
2788,"Overall a great film. Acting is great Pete Davidson was Pete Davidson, hilarious. Machine Gun Kelly performed his lines very well and the rest of the cast did great. I genuinely can't think of one negative thing about this film. A MUST WATCH!",1

2790,Great coming of age movie. Great acting and comedy ,1

The movie is a well-acted blend of comedy and drama that will make you laugh and think about life overall. I highly recommend this film to everybody.",1
2792,A really good watch... Which delves into real teen issues and sometimes needing to let your friends go. Very Good!,1
2793,"Strange movie.  It wasn't without a creative spark or some intrigue though.  I felt bored for much of it before it got interesting.  I appreciated the human emotional dynamic that felt real.  It felt as though it was for a long time two different stories that didn't comprehensibly weave together until the end.  It was barely worth the once over.  I'm glad I only paid 1.99 to see it, but even that felt about 2x as much as it was worth to see.",0
2794,"It may not catch your attention right away, but it clearly has plenty to look out for.",1

As if Bonello just took two movies he wanted to make, couldn't decide, and smashed them together like child's play-dough, trying to make the two disparate parts into one franken-film whole. The worst and most utterly ridiculous parts occur during the teen-girl horror half of the film.

Having Nicholas Cage was the icing on the cake. What wonders this actor is capable of when allowed some freedom. Such a haunting film in the way it portrays the Color Out of Space.

2812,This is a Hard No ... not really sure what type of movie this really is.  Went to see Nicholas Cage and figured it would be at least half way decent.  If I was by myself I would have walked out.  There were attempts to add humor however they failed just like the theme to this movie.,0
2813,"With an extremely interesting and refreshing point of view, Selah and the Spades intelligently narrates the quasi-criminalistic divisions in a school and, although it feels a bit exaggerated at times, it does its job by painting a portrait of the youthful confusion brought to life by the great work of its young cast.",1

2819,"The entire movie falls flat. It tries to cultivate this intrigue and mystique but is more like a high school acting class- where not even the actors are convinced of what they are doing.

Painful waste.

2827,"A truly deep documentary about the rise of social media and how it effects our current lives and how it will effect out future if we don't change anything. From the inner workings of the AI's that run these platforms to how our own self image gets warped within our phones. It is really amazing and I think everyone should watch this so we can at least understand the super computer we keep in our back pockets. I like how they touched on many consequiences of social media, from the youtube rabbit holes to ""fake news"" to addiction to our current political climate. It really has touched so many different points that technology has created for us. I also enjoyed how there was a fictional story (probably based on many true stories) throughout the documentary underneath what the experts were saying. It gives example to how this social climate has effected people of all generations but especially the younger ones who were the first to really use this technonolgy when it was released. The documentary does create a sense of dread near the end as we see that if we don't chnage the way these systems function and hold them accountable of their actions then it could truly be a dangerous future. I know it is important to state but it does make me scared for the future. Honestly a fantastic documentary that anyone with a smartphone should watch.",1
2828,The documentary part of this really sucks in my opinion it sounds as if the people are over reacting and it is slow like seriously how is one of the guys in the documentary part addicted to gmail or was anyway the drama story part also was really bad the lighting was terrible and it felt over dramatised the only reason I gave this 1 star and not half a star is because it did make me laugh once in one of the A.I. parts with Vincent Kartheiser's,0

2835,"I can't rate this any lower due to Bill Murray being in it and being particularly, well...Bill Murray-ish. He doesn't appear for the first 20 minutes or so but I was interested enough in the main story, away from him, anyway so it wasn't too big an issue. I would say that by the end, I'm not sure if I was entirely convinced by what we're told happened but I found it a very enjoyable watch overall anyway. Murrays character, the ladies father, has plenty of slick one liners and manages to talk himself out of numerous situations, the usual. Its a very watchable and somewhat laidback of a film. I enjoyed it, so yes, I'd recommend it.",1

2837,"Marlon Wayans in a dramatic role? Don't see that every day.

On the Rocks is a perfectly okay movie. The father/daughter dynamic between Jones and Murray is the high point of the film, each with their own brand of charm and banter that masks character flaws and a degree of unresolved conflict; they're characters that clearly care for one another deeply while not necessarily agreeing on most aspects of their respective lifestyles. It's among the more straightforward films from writer-director Sofia Coppola and some of the elements certainly aren't the most subtle (with Murray's misogynistic and blunt mannerisms often coming off as thematically heavy-handed even if Murray as an actor feels very well-suited and convincing to the role), and the conflicts teeter on melodramatic territory, but overall the short runtime and the 'conversational' progression of the plot still make On the Rocks an entertaining if somewhat simple film, though not among Coppola's better outings. (3/5)",0
2838,"A charming cast and a promising premise that ends up getting watered down. It's a lowkey, charming piece that doesn't fully get its feet off the ground and reach the heights it could have, in performance and in story.",0
2839,"On The Rocks is a comedy with a light touch exploring relationships and their infidelities. Laura Keane (Rashida Jones) suspects her husband (Marlon Wayans) of cheating on her while having an interjecting father (Bill Murray) who was himself a ladies man. Sofia Coppola presents an honest self-portrait or an artist dealing with domesticity bringing a charm that shines the brightest through Murray and Jones's exchanges.

Coppola constructs an authentic and complex version of masculinity through Bill Murray - one that is deeply flawed through his desire to be loved, his opinions of femininity beauty, and desire to fix in others what he has done wrong. The flavorful overlaying eccentricity of the character withstanding. However, I wish more conversation time was spent between Wayans and Jones which would have solidified the juxtaposition of Murray and Wayans variations on masculinity with Jones being caught in the middle.

On The Rocks is everything you think it will be but the journey to get there is charmingly enjoyable and always engaging. Especially from the always charismatic, charming and eccentric Bill Murray.",1
2840,Way too dragged out. Didn't like it.,0
2841,"1. It isn't a comedy.
2. Really tired of grown men and women who still blame their parents.
3. Just a box of ugliness quietly wrapped.",0
2842,Just okay.  A bit of a waste of the talents of Rashida Jones & Bill Murphy.  The story seemed a bit weak.  I should have known better.  I generally am not impressed with offerings of Sofia Coppola nor A24.,0
2843,Was really surprise by this film and singing in it was really good.  Was really refreshing to see a younger person being mentor by old person and the younger person not being a know it all.,1
2844,"Fresh, sweet and also poignant. Explores the dilemma of undocumented immigrants and the brutal deportation system, but also the courage and talent of a teen girl with Filipino heritage struggling to become a country singer/songwriter in Texas. Different and appealing.",1
2845,"Touching story of Rose, an undocumented Filipina teen, living in Texas. After her mother is picked up by ICE, Rose is left with some difficult choices and circumstances. While trying to navigate life as an illegal immigrant, in fear of being deported, Rose pursues her dream of being a country singer-songwriter, meeting some supportive and caring folks along the way. This understated film is very well acted by the entire cast and though the story is simple it tugs at your heartstrings. I like that the teen romance took a back seat and was just a small facet of the film and there was more focus on the songwriting and the music. which is beautiful and emotionally sung by the actress Eva Noblezada (Rose) and country musician Dale Watson, who also stars in the film (as well as a beautiful Filipino lullaby sung by Lea Salonga.) . Rated PG-13 for a few (authentic and not just for the heck of it) swear words. A beautifully told story IMHO! 5/2021",1
2846,"The scripting could have been better. It seemed like a first attempt. Mostly, it suffered one major flaw;  given that much of the movie was about singing, there wasn't nearly enough of that in the movie.  But it wasn't terrible.",0
2847,This movie is full of delicate and beautiful scenes.,1
2848,This is a unique topic and for that it gets serious credit. There is some poor writing along the way that makes this movie drag. So close to good. Just not quite there. There are many beautiful marks that are hit in this movie. It's the ones that are left hanging that leave you longing.,0
2849,"When it's not preachy, Yellow Rose is an excellent film.  It tackles a serious issue (Immigration), and combines a coming of age love story and an unlikely friendship.  It's not perfect, but it's genuine.  I cried tears of sadness and tears of joy for a film that is hopeful.  Lots of smiles!  Final Score: 8/10",1
2850,This is a beautiful coming of age movie with the twist while making her way.  A surprise appearance by Dale Watson rounds out an excellent cast that makes for a heartwarming story of picking yourself up from tough circumstances,1
2851,"Apart from the irritating mother, this was pretty good.",1
2852,"Yellow Rose is a movie that holds a lot of promise, and doesn't really ever deliver. I can't shake the feeling (even at the end of the movie) that everyone simply used Rose. The fact that no one seems to want to really help her, and only want her around as long as it benefits them. Not her mother (abandons Rose for Manila), not her ""friend"" (wants a romantic relationship), not the Aunt (prefers her comfort / abusive husband), not the bar owner (wants cheap labor and worries only about the business after ICE abducts her help), not Dale (wants her as a ""muse"" as Rose puts it). Only the ICE agent who spots Rose provides her any real help (by not taking her in). What a wasted chance to show that humanity has a good side with such important immigration issues, and that these children especially are vulnerable and deserve someone to advocate for them. As we see Rose age and the movie ends, Rose clearly expects that she will also be deported (despite her defiant song).",0
2853,I liked it Vert creepy,1
2854,"A well executed film that turned out to be so very prescient at release as the world came to grips with a global pandemic. A small fishing trawler becomes trapped at sea and the crew find themselves dealing with some kind of unknown deadly infection. Tackling the questions of the individual sacrificing for the greater good, as well as how different people with differing personality traits may interpret the situation around them, the film builds on the already claustrophobic setting of the small ship at sea where young marine-biology student, Siobhán (Hermione Corfield) has been embedded as part of her studies. Siobhán comes across as slightly neurodivergent, and her very analytical approach to the unfolding situation puts her at odds with the very close knit and superstitious crew. The crew in turn expect her as the scientist to have the answers and solutions to what's happening, when in fact she is just trying to work it out herself. Tense and foreboding, with great performances by all, it's a great watch!",1

Die Darsteller geben ein gutes Spiel ab.",1
2859,"The premise can be compared to The Thing/X-Files ""Ice"" episode, but taking place on a fishing trawler.

Unfortunately the main protagonist is wooden and unlikable. The creature doesn't seem to follow any kind of logical life cycle, it just does what it does to make the story happen. Believable dialog and actions by the crew is short and far between. 
The forced ending wants to think they have built the protagonist into someone we should like and care about, her sacrifice throws back to some of the opening dialog but ultimately it's not as smart or well executed as the story presenter wishes. 
Almost every part of the story is a common trope, that should of been better done if they weren't going to explore any new ground. 

It's watchable but a poor way to pass the time.",0
2860,"A low budget affair with a mish-mash of ""Irish"" accents on a trawler off the coast that doesn't really amount to a truly satisfying whole. A decent, in parts, story about a group of people dealing with a virus brought on by contact with an unknown sea species and their attempts to deal with the problem. But it's just not that good in the end (with a couple of questionable character decisions) and it's hampered by its lack of budget, although not as severely as in a lot of other cases.",0
2861,"Unfortunately, Sea Fever borrows some classic tropes from other (better) films of similar genre…resorting it to a forgettable, dull creature feature. The acting was pretty bland and none of the characters seemed particularly likable minus Omis. The creature was a bit of a letdown too…and the way people’s infection spread was pretty corny.

2876,"It's like a mix of Attack the Block and Hot Fuzz, but doesn't have quite the same level of charm associated with either. Get Duked! has a fair bit of dark humor, modern satire, and goofball shenanigans, but has a story that clearly worked backwards to try incorporate a series of self-references and narrative loops without taking the time to smooth out the edges; you can see the heavy influence of Edgar Wright, but not nearly the same polish. At times the humor is either too on-the-nose for its own good, or devolves into ""haha, these guys are chavs"". Still, there's enough charm and humor here to fill out a nice sub-90 minute runtime, nice enough weekday night viewing. 

There is a funny little fight between the late Duke of Edinburgh and a high school kid with a sharp fork, so that's neat. (2.5/5)",0

This documentary exposes the downfalls in an unbalanced focus over the true positives aside from skilled passionate contributive roles than displaying results for justifiable credibility, hence the reasonable portion conclusively explained, but the reflective insights and existing archival footage helped justified the reminiscing exposure in a timely matter, which therefore emphasizes how worthwhile this is in both ways with appreciation.

2884,"This is a fairly amazing documentary all told. It does drag at times. There's the tendency to feel like these are people who are working on something just for themselves and 'their kind', then again, I get that. There's always gonna be tribal factions who are looking out for themselves. At least their efforts with Biosphere 2 were not based on ignorance, paranoia, and class insecurities, or some global conspiracy idiocy. 
The film clips from their time in building up to and including Biosphere 2 are generally fascinating. I'm not surprised at all, though, with the John Allen issues and the project not being continued as such.

I remember the media excitement of at the start of the project, and the later media criticism (typical of the shit attacks, conspiracy theories, and misinformation you find on social media these days).   It was an amazing thing, an incredible accomplishment, marvelous construction and engineering, and didn't deserve the kicking it got.  

The movie  was frankly a bit boring.  I did other work while the thing played in the background.   I didn't watch the ending, since I already knew how it came out.",0

Although it rarely deals with the science behind this experiment, the movie delves deeper into the psychology behind it in that very good second half. The archival footage here is also quite authentic. The problem is that the first half was overly romanticized and laudatory and the direction from Matt Wolf is quite problematic.",1
2889,Great story about incredible people,1
2890,"True.
A group of people really found a lot of energy, and built various different things, from a farm in Mexico, to a boat, a hotel in Karacas? Khatmandu? - and this, an experiment- 8 people , live in a massive complex in Arizona, with representations of each of the Earth's ecosystems, for two years- see whether they cope, or what happens, measure everything. Story told, interviews extant members of group and stops with the end of the experiment.
I didn't like this movie, but I followed it, and feel it has something to teach me. There's also the Raft. Thanks.",1
2891,"The experiment itself I found tremendously captivating, even without all the later affairs that added all the spice to its story and even though there were, to my understanding, nothing scientific about it (""trendy environmental entertainment"", as some called it in the archived footage). But this movie seems, let us say, biased as to what kind of portrayal of the ""Bioshpere 2"" it would like to present to its audience. Suffice it to say that nearly no one outside of John Allen's little inner circle of self-proclaimed geniuses was interviewed here, and certainly no one form the scientific community. It is quite sad that many documentaries that suppose to educate audiences about interesting real-life events and topics make no actual effort to consult with the specialists in related fields (the same can be said about ""The Tiger King""). This is the reason why I cannot realy recommend this to anyone who is not likely to buy Allen's and his friends's weird theatrics and crazy stories about how intelligent and important they were all those years ago.",0
2892,very interesting and I do recommend. it shows the the interesting disconnect between  science and the way media fails to connect to it without sensationalizing it.,1
2893,I've enjoyed the series of these films.  Coogan and Brydon are funny and talented and they play well together.,1
2894,"I've only seen the TV series which I think differs slightly from the films?

I've seen all four series now so you can gauge from that I enjoyed them though I was tiring of the repetitive nature of much of the dialogue.

It was an odd series in its format however. 

Didn't realise till near the end that all the ""real life"" characters, including wives, girlfriends, agents, conquests etc. were actors rather than the real thing!

Did wonder how many film crews had been deployed to capture the phone calls, bedtime scenes etc. and the shots of both Steve and Rob's ""conquests"" climbing out of their bed after one night did look staged to put it mildly!

If you can look past these oddities it's very possible to admire the scenery, the food and the wit on display although their many impersonations can become rather tedious and repetitive at times.

Conclusions - worth a view for some lightweight entertainment. Coogan comes across as a bit of an arse and Rob a much more likeable person…..",0
2895,"Really incredibly boring. I enjoyed the scenery but the story was not very exciting. Some funny jokes but pretty rare. 

Watch for the scenery. Much of the film is in restaurants.",0
2896,"So, here we have the 4th installment of the ""The Trip to…"" universe, which offers just enough chuckles to make it into the recommends, but is definitely not for everyone. My fiancée even asked, ""are you just watching two old guys talk?"" Yeah, kinda, and do impressions. (The two old guys here are Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing fictionalized versions of themselves.) This installment may be the most impression-laden of the bunch, where besides the waiters and chefs giving brief explanations of the food, there is little else about Coogan's actual work. A huge letdown was the dismissive conversation concerning the ending of The Trip to Spain, wherein it is believed Coogan is kidnapped by Islamic Fundamentalists in the Moroccan desert. This could've been a chance for an entertaining flashback or story about how Coogan escaped their clutches — maybe they weren't terrorists or maybe he used his British wit to let their guard down, I don't know, but anything would've been better than just saying, ""Oh, remember that time you were lost in Morocco?"" (para.) Lastly, the shoe-horned storyline about his father's death felt out of place and just a reason to add some drama to a drama-less movie. Just stick with the ""Two witty, ageing men, gallivant across a beautiful European country, holding random discussions and eating delicious food."" The Trip to Greece lands itself in my recommends for the vast majority of the runtime that follows this formula. Unfortunately, the ending didn't feel like the conclusion of Steve and Rob's saga, which naturally sets up The Trip to Germany, The Trip to France, or, God-willing, The Trip to Belarus (despite what the move poster says).",1
2897,"Another trip for Rob and Steve, and the needling and melancholy that has threaded through every outing is, if anything, even more pronounced. Although these are fictionalised versions of themselves there is a strong sense that the truth is only a heartbeat away. The settings and the meals, the everyman philosophising, and of course the wonderful mimicry, are framed with great sensitivity and beauty by Michael Winterbottom, who intuits just when to cut to the next location or day. And his choice of music is spot on.",1
2898,"Meh.  Context: I really liked the original The Trip (i.e. the UK one).  I thought it was pretty original and very funny.  And I liked the Trip to Italy.  But this one...so-so.  I'm thinking it's betting a bit tired.  Could call the series ""Two Pretty Funny Guys Eating At Great Restaurants Al Fresco"".  Guessing 40% of the film is at dinner tables with impressions by Steve and Rob, and another 40% in the car.  Maybe another title: ""Comedians in Cars and Restaurants""?
Maybe it's just me, but many of the impressions (and to be fair they're both pretty damned good at impressions) went right past me.  Pretty sure a UK audience would get it much better than I did.  Steve's cockney Henry VIII, on the other hand, IS hilarious.
But another, more serious thing: it's a kind of oil and water mix, isn't it?  On the one hand we have this fairly surficial yuk-yuk road movie and overlaid is a very, very heavy theme of Steve and his dad, who's fading fast.  I don't think the two meshed at all (probably not supposed to be, but the result is pretty discordant).  And Steve returns prematurely to the UK in a very dark context, while Rob parties it up with his wife? 
I'll give them full marks for an original approach: a mocumentary that is also a dramedy.  Or attempted dramedy, anyway.",0
2899,"THE BICKERSONS

As our travelling pair of pompously verbose sparring partners wind down a curvy road, Steve Coogan tries repeatedly to dislodge Rob Bryden's insistent refrain of ""Grease Is The Word"" to no avail. Bryden defiantly carries on, bludgeoning the show tune with lip-smacking enunciations, to a bitter death. That the insufferable Coogan is at the receiving end makes the sour, sweet. Ah those Brits.

With the fourth (is it the fourth? who knows) instalment of the pair's chit-chatty travelogue series, you'd think the premise would get old. But precisely during these travel averse, barren restaurant, pandemic times, it not only feels fresh and novel, but also romantically nostalgic.

Of course the supposed premise of ingesting lavish scenery, serenading each other with historic tales, and devouring local cuisine is all fine and good, it is the witty back and forth bellicose banter between the two surly thespians one upping each other, that is the heart of these films. The digs are deep, the jabs are pointed. Forget the pen, the tongue is mightier than the sword.

Their self-skewering of the classless upper class is priceless in a faux reality that questions the faux. In true stiff upper lip, chip chip cheerio British bravado, there is a lurking charm and sentimentality beneath the sheen that only a true friendship could foster.

A nice farewell, sardonic as it may be, and a fitting end to the series.

2901,"I like Rob Brydon and I adore Steve Coogan, and I keep watching the trip series because I think they will get better to my taste.  They never did.  I laugh about once a day (trip series takes place over a week), but this is excruciating considering the talent involved.  Final Score: 5.7/10",0
2902,"I imagine that watching the Trip series with enough time between each entry to roughly match the two or three years between each release date would be the optimal viewing conditions, allowing the viewer a sense of general familiarity while keeping them from noticing just how similar they all are. The impressions, the jokes about aging, some contrast between intellectual ruminations and passive disinterest, the 'serious element', and a bit of cultural flavor. Not to say it's a bad combination (in fact, the actors make it really endearing in the first iteration), but doing anything with enough repetition will make it stale sooner or later. (2.5/5)",0
2903,"Anything truly topical regarding the subject matter's narrative pursuit is the most factual while the rest in building up the inspiration with parallels stems from psychological ticking via affecting eccentricity that questions the previous literatures' polish.

Curiosity visits in wonder on what could be within those walls, aside from the satisfied expectation of being an impeccable showcase for cast's performative muster playing convincingly in adding to the bland events. Casually up for the performances brewing up the atmosphere, whatever gets sensed, but narrowly aware of the subject offers contributively questionable insights to the historical contexts. (B)",1
2904,"The grinding claustrophobia and hatred between the characters is the perfect vehicle for Elisabeth Moss, who takes her acting skills from the Handmaid's Tale to a new level.",1
2905,"Many of the works penned by author Shirley Jackson--such as The Lottery and The Haunting of Hill House--are now regarded as literary classics. But as so often happens, at the time and place of their creation they were far from that status. As such, this portrayal of Shirley Jackson is one of a depressed, almost manic (albeit brilliant) creator who chafes against the lack of life/respect given to a creative woman in the 1950s.

For a very basic overview, this film focuses on Shirley (Elisabeth Moss) and husband Stanley Hyman (Michael Stuhlbarg) taking in young couple Rose (Odessa Young) and Fred Nemser (Logan Lermer) as boarders. While Fred works hand-in-hand with Stanley at his university professorship, Rose is left to deal with the odd, often-unhinged Shirley at home, equally beset by bouts of intense creative and madness/depression. When a girl from the university goes missing, Shirley uses that as the impetus for a new novel, along the way uncovering truths about Rose's marriage and upcoming motherhood.

The hallmark of ""Shirley"" is how it constructs its titular character. For most of the film, Jackson is portrayed as a nasty, snarky woman without a nice word to say to anyone. But as certain events unspool and viewers learn more about her existence (such as Stanley's infidelities), we come to sympathize with her plight (at least to a certain extent). It was certainly not easy to be a ""woman creative"" in that time period, and this movie really digs into those themes. This is of course contrasted with Rose's characterization, which starts off as ""perfect wife"" but ends up looking a lot more like Shirley than ever anticipated.

Unfortunately, those great themes are quite scattershot throughout the film. The thread connecting reality to Jackson's new novel actually works against the proceedings by creating confusion as to what exactly is transpiring. While I understood the goal of that choice, it simply didn't work all that well. As such, it takes far too long to really figure out what exactly this picture is all about.

As usual, Moss's performance is excellent. She is truly one of the best actors to grace the big (or small) screen at the moment. Young is also terrific as Rose, who must deal with some pretty heavy revelations of her own.

Overall, I considered ""Shirley"" to be a solid film that delves into a lot of interesting themes about writing, creativity, time periods, and gender. It's a bit too messy to be truly great, but the material, acting, and high production value never render it boring, either.",1

2907,"Elizabeth Moss is a wicked powerhouse in this movie. I loved every minute of her screen time and was left wanting more. Beyond that, however, this film was a slower burn than I think it was marketed to be. The 'psychological tension' aspect certainly delivered upon, I felt ever minute of that. The camera work was superb; I felt myself falling in love! The ending was left completely up to the viewers interpretation and I appreciated that as well. Overall, an interesting film that would benefit from another watch.",0
2908,"Interesting movie about two women, their relationship and creating fiction. Sometimes after watching a movie I find myself reading more information about it online and this was one of those movies. I think there was such vagueness and quite mysterious ending that I needed more information to clarify my thoughts. This was a weird movie too. Relationships between people were quite unusual and unclear. For example it wasn't obvious whether the marriage between the Shirley and her husband is good or bad and do they love each other or not. Also the relationship between Shirley and Rose is open for different interpretations. The whole movie is open for different interpretations. And hence, the vagueness.

Mirabella-Davis is one of those directors who must be followed closely, as he promises a lot.",1

2936,"""The Godfather part 3 , CODA . The death of Michael Corleone."" is the final chapter in cinema's greatest Mob movie franchise. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo move the story into the 1970's with the head of the Corleone family, Michael, trying to become a respectable businessman. By bailing out the Vatican's cash strapped bank while receiving controlling shares in the Vatican's business enterprises Michael hopes to leave his Mobster past behind him. Unfortunately his past won't let go and old connections want a piece of the action. What is really clever in the fictional film is the inclusion of two real events, the murder of the Vatican banker Roberto Calvi and the death of Pope John Paul 1 in 1978.

The film is a good finale to the series well shot and featuring  a beautiful music score  which reprises the Godfather theme and music from the first two films. It is a continuation from previous films events and unlike more recent sequel films doesn't pander to the fans with obvious ""remember when we did this moments"". There are a few flash backs and some imagery from earlier films but it is in context to the story telling and not elbowed in just for fan bait. Despite the questionable love interest between first cousins, the story focusses on Michaels emotional and spiritual journey that finally concludes on the steps of the Opera House in Palermo. A fitting and fulfilling conclusion to The Godfather film series.",1
2937,Very good movie part 1 and 2 are better,1
2938,"I just watched THE GODFATHER CODA: THE DEATH OF MICHAEL CORLEONE, and am profoundly disappointed.
Mind you, I'm one of the few who truly loved GODFATHER III when it was released on Xmas 1990. It's hard to describe just how anticipated the film was back then, and how widely debated it was among critics and fans at the time. The film had some glowing reviews, as well as absolutely damning. But even the film's champions agreed that it was easily the least of the trilogy. 
Then again, what other films within the last 30 years could possibly match the status of either GODFATHER I or II? If pressed, I might suggest SCHINDLER'S LIST or CHILDREN OF MEN…but even those incredible films can't quite compare to the social impact or iconic status Coppola's first two mob epics had. They captivated America. 
In the 30 years since GODFATHER III's release, time has not been kind to the film, as its reputation seems to have diminished exponentially with each passing year. My feelings are that he film has some glaring flaws, but on the whole, I found it to be emotionally powerful, and felt it was a generally worthy ending to the series. It doesn't match the greatness of its predecessors, but it had moments of greatness – and brilliance. Think of it as a shiny gold Cadillac, but with a few unsightly scratches.
And now we have ""CODA"" -- a new cut that apparently satisfied Coppola's post-partum creative tinkerings. Some scenes have been shifted around, while others trimmed or omitted altogether. These might help to move things along at a somewhat faster pace, and arguably give more focus. In one or two instances, the minor trimmings make sense…but all too often the new cuts are awkwardly done. And in one case, devastatingly so. (More on that later.)
Let me come out and say it: ""CODA"" does not improve ""III"", nor does it offer anything new. Those who understandably took issue with Sofia Coppola's acting won't find any alternate takes or redubbed lines that improve her performance. Nor have the film's most awkward and clumsily written scenes been modified. Coppola's edits have, instead, merely reworked a lot of the things that were already there. At best, the changes work and are understandable. At worst, they destroy the movie.
And so come my greatest caveat: the re-edit of the film's ending. (SPOILERS) That Michael Corleone's final moment of death has been excised is not so much a problem, though it's followed by a rather convoluted title card that is completely unnecessary. The unforgivable sin here is the garish cut made to the beautiful montage leading up to the reveal of Michael as an old man. After Mary's death in the original ""III"", we see flashbacks – of Michael dancing with Mary, then with his first wife Apollonia, and then with his second wife Kay – all beautifully intercut to the music beats of the INTERMEZZO. Whereas in ""CODA"", both the montage and music are trimmed, leaving us with a sloppy, abrupt edit that robs the entire ending of its emotional power.
No doubt a number of people will watch ""CODA"", but it will not convert any of the original film's (many) detractors. If anything, ""CODA"" should be viewed as a mere curiosity, or academic supplement, to ""III"". At best, I hope it rekindles interest in the film's previous extended cut, and have people realize that it was, warts and all, a pretty damn good film to start with.",0
2939,"I used to be afraid to watch the third part of The Godfather Trilogy because everyone said that it would ruin the experience of the other two, so it was fortunate to find me a director's cut of the third good valued and after watching it can say that it could not be aspired to a better ending. 9/10",1
2940,"The question I suspect many will ask is does this Coda make Godfather lll better?  I always liked Godfather lll.  In fact I like it better then Godfather ll, blasphemy I know.  To be fair I'm not confused it's a better movie, it's not, I just like it better.  Anyway the Coda.  The two significant changes are the beginning and the ending.  I like both changes.  The beginning tightens things up by skipping the church scene and the Fredo flashback.  Ironically the absence of the  flashback and the new ending do exactly opposite things.  The absent flashback removes emphasis and the new ending adds it.  I like the new more subtler beginning.  Anyone who forgot Fredo just wasn't  paying attention.  I like the new, more stylish ending but I would argue that anyone who thought Michael didn't live a long lonely life before dying alone was also not paying attention.  So does it make Godfather lll better?  I suspect it will make zero difference to anyones overall opinion of the film but it feels a little more in line with the whole sprawling enterprise that is the Godfather saga.  It is the version I will choose to introduce my children too.",1
2941,"This film is exactly what the Godfather III should have been and is more worthy of the first two installments of the franchise.  Coppola removed some of the more unnecessary and out of character scenes from the original Godfather III film and inputted more meaningful scenes that gave the events of the film more context. What a shame the studio forced Coppola to use the Godfather III travesty instead of Coda.  My only complaint remains that Duvall is not in the film, but Coda is a massive improvement of Godfather III.",1
2942,A much better edited version. The story line is easier to follow. Acting is great except for one exception… nepotism. 😁,1
2943,"""Sorry, we missed you"" is a drama that talks about British uberization. Ricky is the main character, Abby's husband, and the father of the two children. They are poor and they have many others' problems. To solve all that problems Ricky bought a truck even if his family was against that idea and he starts to work as a delivery. As a result, the family situation is deteriorating. The scene that marks me was when the child run away and tag the painting in the stairs. In my opinion this is a good movie, because even if that a drama we can see the love of a father who does everything he can to help them financially at the expense of his family.",1
2944,"Ken Loach stage a dramatic film with social subjects once again. This film is about a subject that many English people face and that no one talks about. ""Sorry we missed you"" speaks to us about the evil of today, especially urbanisation and the precariousness of work.  In this film the main characters are Ricky and Abby, two parents whose situation is unstable, every unexpected event is a mountain to them. It's an ordinary family trying to exist in a inefficient social system. This movie is a strong and powerful social message, it's a clear moral, we must act.  In our opinion, it's an indispensable movie because thousand of people are in the same situation. In fact, it's a realistic scenario. Of course go and watch this movie!!!!",1
2945,"""Sorry we missed you"" is a dramatic comedy. Adapted form the book ""sorry we missed you"" by Suzy Krause. It is an emotional and striking movie. The movie denouces the excesses of uberization and the ravages they can have on the life of a family. We discover it through the Turner's family. The main characters are the members of the family, Ricky the father,his wife Abbie and their children Jane and Seb. This is a precarious family of Newcastle. Ricky has just lost his job and begin a new career as a parcel deliver. He is self-employed which gives him no social protection, he his paid at the stain so he has to work a lot, 14 hours per day and 6 days on 7. The all family is suffering of his time-consuming. The movie takes place in our time to show that these are current problems. In my opinion, this is an interesting movie because it show a current problem through the emotional acting of the actors. But on an other side, it is also a boring movie for me, the scene are verry long because we are in the daily life of a family. If you want to discover this problems that touches some family lets watch ""sorry we missed you"".",0
2946,"This movie is a tragedy, it's an emotional and striking movie. It talks about Ricki's family his wife Deby and theirs childrens, Abby and Sebastian. They didn't have any propertys exept Debbi's car. They wanted to have a better situation so ricki get a new job. He became an independant and work for his own. Their life became more difficult. The scene take place in a town, in their house and in a truck. In my opinion this movie was insteresting because the main characters are complex and sensitive. There is a critic of the independants work condition and a systeme that exhaust workers. We can see Ricki in trouble during all the movie .But it was also borring. There's no a lot of actions and it's a long movie.",0
2947,"Sorry we missed you is a dramatic movie. The mains characters are the Turner family who go through social issues. The parents represent the heroes of the movie and embody quotidian life heroes in the society. The kids, go through too because of their parent's economic situation and their disagreement especially the son. The responsible for all this problem is uberisation. Indeed, the father changed his job for delivery, and this difficult job brings tensions. A striking scene is when the son was really angry, and hit his father. It was really chocking. In my opinion this movie talks about an important subject and it's really emotional, however I am not into this kind of realistic movie, and I found it a little bit boring without really actions.",0
2948,"This dramatic film directed by Ken Loach tells the story of Nick and Abby Turner, two parents who have to work hard to provide for their family. 
Nick starts his new job as a package delivery man. Abby, has to go to her patients by bus because they sold her car, to buy Nick's truck. Meanwhile, Sebastian, their son has behavioral problems, and Liza Jane, their daughter has to live in this stressing environnement. This movie spares no character from the hard reality. 
Personnaly, I found this movie touching because characters are all endearing. The dad wants the happiness of his family, even if sometimes does it badly. The mother, even tough she has to care of eldery people all day long, she is always attentive to the rest of the family. 
If you like dramatic story, with social realities, I recommend you this film.",0
2949,"""Sorry we missed you is a (dramatic) comedy film made by Ken Loach and Paul Laverty in 2019. This film talks about the ""uberization"" problem in the society.

At the beginning everything was fine but quickly the reality of this job shows his real face and life was very hard for the family and make a lot of repercussion. I like the movie because it gives me a lot of emotion like empathy but this kind of film is always for me a little bit boring.",1
2950,""" Sorry we missed you"" is a drama movie. It is a good exemple of social realism. 
It talks about a family who leaves in New-Castle in England, the main characters are Ricki's family with his wife Debby, his son Sebastian and his daughter Liza.  
After the financial crisis that has impacted many families like the one of Ricky who lost his job, he had to found another job, as a delivery person for PDF industry. His wife works as a home care nurse, they have money problems and also problems with their son who doesn't go to school and makes gratify on the walls.   

In my opinion this movie could be interesting but, the plot is too long and repetitive, so it's a boring movie even though the subject it's important and can touch everyone.",0
2951,"Entertaining enough.  The oppressive day-to-day challenges presented in the story are  definitely not 'entertaining', but the story is told quite well.  Decent production quality.  I did find the heavily accented dialogue a bit challenging to follow, but I stuck with it.  The end of the story was interestingly not really an ending and left me shaking my head a bit.",1
2952,"This is another hard hitting Ken Loach British social commentary type drama. It goes without saying its quite sobering and doesn't hide away from the many flaws of the system its focussing on (the so called 'gig economy'). The characters are pretty well developed and I liked seeing how the husband and wife struggle in their own jobs, their own circumstances, mostly quite isolated in their own ways, trying to work around the situations they find themselves in. It'd be hard not to feel sorry for the family depicted, to one extent or another, certainly. Its reasonably thought provoking, although of course its hardly a cheery film but neither should it be. This is worth a watch if it sounds of interest, so I'd recommend it, yes.",1
2953,"This is a somewhat mysterious film - not really what I'd call a horror film, although it is unsettling at times and there are the ocassional moment that may make you want to look away from the screen but its by no means a constant jumpscare type film throughout. Its got quite a plodding feel to it for the most part, indeed the music played in the background is what you might hear on an old fashioned PI type show. It has a claustrophobic feel to it as well. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it - its bizarre but not unwatchable, with an intriguing main character. I'd recommend this if it sounds of interest, for the 'curiosity factor' alone although perhaps not to the extremely squeamish and I suppose the plot isn't 100% original but otherwise its an intriguing enough watch, yes.",1
2954,fun lil French flick,1
2955,"This absurd and understated dark comedy featured a totally unique concept that worked best due to the quirkiness baked into the portrayal of the protagonist from Jean Dujardin. I was totally into the narrative overall but this somehow still dragged a bit at times, which is slightly alarming given the 77 minute runtime. 6.5/10",0
2956,"Probably one of the weirdest films you are ever likely to watch, must have cost about three euros to make. I would take some of the critical views with a pinch of salt. I certainly would not want to read too much into it other than law enforcement seems remarkably lax in some parts of France. The only other thing we learn is that these days it's remarkably easy to make a movie and no special skills are needed. But we all know that anyway. Yes it's a comedy, yes it's a bit of slasher flick. File under oddball. My only criticism is l would have had Eric Cantona playing the lead.",1
2957,I just do not see the point.,0
2958,The movie is too absurd for words.  A man is obsessed with a fridged jacket that is 2 sizes too small. It is just stupid. Don't waste your time.,0
2959,"Unsurprisingly, Cineworld weren't showing Quentin Dupieux's new film about a man who becomes obsessed with his newly purchased deerskin jacket, to the point that he commits murder(s) in a bid to become the only person on the planet to own a jacket. I managed to see this at my favourite cinema, Chichester Cinema at New Park, and it was quite an experience. Dupieux is no stranger to the absurd, he is possibly best known for Rubber (2010) a film about a killer tyre. Deerskin is a different beast however; although very darkly comedic, the way in which the film is played completely straight faced is somewhat unnerving, to the point that when I laughed, I was worried that Jean Dujardin (brilliantly playing lead character Georges) was looking directly at me. Deerskin is only seventy seven minutes long, but it uses every second of it to produced a constant sense of unease, despite the film being highly amusing. Dujardin is excellently assisted by Adele Haenel, who he cons into giving him money to complete his 'film.' There are shades of Peter Strickland's In Fabric (2018) not just because of the potential murderous items of clothing, but because the two films are so tonally similar in terms of dark humour. On a personal level, somewhat bizarrely, the tassels of Georges' jacket reminded me very much of the leather tassels hanging from a leather bag on the front cover of Prurient's 2015 album Frozen Niagara Falls. The reason this resonated (apart from the fact I've recently been listening to a lot of Prurient) was because of the difficult nature of Prurient's work. It's very hard to classify, it can be difficult to understand, but it makes the music no less striking and impressive. Just like Prurient's output, Dupieux has created something highly original and hard to classify, and it makes for essential viewing.",1
2960,"An exceptionally deadpan black comedy with a flavouring of Nightcrawler. Unfortunately, the wonderfully weird premise of the film never truly gets into a full swing and the very short runtime leaves you feeling slightly unsatisfied. Jean Dujardin and Adèle Haenel (who I will be checking out more of) both put in great performances and certainly helped the film through. I'm still not quite sure I understood what the point or message that being conveyed here was, and that likely detracted from my enjoyment and appreciation.",0
2961,A most enjoyable funny dark comedy from director Quentin Dupieux. Jean Dujardin is simply a pleasure to watch in this superb surreal arthouse film. Available now on HBOmax.,1

2965,"Revealing and as poignant today as it was in 1980. Great film-making, it will be useful for many as perspective for how American politics and international relations took a sharp turn.",1
2966,"This is a fairly subtle film, which I found (I feel bad for saying this) somewhat dull in parts. I tend to like a good family drama but this film felt a little bit long drawn out and while some secrets told were interesting, it didn't grab my attention for long really, although I suppose it is somewhat thought provoking. The cast do give good performances and I like some of the camerawork. I thought it was ironic seeing the scenes where the mum is acting on set, with actors playing her family, knowing her real relatives were nearby and wondering things. Overall I'd say this is an ok film but not one I'd actively recommend, no.",0
2967,"The Truth is a very fine film. There's an interesting story line with a clever take on acting and family relationships. 
Deneuve and Binoche are fantastic as mother and daughter. It's such a great pleasure to see two such masters on the screen together. They raise this from a rather average movie to something great; something imbued with the realism and subtle intensity of family dynamics.
Fabienne believes her press a bit too much. Then again, it's a much nicer version of the actual 'truth', isn't it? This is the version she wrote of in her memoirs. It's the one that sees her as the ever-devoted artist who puts her craft first, but not to the point of showing the absent mother and wife she was. That's the Fabi we take in while viewing 'The Truth'.
Binoche plays the mature. confident daughter Lumir who was maybe too strong and confident for her mother.
Also giving strong performances are Ludivine Sagnier, Manon Clavel, and the wonderful Clémentine Grenier as Lumir's daugher Charlotte.
It's fitting that Hawke plays as rather hack-y tv actor. Aside from 'First Reformed', I haven't seen him give performances or show a range that great film stars give, though his work in 'Maudie' is credible as well.
Nice job by director/writer Kore-eda.  3.4 stars",1
2968,"The film that, finally, made me connect one hundred with the cinema of the Japanese Koreeda, The truth remains a deep, beautiful and conciliatory meditation on motherhood, family and the traumas of the past. Its cast could not be better, with performances so natural that it could well be the recording of a family reunion in which the complexity of the protagonists is finally revealed and forgiveness arrives.",1
2969,Excellent casting. The duos between Denueve and Binoche are something to admire.,1
2970,Undemanding family drama is amusing for having Ethan Hawke play the helpless bystander to a feud between the titans Deneuve and Binoche.,0
2971,A great example where a good story is elevated by the level of acting and Deneuve is inspired to higher heights as a result; bravo to casting Binoche to raise the stakes,1
2972,"Had no idea almost all of the movie was in French: expected some but come on, it has Ethan Hawks in it! Disappointed",0

The creature flick that this movie has gave vibes of 'Life' while the atmosphere and ending reminded me of the 'Blackcoats daughter'. But the interesting analysis of the alien monster and its uniqueness as a symbiote is what gives this movie a depth and seperates it from other movies of this genre. The praise certainly goes to the editors of this movies to give it a perfect running time. Has it been a little longer it could have been boring. The movie is based in Russia which provides an excellent cold and isolated kind of atmosphere along with the communist regimes which gives the viewers a feeling of strandedness that the characters in this movie face.

The actors did an excellent job and their interactions with one another were very solid and fluid. You could tell they had a lot of fun with this on set. Overall I highly recommend seeing it!

One thing I am noticing is people who are upset with the ending. Not to get into it to much so I don't spoil it, but when watching the ending think about what YOU believe to be true and then question it. It makes you really think if you go about it that way.",1

I've seen SY! 3 times already and each time I laugh even harder and pick up on subtle hints and nuances that give me a deeper understanding of the film and make me appreciate it even more. So, whether you are just looking for an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon or are ready to delve into the more important questions, SY! should be at the top of your ""must watch"" list!",1
3022,"This film is just what 2020 ordered. Not only is it very much-needed comic relief from an absolutely horrifying reality, but the film touches on our humanity in a way that has never been more relevant. We all know that existential tug to put our phones down and unplug from everything for a while. But what happens when that toxic piece of technology is the one thing that could save you from an apocalypse? We've gotten comfortable as a society with food delivery, entertainment on demand, and everything we could possible want at our finger tips. But what happens when we need to depend on our skills to survive? Are you prepared to save yourselves? 

This film is quick witted, funny as hell, and really gets you thinking about the ways in which the human race handles a crisis. As for whether, ultimately, technology is crucial or a crutch... I'll leave that up to you to decide at the end of this film.",1

3030,"Spoilers: Impressive work by Hannah/April, another of these impressive young actors who are so creative they also do the writing and executive producing. She looks a little like Sandra Bullock and has her kind of wit. This is at once a passages piece, from high school to college, and the disruption it wreaks on relationships, but also a kind of cliffhanger, as in: Who's going to end up with whom? It was interesting Clara made it clear she didn't love Nick but did love April. It did well the anything-goes kind of zeitgeist of at least some of the youths today -- boy/girl, girl/girl, lots of shots and weed. And the ever-present coming of age in these teen movies: Who am I, what do I want to do, etc.? A lot of these kids are upscale, very smart, college-bound, funny, witty and the banter reflects mind-sets of entitlement to do what you want. Only one parent was in it, like a Peanuts cartoon that has no parents, and the always competent Jessica Hecht showed the uneasy pressure of raising two smart-mouth girls alone. Seems both the boys loved April, she loved longhair Nick and Clara, and it was a let's-find-out mind-set as they moved off into college in different directions. We'll have to be content with how we feel now for now.  Real nice effort to express what's going on out there in the Gen Z  set, and a pretty honest story, if not that satisfying, as we see no one settling on whom they are with. Heck, they don't know.",1
3031,"This movie has a major problem with queer baiting. The whole trailer and 90% of the movie, I was convinced the two main girls were falling in love. They set up many signs pointing to their romance. In the end, they are just friends and I feel extremely misled. I was really enjoying the film, and don't get me wrong, I really like girl friendships being displayed, but they had gay joke after gay joke, sleeping in bed together holding hands, people saying what a great couple they are, etc. scenes that completely convinced me that this was a romance waiting to bloom (and it would've been a great one at that). Then, last scene was a ""I love you but not in that way"" scene. Completely threw me off and ruined the whole movie! I have never felt actually queer baited before, but this was such a blow to the LGBTQIA+ community: giving us what would have been awesome representation and a romantic build up, just to tear it away and claim they are just friends. News flash, best friends don't hold hands or stroke each others' arms or talk about making out like the girls did in the film. This was ridiculous.",0

Its problems mostly lie in its abject laziness in story telling and character development, but it honestly doesn't make the movie that much less enjoyable if you don't mind suspending your disbelief for a good 75 minutes or so. There are fleeting moments when these characters act like actual teenagers, but they're so few and far between that they too often feel like written characters and not real ones.",0

It follows a pretty contemporary story with a few twists and turns throughout that really keeps this one fresh. April and Nick started as friends and quickly it buds into a beautiful mixture of friendship and romance that seems to fizzle out after 2 years. Unbeknownst to Nick his new girlfriend Clara, becomes best of friends with his now ex April. At first it appears that April's intention is to get some sort of retribution over Nick but soon she realizes that she truly loves Clara as a person and they form a genuine bond. That's when they unintentionally get Nick's best friend Ben involved in the secret and then this is when things become extremely tricky. Friendships and relationships will be tested to the extreme, can reconciliation stand tall through adversity?",1
3038,"While Robin Williams' previous documentary chronicles his life with expected emotional punch between laughter and sadness, this one titularly details his unspoken wish caught on and motivated by his widow from his declining days till his unfortunate turn of event. A complete 180 across multiple points between the two documentaries that reverses the emotionally balanced impacts, turning this respectfully, saddeningly blunt, well-focused framework of an untold story that realistically, as needed, completed one's true profile to more humane than just a gifted comic via cherished memories. The insightful, eye-opening effect proves to be haunting, and capable to haunt a viewer lingeringly in one point or another while gladly essentially spread informally. (A-)",1
3039,"This is understandably a sad and sobering watch but I felt it was well made - informative, respectful and it features numerous clips of Robin's comic routines and clips of him in films. It features people who knew him well, including his widow, speaking about their memories of him. It also features healthcare professionals talking about lewy body dementia, which is what Robin had (without knowing at the time). It's an insightful documentary film which I would recommend, yes.",1
3040,"A penetrating, confidential image of the last days in the life of a very famous actor and comedian Robin Williams, who tragically ended his life - without fully knowing what caused the deteriorating state of his brain's functioning - in the face of a gradual loss of control over subsequent life functions that prevented him from efficiently fulfilling his professional duties and ordinary everyday.
Plus, the popular comedian's image of a popular comedian as depressed celebrity after numerous episodes involving stimulants, including alleged financial problems plaguing him, caused by hasty media reactions.
Separately, the extraordinary efforts of his wife Susan Schneider Williams in making the world aware that the cause of her husband's death was due to the dementia of Levy's bodies (LBD, discovered in Robin only after his death) - an incurable and fatally devastating disease, without a diagnosis causing increased fear, paranoid and confused and had a tremendous impact on Williams' mental and physical health, which ultimately led to the tragic descent of the actor admired by millions of followers around the world.
Unfortunately, the film reveals symptoms of an excessive fascination with Robin's acting skills, with particular emphasis on his comedic talents, which makes him an apological product that is difficult for the observer to fully accept.",0
3041,This was such an eye opening intimate look into what Robin Williams was dealing with mentally. I think it helps fill in the blanks where some of us might have missed crucial information about his disease. Quality interviews and information from people close to Robin was the best part.,1
3042,"Awesome! Robin's Wish covered every bit of Robin's end of life years... which have not been reflected in any of the earlier documentaries on Robin's life. Tylor Norwood is a brilliant cinematographer, director and Robin's Wish speaks to his brilliance in the details...the storyline, the doctors' views on the syndrome, the music which synced with the story said it all.",1
3043,"Very powerful documentary about Robin Williams' suicide in August 2014, the diagnosis post-mortem of Lewy's Body Dementia and how it robbed him of everything he lived for. Especially moving is his widow Susan's eloquence and the love he engendered in so many of his friends, neighbours and complete strangers. Lots of clips of him on and off-screen, and of real interest to anyone with even a passing interest in the brain and its fragility.",1
3044,The widow of Robin Williams is hoping to set the record straight  about the death of her husband.  Williams suffered from diffuse Lewy body disease which impacted his acting career and contributed to his death by suicide.  I had never heard of it.  The film explains what Williams went through late in his life via the words of those closest to him.  There are some really cool behind the scenes stories and the ending broke me in half.  Final Score: 7/10,1
3045,"Robin Williams fue un genio sin duda alguna, una persona admirable, explosiva y enferma, sufrió de demencia con cuerpos de Lewy,  el segundo tipo más común de demencia progresiva después de la demencia por enfermedad de Alzheimer. El documental va sobre los últimos días de Williams, los comentarios de sus amigos cercanos, sus vecinos y su viuda, así como de la explicación científica de la enfermedad y los dolorosos síntomas que tuvo que enfrentar al final de sus días. Interesante, pero un tanto plano y aburrido, las declaraciones de la viuda dan la sensación de ser falsas, actuadas.",1
3046,"Yeah, a bunch of Williams friends and work mates doing the usual American over exaggeration of his alleged brilliance. Better to ask an international audience whether they think he was a great comedian. not a group of his mates trying to create a legacy. It comes across as all things American i.e.l fake.",0

The sound track is excellent as well, by Sean Price of Pricetone Studios.",1
3048,"The acting by Jim Cumming is the worst acting I have seen in years. Some body needs to inform him that irrational raving is not acting. It's a complex nuance of emotions, non verbal gestures and facial expressions. Robert Forster and Riki Lindhome were the saving grace for this film. Without them it wouldn't have even rated. Cumming could have learnt from these actors. I wondered for the first half hour if this was classified and was actually a comedy. This flick tries emulate several genres but falls very short of Fargo. It's reminiscent of a new method of filmmaking where well known actors are used in limited casting time to create a cheaper platform for lesser known ""poorer"" actors. Due to this it fails on many levels as others have failed before it. Nothing original here. Hollywood Washing… Great actingnby Riki.",0
3049,"The directorial style is poor and amateur. A sense of completely unfounded grandiosity and achievement pervades the titles before and after the film. The writing is patched together and awkward. Is this an attempt at comedy? The acting is usually third-rate with an occasional moment of passable. The only way this film could have gotten such high rotten tomatoes scores is that all the of the crowdfunders and everyone they knew were instructed to give it a high rating, no matter what their actual honest opinion may be. A real disgrace and theft of rental fees.",0
3050,"I can't believe it's rating is this high. People must think it's quirky when it's just bad. Actors looking straight into the camera isn't quirky, it's disconcerting. Characters overreacting and acting unnatural isn't quirky it's bad directing. I could see if it was funny and tongue in cheek but it's not.",0

This movie as well as the other films of director Paul Verhoeven are broken down by its similarities and themes throughout his films. Great footage shown throughout.   Very interesting take on a quite fun film.",1
3059,"This documentary about the re-evaluation of 1995 Showgirls has interesting interviews, but its choice of being mainly voice-overs on Paul Verhoeven's other films excerpts spiced up with incrustations of Showgirls is questionable.",0
3060,"This deep dive into the enduring cultural impact of Showgirls is a must-watch for diehard fans of the movie and even -- thanks to director Jeffrey Mchale's clever editing and the thought-provoking insights of his contributors, those who have (somehow) never seen it. They'll definitely want to after You Don't Nomi!",1
3061,"Exceptional.  This documentary not only breathed new life into my own fascination with Showgirls, but also into the documentary genre itself.   McHale's techniques were creative and thought-provoking.  His final product stands strong against all previous irreverent critique about this masterpiece (of sh*t) and refuels my love for each and every second of Showgirls. Bravo.",1
3062,"It was trash. It was art. It was a film you either loved or hated or didn't see at all because you had an older sibling who would rent you X-rated movies. It was Showgirls, and now it's You Don't Nomi. A truly inspired title and a very enjoyable documentary to go along with it, YDN has both the ardent fans and the scornful detractors coming together to make sense of a cult following that's been building for over 25 years. I remember seeing Showgirls a few years ago, and being a stunned at how ridiculous everything was, and had no desire to revisit it at any time in the future. But some people have, frequently in some cases, and now the question of whether it was a misunderstood masterpiece or a garish pantomime rife with racism, misogyny and a complete contempt for humanity is once again up for debate. Both sides make compelling arguments, and more than anything else the films exposes just how subjective a film can be. 2 people can see the exact same movie at the exact same time and have completely different opinions. Neither are right and neither are wrong, the only questions you can ask is, ‘did you enjoy it?' Some people love Showgirls for its critique of Las Vegas, how its razzle dazzle is merely a smokescreen for abuse and subjugation, and some despise it for sensationalising these same themes for cheap thrills and profit. Some of the commentary provided is in-depth to the point of incomprehension, and both the praise and ridicule can be absurd at times. But overall, it displays a true passion for a film people wrote off in its day as nothing more than cheap exploitation and expected it to die a quick yet extremely loud death. If you're in any way interested in Showgirls or the hype that had built up around it in the years since its debut, You Don't Nomi is the very thing you've been waiting for.",1
3063,"This essay or ode to Showgirls as well as Paul Verhoeven's films was super interesting to watch if you like to listen to breakdown of movies, art or films. I felt like I was not alone in thinking this film is more than what people give credit for. I never felt it was the WORST film ever made. Was it over the top? Was there silly dialogue? Trust me, this Ode to Showgirls will show you more to Showgirls than you've seen previously and also explain the phenomenon of Showgirls as a cult film. You no longer have to hide and you can now show you are actually a closeted fan of the film, Showgirls. This film will echo your thoughts of the film and more.",1

If you're into criminally boring stories about a group of randoms who finally saw the film 4 years after its release and have hung onto whatever pubic hairs Nomi Malone has left, then this is the film for you. Absolutely ineffective.",0

3067,"After quite a lot of buildup this film turned out to be a real disappointment. The film chooses to do no on-camera interviews with the people who are featured, instead using just the audio of their interviews over either static images or footage. It relies really heavily on footage from other films that are related only by being mentioned, or because they were directed by Paul Verhoeven. I didn't want to watch this movie so I could see roughly 20 minutes, cumulitively, of Basic Instinct, Robocop etc...

What's also disappointing is the lack of inclusion of input by people actually invovled with the film, instead relying on the input of critics and academics. Though this is interesting, it can often be quite dry, and doesn't really sustain a nearly two hour long documentary; especially when many of them repeat the same observations and opinions.

Fans of Showgirls, like myself, will no doubt enjoy it for what it is, but if they're looking for insight or exciting stories from people actually involved in making the film, or any kind of new tidbits of trivia or behind the scenes info, they will be left wanting.",0

3069,Aron Sorkin returns for his best work since the Social Network. Also the closest true sorkin fans will get to the West Wing post season 4,1
3070,"In the competition for the Oscars in 2021, among the films that could all together be described in the mildest and most benevolent way simply as a god-da*n boring, an interesting achievement by screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin stands out, about the event that was initially known as the trial of eight, but after the dismissal of charges against Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale, became the trial of seven protest organizers in Chicago in 1968.

Aside from all the disagreements with historical facts, simplification, polishing and the usual falsification of elements of the story, ostensibly for artistic freedom and greater dramatic effects, the film managed to convey the spirit and mood of American citizens towards the establishment from the described period, remaining dynamic and interesting for watching to the end, something in which e.g. failed a film that is describing the same time period, ""Judas and Black Messiah"".

For great casting and flawless acting, I have no comments. Unfortunately, there was enough time in the movie for irritating individual lines and retellings of jokes that do not belong to the plot or events that are described, and which are the so-called ""seal"" of the director. Some characters were invented without any real reason, such as a girl who plays an inserted FBI agent and then witnesses in the court, even though the first female agent in the FBI was employed only a decade later.

Is it a big movie? Sadly, no. Is it better than the other candidates for the Academy Award? Yes, for a length of two spears. Only, as someone has already noticed, the film did not bring us as close to the events of 5 decades ago as modern events and democracy have returned to the past for so much. When not well learned, history tends to repeat itself. For local occasions, we in Serbia now already know that very well.",1
3071,"1ya- Sharply written and well edited, the film vibrates in it's star packed court room scenes.",1
3072,Brilliant story-telling. Brilliant acting. And brilliant script!!,1
3073,"Writer-director Aaron Sorkin at his definite best, peaked impeccably, when not only being a storyteller exposing echoing truths through true colors that radiates relevantly today but mainly a transporter solidly delivering a time capsule. You're not only watching the trial like a compelled filmgoer, but you also become helpless when capably enveloped in the depicted time period whereas greedy corruption and injustice takes over by being pathetically powerful and politically uncaring by disposability. This is the other half of a shared discussion towards the politically problematic Vietnam war with Spike Lee's ""Da 5 Bloods"", both forming a perfect double feature under connected rebelliously stirring commentary, whereas critical exposures come to light and connections finally unveiled. Provocative resonance is the main way to describe the experience as tensions rises amid conflicting morals regarding peaceful revolutionary precepted methods argued when prosecution and police brutality asked for violent opposites, particularly conservative bias running unfairly under supposed repeatedly stated ""impartial"".

When we identify with the defendants stressfully at the edge of our seats, it's emotionally thrilling than most courtroom dramas being merely observants with not much provocative rising rather just hopeful engagement by intellectual fascination. (If not, then there's a true color within negatively aligned with abused power). Entirely strengthened by Sorkin's balanced thoroughness of factual deliverance while the brilliant cast performed at their best under energetically gripping perfection that builds up a convincingly immersive atmosphere with interpretive expressions that respectfully adds onto the facts. Overwhelming injustice of spineless unresolve takes up most of the aura, which affected the rating as it deserves higher, but undeniably graded based off on the overall thunderous spirit infecting our inner rebellious sides between the sharpness and exceptionality across all praiseworthy merits.

The transitions between scenes seemed jumpy and I would find myself losing interest. The last scene where Chloe visits her mom seemed really out of place. Chloe is written to be this sweet girl that we sympathize with, but the ending makes her into something entirely different. It almost turned the movie into an underdog story.

I had no idea what this was about going in which is the best way to go. Plaza does an excellent job in this film.  Starts off as kind of an uncomfortably awkward comedy and turns into something very different and unexpected.  Really enjoyed this one.",1
3113,"This was a pathetically embarrasing and way too proud-of-itself effort from a director obviously hostile to his audience and thumbing his nose at them saying:  

""eff you.  You'll never be able to follow any of this because I'm a genius and you're too simple minded to get it""

I am personally sick of the arrogant hubris of directors who want to flaunt their superiority at the audience instead of communicating to them.

And as far as the so-called amazing acting on the part of the female lead, all I can think of is those marvelously skilled  (and truly superior) British actresses who don't need to resort to fall-on-the-floor, howling histrionics to get their point across. 

What this female lead pulled off here had nothing to do with acting and everything to do with highly annoying toddler-style temper tantrums which any attention seeking neurotic could achieve whether or not they'd been to acting school.  And yet, this naive film crew was so proud of these wanton hysterical fits that they made them the centerpiece of the entire movie.

Please - let those in need of therapy obtain some and leave the acting to those with some style and panache.",0
3114,"This movie was more of a psychological thriller-ish, in the sense that it really makes you wonder what actually happened. I loved the lead performance by Aubrey Plaza, just superb. Great acting, layered writing and keeping the viewer in the dark almost always.",1
3115,"Plaza is a powerful actress with untried range.  This film, however, is little more than the director/writer's solopsism.  Not made for an audience.  Critics will predictably try to outdo one another in over-analyzing it.  I suspect that's the point: the joke's on them.",0
3116,"One Cut of the Dead based in the relationship between a director husband and his actor wife (maybe?). It ends in ambiguity, but - oh my! - the ride to get there is full of emotion and sex - and a phenomenal acting performance from Plaza!",1
3117,"Unbearable indie dribble that sinks quickly after its striking opening shot.

Black Bear is bloated and self-indulgent.   It takes its place among the absolute worst of Amazon's ""sure we'll buy it"" to give an illusion of endless content catalogue.  

Plaza's lauded performance is one to endure, not enjoy.   It reminds me of a Celine Dion performance -- concentrating so much on what she can do with her voice that the music itself is mind-numbingly monotonous.

Black Bear's dialogue is stilted, unnatural and worse, uninteresting.  

Apparently, part two is some type of insider self-parody that bookends this ""see: Plaza-can-play-dramatic-parts"" vehicle.     

If you like a David Lynch-style throw-shit-against-the-wall and act like it has a deeper meaning drama, you might find yourself with the critics.   Otherwise, save yourself the buck forty-five run time and literally do anything else.",0

3125,Saw The Climb in theaters last night. Boy was it great to be in a theater again!!! Super pumped to see this film. Heard about it winning at Cannes but didn't get to see it there. Glad I finally saw it. Great drama with smart comedy throughout. What a feat filming this flick in those long one takes and I was impressed with that underwater scene. Great job for first time director. I didn't know too many of the actors but they all did a good job. That Gayle Rankin is amazing. Loved the ending.,1
3126,Feels like a film from another era but also strangely relevant today. I have a feeling this is one of those movies that’ll just gain a cult following over time. I read the reviews before but still had no idea what to expect. Happy I got to see it in theaters.,1
3127,I enjoyed this. That’s it,1

3131,"The right wing haters have been very busy giving this one bad reviews.
Ignore them. It's worth seeing. It's not perfect, but it's fun, sometimes funny and touching, sometimes a bit over the top.
The 2 lead characters are both flawed and likable. Their relationship is shown evolving, though some of the plot turns are pretty predictable. 
It's essentially 2 high school seniors on a road trip. There are adventures, some of which are pretty cool. The scene with the christian fanatics is, to me, overdone, as is the ensuing chase scene. My sense is the writer & director just wanted some fast action there, which will appeal to some. It has a really good Indie soundtrack and some cool scenery.
The pro-choice message is militant and unfiltered. There's also a pro-Gay message, which would have enraged the bigots further, and pretty much all the people who help these 2 girls out are Black. No wonder the haters pulled out all the stops to trash this film! I think the message could have been communicated more subtly, but I fully support it. 
Ultimately, to me, this is a story about people taking care of each other. On the whole, despite some flaws, that makes it a worthwhile and positive experience.",1

3138,"I love books & I read a lot, so I found this documentary fascinating.",1
3139,"I found some of the characters featured to be fascinating and I also found that the movie had some great nuggets about why books are so important.   However, I also thought the movie jumped around a lot and tried to contain too many people and too many small vignettes from all the people they talked too. It was like the people making the film did not want to play favorites or hurt anyone's feelings.  Because of this, I felt like the movie never got as deep or made a strong as an impression as it could have.  I think it might have been smarter to focus on four or five of the booksellers and follow their stories more closely. How they started, what they actually do in the course of the day, how it impacts their life and then the future of their craft. They touched on at the end how some of the booksellers did not see a future in their profession beyond themselves.  There was a younger woman on the end who worked in the field and said  she had many ideas and was very optimistic. I wanted to hear her thoughts but then it just jumped to the next person. The movie gave extra time to selling a famous book of Leonardo Da Vinci's  notes to Bill Gates at an  auction to a man showing a bunch of drawings of fish in a book. All in all, I still enjoyed the documentary but it left me feeling like there was more of a story still left about people who find and sell rare and old books.",1
3140,What a fascinating documentary about book sellers. It's very interesting how book sellers and expensive book buyers are. I highly recommend this for your average collector of anything. Every collector has the same mindset and it shows in this movie. Yes it only talks about book collectors but we collectors are all the same. Great documentary.,1

Colorful personalities make up for the meandering storybits and underwhelming music.",1
3143,"When a rare younger book dealer enthusiastically says she is full of ideas and hope for the future of the trade, there is no follow up whatsoever and the begrudging documentary turns back to its theme of the slow, gasping, grasping death of independent rare book sellers.  They bemoan the loss of mystique to Amazon and other book-selling sites that remove the need for a quest and remove the ability of individual booksellers to randomly set prices for ""rare"" books that the internet now allows people to learn true price and true rarity for themselves.  Darwin's law of evolution is not really survival of the fittest, but survival of those who adapt.  The old guard is not adapting and so they are dying. The dilemma is: have they closed ranks to women, minorites and young dealers for so long that they've laid the groundwork for their own obsolesense?  Great peak into some interesting amassing of books by hoarders/collectors. (The difference being how organized you are?)  And there are some glimmers of hope that the film doesn't really explore but does touch on.  Like -- 'everyone I see reading books on the subway are in their 20s.'  And no more information on that possible trend is looked into.  (That people are using digital books is bemoaned, but does not acknowledge that publishers have spelled their own doom by printing smaller and tighter text to save paper whilst alientaing the over-40 reader... which are the very folks most likely to use an e-reader (Kindle, et al) which allows them to enlarge the font.  Worth seeing, but leaves one feeling there was little overview and little exploration of what's emerging.",1
3144,"The Booksellers is about you're not going to believe this... people who sell books. It also chronicles people who buy them and, in fact, the doc covers every nook and cranny of the industry for the layman.  If you're into this kinda thing you're gonna love this and if you're not it's still a well-made tale that does tend to drag if you're not entirely interested in the subject because some of the talking heads despite having great passion for the subject, just aren't that interesting.  If there's something missing here about the topic I didn't catch it!  Final Score: 6.7/10",1

3147,"Bibliomaniacs unite! Fans of Basbanes' 'A Gentle Madness' will revel in this dissection of the rare book trade from medieval to modern. There is a bit of a loose feel to the flow between subjects, and the final take on the apocalyptic digitization and the death knell of the physical book is rather exaggerated in some cases; at one point they show an image of someone riding a physical bike in a VR headset, which is downright funny. Still, the passion is evident in the stories and creates an enjoyable experience. (4/5)",1

3152,Bull is a film about a young teen girl who has been on the wrong side of the tracks and how she winds up bonding with an aging bullfighter.  The two actors are pretty good here and make the story compelling...supporting players are a bit lacking and the ending just kinda is.... but the film was going for a level of observant realism,0
3153,"What starts out with much promise unfortunately loses its way in the final act with far too many underdeveloped and unresolved story threads. This tale of a wayward teen who starts finding her way in life under the reluctant mentorship of her crusty neighbor, a onetime rodeo bull rider beset by borderline addiction issues and chronic health problems, veers off in too many directions that one hopes will eventually come together but don't. While director Annie Silverstein's refreshingly unconventional approach frequently defies expectation in many entertaining and enlightening ways, the filmmaker frequently doesn't seem to know what to do with these developments once she introduces them, especially in the area of character development. Thus the powerful and intriguing setup that emerges in the first two acts is regrettably squandered in the home stretch as the narrative fails to coalesce in a cohesive and impactful way. To the film's credit, Rob Bowman's outstanding lead performance as the aging former rodeo star helps to hold things together well, but even that is ultimately not enough to save this aspiring but wanting debut feature.",0
3154,"I love Rob Morgan and he's great, but there just ins't enough connective tissue or words on the page to recommend this.

Allow me to use that word ""writing"" LOOSELY as this duo give us a clunker and that's no 'Bull'.   It's cast (other than Morgan) poorly and it's a slog.  This could have easily and should have been a short.  It wasn't worth my time.  Final Score: 3.8/10",0

As a Houstonian I really wanted this to be better than it was, and at the same time, it was much better than I was expecting.
Rob Morgan is really terrific and there is a really effective display of naturalism that balances the dangerous with mundane.

I understand there were cultural undertones and I appreciate that and my gripes are not with that. It's an ok watch if you're into the Zombie genre.

**Spoiler: near the end, the 'cool/wise' grandad makes the ultimate dumbass decision of staying behind because of his pride for the land. I say it was a dumbass thing to do because the whole movie he was portrayed as a wise skilled warrior who could have protected the last survivors but no, fuck them, he chooses to die and let them fend for themselves because reasons. The last people who survive...what's gonna happen to them? There's no satisfying resolution. Are they going to float off into the sea? How are they going to feed the baby?

Very little time is spent on actual data, factual reconstruction, and careful analysis - but spends 90% of it's time looking into multiple possible D.B.

They begin by telling the tale of the highjacking, through interviews with the airline staff and passengers, both current and televised interviews from back when it happened. They stick to the facts of what happened but it's quite intense and intriguing. ....


They then start getting into the different suspects and go through two rounds of interviews with the family, friends, investigators and researchers who explain why they believe this specific man was D.B. Cooper. They're all fairly credible as they certainly believe their own stories and reasons and most are seemingly rational individuals - the ""proof"" they have for their respective suspects is pretty compelling. The second round of interviews fleshes it all out a bit more and adds more weight to each of their stories. ....


It's a fun and more lighthearted mystery than most whodunnits since no one was injured or killed in this crime and so many people could have been D.B.",1

The party at the south station(which is the Chinese name of this film) was a brutal feast, with people from all walks of life circling around like vultures, waiting for the opportunity to pounce on the dying man and take their share of the surplus value. The director has rather capriciously placed a scene of killing secondary characters in a zoo at night, making the caged beast with its eyes wide open in the light and shadows an explicit rhetoric of Zhou Zenong's fate.",1

É aqui que conhecemos Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), sua família problemática composta pela mãe Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), Sherlock (Henry Cavill) e pelo chato do Mycroft (Sam Claflin) - e que elenco maravilhoso! Eu curto demais essa linguagem que equilibra a quebra da quarta parede com flashbacks da criação de Enola para nos deixar a par da história da protagonista. O filme tem ótimas reviravoltas, os eventos se encaixam perfeitamente e o roteiro bem amarradinho nos deixa muito interessados em saber o que vai acontecer. Uma das coisas que gosto muito, aqui, é que o namoradinho Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) não é corajoso nem precisa salvar a mocinha. Bem pelo contrário, ele é desengonçado e constantemente precisa ser salvo por ela - e essa subversão é natural e divertida. Gosto de como mostram que a mãe de Enola não é 100% correta em deixar a filha para trás, mas que faz um sacrifício que considera fundamental - e que a faz sofrer de verdade. O filme também faz críticas ao machismo, à sociedade patriarcal e não deixa de considerar a participação dos homens, que precisam ser conscientizados. Eu simplesmente adoro!",1

3214,thought this was great fun. After the first one I read all the available books and the historical elements are well managed. That is true in this film. (No romance in the books.),1
3215,Really enjoyed this film easy watching and pleasant viewing,1
3216,"FANTASTIC story... well-placed humor, edge of your seat suspense sprinkled in, and extremely detailed but easy to follow who-done-it. Will watch this over and over!!!",1
3217,"Quirky and endearingly entertaining, MBB is superb.",1
3218,"Fails to deliver! There will be spoilers. I hung in with this slow movie because the premise of a young man from modest means setting his heart on becoming a somelier was intriguing. Unfortunately, although the movie set the viewer up for an uplifting emotional payoff, it doesn't reward the viewer with the ending we deserve. I waited 104 minutes for a happy ending that never appeared.",0
3219,Uncorked perfectly depicts the hard won and often grudging love a son forges with his father. And to think it was done in a movie about wine. I recommend!,1
3220,Amazing performance from the lead. Solid story and doesn't take itself too seriously. The twists and turns the story takes only feeds into how well of the writing is and the flawless execution of and production.,1
3221,"I enjoyed it.
The rap music was crap, but not overly annoying.
I did enjoy the fact that Eli's being the only black man in the white wine world was never mentioned.
The father-son turmoil was a bit contrived.",1
3222,"Some how it was all a bit flat, with pockets of depth and then more flatness. The soundtrack was poorly overseen. Just hiphop.... Wine like music is about variety and digging deeper. This film could have been edited into a 60min short story.... I thought his mum and dad were brilliant casted.",0
3223,"It has its fair share of heartfelt moments but ultimately feels a little flat. Enjoyable, but not memorable.",0

3226,"I enjoyed this film for the most part. The story was original. The acting was very good. Great scenery. I thought I was going to love it, but the soundtrack felt incongruent with the film. You have this warm family comedic mellow drama with vulgar aggressive rap as the score. It was annoying. I'm still giving it a good review for the promise that the film held.",1
3227,Unique and relatable about reaching your dreams despite what your family wants you to do. It also has some bad father-son relationship that was tested during a unfortunate situation. A certain scene performance really stood out with the actor too.,0
3228,Terrible do not watch!,0
3229,"The movie Willoughbys is so cool, I love it because it has aventure and because it is about 4 brothers, they go thru a difficult situation and for this they made a fake invitaton, to surprise their parents, in this invitation there are information to a travel. Their parents are so terrible with them.",1
3230,It is an AMAZING movie. I 100% recommend.,1
3231,"It's a good, not great movie- it shows more than it tells and that's a good thing. though it doesn't show ""emotional manipulative scenes"" as most Disney pixar movies have come to do so- this may leave the status quo audience wanting more- but if you like whitty mean dialogue, creative visuals (creative not psychedelic), and a twist or two at the end. watch it. This movie, in its bottom line, survives by the charisma of its leading cast of characters- the Willoughby children.",1
3232,This Is My Favorite Movie!,1
3233,SUCKS my sister made me watch it 100 times and i hate it,0
3234,We didn't like this movie. The plot isn't funny and has no positive message. I wish we had picked another movie,0
3235,"I liked the animation style. That is it. The story is bad, the singing is deafening and that disgusting thing the parents do with their throat is enough  for me to tear my eyes out. This is the sort of movie you put on for the children to watch so you can go take a nap.",0
3236,"‘The Willoughbys' combines wonderfully vibrant animation that looks great (it's CGI, but it has the aesthetics of stop-motion, mimicking physical textures like wool) with a story that has lots of lovely elements (and some dark ones, too), even if it's a bit all over the place when it comes to the tone. The delightful characters are well-written and voiced by a fantastic cast, including a genius move in hiring Ricky Gervais as the narrator who's a cat; the script is funny and has some original and modern ideas that I loved to see, but what's important is the very human core that revolves around family and the need for love. It's quite different from what you might expect from an animated feature aimed at kids and I enjoyed seeing that. In the end, I think it's heartfelt, genuine, and touching.",1
3237,This is the film equivalent of rat poison. Thats all that can be said about this movie.,0
3238,Taylor Swift has always been an authentic person and I love this portrayal of her personal struggles and highlights of her career and life,1

3240,"Insightful documentary actually provides a quite thorough and intimate portrait of Taylor Swift, revealing her way to create and her issues with her personal success; and plainly, she appears to be a genuinely thoughtful and likeable human being.",1
3241,"An example of an amazing and impactful documentary. An inspiring, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, and empowering view on Swift's journey to the top.",1
3242,"it's good but it's not the best documentary I've ever seen, great to show behind the scenes of a star who suffers from not positioning himself in politics until a certain year.",1
3243,Best documentary to exist.,1
3244,I adore Taylor after watching it.,1
3245,I thought it might be elucidating for me to watch this since I actually have in no way followed this pop star's trajectory.  It was interesting for that purpose for me.,0
3246,"Wonderful documentary that shows us the life of a great and busy artist. At times very emotional, at others very joyful. A real eye-opener of how tough it can be, for famous people etc
The only thing that bothers me is the poster, which is terribly edited...",1
3247,Um dos melhores documentários já feito. Como fã esse documentário foi um prato cheio pra me aprofundar ainda mais na historia da Taylor e conhece-la ainda mais,1

3257,Very good movie - suspenseful with a few good twists and a great ending!,1
3258,"The Perfect Candidate is a wonderfully subtle and not at all on-the-nose movie in its feminist message. It takes an important look into the changing Saudi society when it comes to basic women's rights, making it very timely as it captures this important period effortlessly. The acting is great and the ending is quite moving. This is an even better, more confident movie from Haifaa al-Mansour than her previous feature, Wadjda. Both films were snubbed by the Academy for some reason.",1
3259,"I wanted to like 'The Perfect Candidate' much more than I did, but it's all too often unfocused and wandering.  There's a subplot here that sometimes engulfs the film.  When on track and focused on the titular character, this Saudi Arabian feature is best.  There are quite a few cliche moments, in this female empowerment story.  Final Score: 5/10",0
3260,"Well worth watching. Well paced, humourus and interesting insight into (some) women's lives in the ME. Great performance from the leading lady.",1
3261,"I loved the movie!  A chance to get a glimpse of Saudi society. Very nicely done. Well acted, nice music and touching.",1
3262,"Terrific screenplay showing family conflict, personal growth, cultural/religious background, and political dynamics.  The basic story is about the eldest daughter in a family of Saudi musicians who has become an MD because she has stagefright, and who signs up to be a candidate for the rural municipal council as an offhand byproduct of trying to get a computer error corrected so she can have permission to leave the Kingdom and attend a conference in Dubai that will give her a chance for a job in Riyadh that will get her out of the anti-woman bias at her local medical clinic.  On top of everything else, the film gently satirizes modern political campaigning.",1
3263,"A subtle, yet steadfast account of the types of oppression being challenged and overcome by women like Haifaa Al-Mansour. Her characters are likeable, with the family and their lives being relatable. Its approach isn't about drama or high levels of tension, but instead focusses on the everyday lives of people",1
3264,The animation is amazing!!! You just get so connected with the characters!,1
3265,The movie is pretty delocated and intertwined with Japanese culture and anectode.  It also give you the atmosphere of adolescent love.,1

3280,"Alone is a thrilling psychological ride through the Oregon wilderness, pontificating on the danger of Jeep drivers.

3284,"Slow, but intense build up to very scary events.  I even jumped a couple of times but there is a little gore, and I had to look away.  It is a quite good movie.  I know that Rotten Tomatoes has rated it very highly, but sometimes I disagree with their opinion, for example with ""Midsommar,"" and ""The Lighthouse.""  I personally think ""The Lighthouse"" is one of the worst movies I have seen.  Anyway, I recommend seeing this movie.",1

3287,"Genuinely terrifying movie. While the scares are nothing new, the dark atmosphere and presentation are fantastic. Recommended for all horror fans",1
3288,"watchable, decent acting, decent production values, but the movie is just derivative and slow. idk why some of the reviews seem to claim this brings something new to the table. it's a very conventional horror film, albeit not having any corny teenagers or pseudo-emotional scenes. it's just that nothing was surprising or scary about it for me. seeing people seriously harm themselves in gory detail isn't easy to watch, and surely will appease some horror fans, but this idea that ""the antagonist makes you hallucinate until you harm yourself or others"" has been done a million times. i'm not feeling like i want my couple of hours back, but this movie is just not notable. if it's lauded as niche and artsy horror then it's because there is such a low bar for the genre due to the love of camp.",0

3294,"Humble stories like this are usually performative showcases in amplifying a screenplay's stirred drama for empathetic understanding in acknowledging difficulties that life tend to harden as one's challenge towards true inner strength. Another effect from this particularity is demonstrating potential connections between two different, diverse, layered backgrounds, eventually bonding with a caring grasp that film gracefully captures whilst under thematic recognition. This third adaptation of its novel is a generational welcoming with a well-framed portrait that backs up the title, best elevated by Loren and Gueye's chemistry as they expressed the discussed prompt exceptionally. (B+)",1
3295,"The Life Ahead tells the emotional and tear-jerking story of a Holocaust survivor (Sophia Loren) who takes in a young orphan (Ibrahim Gueye) who recently robbed her. The film is fantastic overall.  Despite making rarer film appearances as time goes by, Sophia Loren as always puts on a phenomenal performance especially as the fierce yet patient Madame Rosa. The music in the film is fantastic as well especially the original song Io sì (Seen) by Diane Warren & Laura Pausini. The film's costume design had nuanced moments especially with the costumes worn by Sophia Loren because what she wore is what truly symbolized the entire film. The Life Ahead is a film that has wonderful complexity because throughout the film, we see an imaginary lion through the perspective of the young boy as the lion specifically symbolizes strength, courage, patience, and power. That's what The Life Ahead is. A film about strength and courage. Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren) had the strength to take in Momo despite his troublesome attitude. Momo had the strength and courage to find purpose because of Madame Rosa. The Life Ahead is a fantastic and emotional film that not only proves Sophia Loren's acting abilities are still extravagant but the film also tells us the true meaning of strength and patience.",1
3296,"With veiled meanings, stories not entirely explained on purpose, but brought to light with ingenuity, so The Life Ahead manages to establish itself as one of the best films by Edoardo Ponti and the glorious Sophia Loren, son and mother. For anyone who knows Sophia Loren (impossible), they know that she's a guarantee and a pleasure to see on screen; woman with a unique charisma, the representation of a Naples that was, representation of the diva and the humble, woman of the people and of the dreamers, art made woman, cinema made woman, once again manages to enchant in her so simple speeches, but so effective. Ibrahima Gueye, an amazing revelation, who manages, despite his debut, to act as a coachman for a tough film (by theme) to carry on. A motivated, incisive and clear Edoardo Ponti, with a warm and simple direction (not always in-depth and scrupulous), but perfect for representing a story of depth, thus bringing life not only to the story, but giving images to a novel that is already spectacular in itself.",1
3297,A very touching storyline.,1
3298,Superb Bari set drama with a stand out child performance to sit alongside Loren's welcome re-appearance. A subtle tear jerker as the emotional moments are not overplayed and neither are the back stories. Also a perfect length with good character acting in support. What sounds like a corny story is credible and powerful. Also shows it is worth trawling back through 20th century novels (this one by Romain Gary) to find material. Recommended.,1
3299,"Edoardo Ponti is indeed the great film producer's son, and had directed his mother Sophia Loren in a very powerful and believable story of good over evil. This movie is so well acted, so engaging, and one that will be hard to forget. Not to mention the great Sophia Loren at 86. Her performance is epic.",1
3300,Child actor Ibrahima Gueye is a rare gem! The closing theme by Laura Pausini is one surprise bonus too.,1

""Cuando pierdes la esperanza, suceden cosas buenas""

Sumario:

Debo confesar que tenía las peores prevenciones frente a esta película, temiendo un producto sensiblero o demagógico. Pero me he encontrado con una notable pintura de sus dos protagonistas, la octogenaria Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren) y el pequeño Momo, en un relato sobre el encuentro de dos sobrevivientes y sus desamparos, de dos destinos muy golpeados, al final y al comienzo de sus vidas.

Si bien el relato se ciñe a un sobrio realismo de a ratos bastante duro, no escatima oportunos toques de un humor muy italiano a cargo de la propia Rosa y momentos genuinamente conmovedores donde se mezclan una profunda tristeza, lo irremediable, la esperanza y el consuelo.

Como dice Madame Rosa: ""cuando pierdes la esperanza, suceden cosas buenas""

Reseña:

Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren) es una ex prostituta sobreviviente de Auschwitz. En su casa de Bari alberga en forma temporaria a hijos e hijas de trabadoras sexuales y también los cuida mientras ellas trabajan. Un día, su médico y amigo el Dr. Coen (Renato Carpentieri) le encomienda el cuidado de Momo, un huérfano senegalés de 12 años de quien era tutor (Ibrahima Gueye), con quien iniciarán una conflictiva convivencia.

Debo confesar que tenía las peores prevenciones frente a esta película de Edoardo Ponti (hijo de la Loren y el también legendario productor Carlo Ponti), temiendo un producto sensiblero o demagógico. Pero me ha sorprendido para bien.

Está muy lograda la pintura de los dos protagonistas, una octogenaria Madame Rosa acarreando como puede ciertos traumas de su pasado y los crecientes achaques de la edad y un Momo poco dispuesto a resignar su libertad y una cierta independencia económica, basada en el trabajo de venta de drogas en la calle para un traficante local.

Desde ya que se pone en el tapete la problemática de la inmigración africana al sur de Italia y también una brecha de clase muy evidente cuando vemos a Momo y a sus clientes. Como todo niño, Momo necesita desesperadamente figuras tutelares masculinas y femeninas que lo guíen y lo amparen.

El encuentro de Madame Rosa con Momo es el de dos sobrevivientes y sus desamparos, el de dos destinos muy golpeados al final y al comienzo de la vida y si bien el relato se ciñe a un sobrio realismo de a ratos bastante duro, no escatima oportunos toques de un humor muy italiano a cargo de la propia Rosa y momentos genuinamente conmovedores donde se mezclan una profunda tristeza, lo irremediable, la esperanza y el consuelo.

La Loren nos regala un gran personaje, totalmente antiglamoroso y querible, mientras que el pequeño debutante Gueye interpreta a la perfección esa combinación de niño desorientado y pequeño adulto. 

(Spanish / English)

""When you lose hope, good things happen""

Summary:

I must confess that I had the worst precautions against this film, fearing a maudlin or demagogic product. But I have come across a remarkable painting of  its two protagonists, the octogenarian Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren) and the little Momo and a story about the meeting of two survivors and their helplessness, of two very beaten destinies, at the end and at the beginning of their lives.

Although the story sticks to a sober realism at times quite hard, it does not skimp on opportune touches of a very Italian humor by Rosa herself and genuinely moving moments where deep sadness, the irremediable, hope and consolation are mixed .

As Madame Rosa says: ""when you lose hope, good things happen""

Review:

Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren) is a former Auschwitz surviving prostitute. In her home, Bari, she temporarily shelters the sons and daughters of sex workers and also cares for them while they work. One day, her doctor and her friend Dr. Coen (Renato Carpentieri) entrusts her with the care of Momo, a 12-year-old Senegalese orphan of whom she was her guardian (Ibrahima Gueye), with whom they will begin a conflictive coexistence. .

I must confess that I had the worst precautions against this film by Edoardo Ponti (Loren's son and the also legendary producer Carlo Ponti), fearing a corny or demagogic product. But it has surprised me for good.

The painting of the two protagonists is very successful, an octogenarian Madame Rosa carrying as she can certain traumas from her past and the growing ailments of age and a Momo unwilling to give up her freedom and a certain economic independence, based on sales work of drugs on the street for a local dealer.

From now on, the issue of African immigration to southern Italy is brought to the fore, as well as a very evident class gap when we see Momo and her clients. Like every child, Momo desperately needs male and female guardian figures to guide and nurture him.

Madame Rosa's encounter with Momo is that of two survivors and their helplessness, that of two fates that were hit hard at the end and at the beginning of life, and although the story sticks to a sober realism at times quite hard, it spares no opportune touches of a very Italian humor by Rosa herself and genuinely moving moments where deep sadness, the irremediable, hope and consolation are mixed.

Loren gives us a great character, totally anti-glamorous and lovable, while the little newcomer Gueye perfectly interprets that combination of disoriented child and small adult.",1
3302,"Beautifully filmed, capturing aspects of life in southern Italy really well. Strong performances all round - Sofia Loren turning in a convincing performance as Madam Rosa. Hard to believe La Loren is now 85.",1
3303,"Cuenta una historia poco novedosa y que se pudo desarrollar más, pero es bonita, sus actuaciones están bien, y la canción ""Ío si"" de Laura Pausinni al final completa el objetivo de llegar al corazón.",1
3304,Couldn't even finish it,0
3305,The script is quite interesting and dialog sharp.,1
3306,"I really wanted to like this film, and for about the first 35 minutes, I was quite enjoying it.  But gradually, it became less and less credible, and it became apparent that Spike Lee simply wasn't up to the challenge of making of the movie he intended to make.  Rather, he made the movie a person who was once gifted and talented ended up making.",0
3307,"The plot was mundane, uninspired, and inconsistent. The writing was stilted and the dialog was awful. Some of the cinemetography was alright, but overall a very bad movie.",0
3308,I feel like I need to watch this one again & give it a second viewing.,1
3309,"This Movie is so wrong in every way possible. I don't know how many Vietnamese people have been consulted for this movie but it's probably close to none.

Again, portrait Vietnamese as the vilains, wrong, American invade Vietnam, they just defend themself.

Show Vietnam as a dangerous place where Mafia gang are everywhere. Probably one of the safest country I lived and traveled.

Show Vietnamese people as resentful where in reality  they are the most forgiving people in the world. 1000 years of Chinese occupation, 60 years of French colonisation, leading to 2 wars with France then US. Yet, they have no grudge against French and Americans. Just go there and see by yourself! 

Mines everywhere -_- what about the huge campaign to de-mining and huge effort to destroy all the explosives.

The scenario is so incoherent and go in all the direction with saying everything and nothing. Absurd. 

Hopefully Spike Lee made some masterpiece to overcome this abomination",0
3310,"It's plot sits on the edge of unrealistic but its message and linkage of our current world troubles with ""foreign/alien"" policies of the major powers is certainly very moving",1
3311,"1ya- Despite strong acting and intriguing direction, the film occasionally feels clunky and over long without the cohesion and impact of Lee's previous efforts.",0
3312,"garbage.  Will Hollywood ever make a Vietnam war film from the Vietnamese point of view?  nope (not if directors like Lee have anything to do with it).  This time its ""da bloods"" turn to exploit Vietnam and shoot up some natives.  But hey, Lee has a message… not sure what that is, but does seem to involve BLM taking a holiday in the jungle to the sound of Marvin Gay and M L King clips.  Are they now back to reflect on the past, show some remorse maybe? are you kidding? these guys are as much blameless victims of oppression as the Vietnamese.  But now knowing they were victims of a white man's war, are they now back to make amends with their Asian brothers? well if you think killing them and stealing millions from their impoverished country (average salary less that $1 an hour) counts, then yes.  anyway, who cares, here's another MLK clip and some Marvin Gay to keep the brothers going. And if all that's not enough, Lindo has some ""critically acclaimed"" angry whining and religious gibberish to remind us just how big a victim he really is.  Is this really poignant ""critically acclaimed"" acting? Or just tedious self indulgent nonsense?  Again who care, here's some more Marvin. Lindo is (thankfully) finally shot full of holes by some baddy locals, but annoyingly still wont shut up about himself even after being turned into a human colander, still rabbiting on from beyond the grave... Oh God, please just shut up a die.  This is so bad it actually makes films like Rambo 2 look good.",0
3313,"Spike Lee knows how to grip in leading an urgent discussion in re-evaluating the relevance of the periodical topic that still echoes and lessened in caring discussions, making this a timeless reality knock under thought-provoking consideration – and a half of another discussion under indirect complementary. There's understandable dissatisfaction in how it progressed when abruptly transitioned into another narrative's conventional bleeding, alongside sporadic archival captures as bold disturbances, as it favorably starts out expositional and scenically develops towards the goal till tested under environmental historical repeat. The point of discussion is converse and raise questions, and that defines the overall flow plus reasoned logic when adding postwar effects and generational trauma onto cases between race and subtly class. Intellectual thematic coverage frames an ambitious scope with powerful performances and exceptional aesthetics towards production merits, making this essentially engaging viewing genuinely among Lee's best joints.

But if the evidence of a good film is one that stays with you, this is it. Everyone in the film is damaged by the War in different ways and everyone is searching for love to heal themselves. Iva seeks love from Masha, who can only find it in a child. Sasha also seeks love from Masha but he is naive. The other important character is Nikolai the Medical Director, like Iva a profoundly decent person trying to do his best in very difficult circumstances. This is definitely not to everyone's taste as among other things it js quite slow and long. And l have to say l found Masha much more interesting than Iva. A real survivor.",1
3336,"Two characters in the squalor and misery of post-war Leningrad communicate mostly by scowling and staring at the floor in each other’s presence, while awful, depressing things happen and they make additional awful life decisions. The painfully slow pacing may be intended to make the viewer feel the misery more immediately, and if so, it works.",0
3337,"Spoilers: Vasilia is so luminous yet war-ravaged, and pale Viktoria is so languidly genuine yet damaged by war. By the numbers, when the Germans ran a WWII siege of Leningrad that lasted 872 days, a million in the city died, most by starvation, as food was largely cut off. And many more fled, so that the city was largely depopulated. This is what is troubling these people, as they try to resume or rebuild lives, as wounded are still dying and the survivors may be worse off than the dead, psychologically as well as in coming by food, and electricity blackouts are common. Iya keeps freezing up, as these people say, going into minicatatonic episodes, and none seem to be shocked by it happening as they've seen it before -- what we'd attribute now to PTSD. One cost the young child his life, as Iya was caring for him yet inadvertently suffocated him. At her hospital job, she had a series of euthanasia jobs, as her doctor boss kept asking her to do it to those who no longer wanted to live. When the best thing you can do for someone is inject him out, it takes a toll on you. And when Masha,  the soldier mother of the dead boy, returns, she finds her boy gone, and wants Iya to have a child for her, and extorts her and Iya's boss into sleeping with Iya just to get her pregnant. In the all-time meet the boyfriend's upscale government service parents dinner from hell, Masha reveals she is sterile after abortions and had slept with a series of soldiers, as sort of campfire Annies too served the USSR, and were not fighters at all. And her boyfirend's mother says her son is too soft to get through any hard times with her, as he storms out of the dining room, and the relationship with Masha disintegrates on the spot. Everyone at the dining table knew everyone else was telling the hard truths, which was actually refreshing. So Masha and Iya, living in one small apartment, conclude they have only one life-affirming dream and path to carry them on -- Iya having a baby the two could raise together, which, though unrealized, is the high note of a narrative of bleakness. Detail was rich, and the plotting and script were inventive, and the acting, superb. The term beanpole referred to tall, thin Iya, who was called that. But it is layered, as a beanpole is just a tall pole with no meat on it. And that is what was left of Leningrad, as the whole surviving population had to rebuild life, commerce, infrastructure, sufficiency of all sorts, as well as the just as important inner lives of dreams, hopes, ambitions and directions of the people. An interesting and unusual take. Living without war is way better than picking up the pieces after war. Bravo!",1

As a result, viewers expecting a family drama may feel that the horror additions are superfluous, while those expecting a horror film may feel that the horror is just a sort of surface element to cover the reflection of a family drama.",0
3345,"For it's date (2020) this movie is a good one and I do love all things UK.  So seeing it back in 2020 it would have seemed more innovative than it does today.

But here in 2022 some of the elements seem a bit dated and that says something for how fast these films in general (and the horror genre specificially) are progressing in quality.

Absolutely love Emily Mortimer - she's such a grand actress - always so compelling; but would it really be possible to find a bad actress in this part of the world, remembering that they're all descendants of The Bard ?",1
3346,"An unsettling affair that achieves most of its victories through the gradual building of suspense. Less is more and the subtlety is what makes Relic compelling. A shadow. A background. A sound. It's all quite carefully assembled that when it finally builds to its inevitable crescendo, you don't realise how uncomfortable the previous 90 minutes had been.

Its final act perhaps takes itself too seriously and applies its clever theme a little too literally, but doesn't detract from an overall impressive attempt.",1
3347,Why on earth is this rated so highly? I'd give it a 10% (at a push). There was practically no story line and it just felt totally pointless. 1 hour 29 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Please don't bother watching.,0

3350,"Relic uses what seems to be a demonic possession, and the imagery of mold, to talk about dementia and how it affects the family. It's a very sensible subject that can make the movie hard to watch but despite the promise that can sound exploitative it's a very intelligent movie that use slow burns, emotional stakes and creative visuals to share its message. The acting is also a strong point here, the three actresses playing the grand-mother, the mother and the daughter succeed in the intense challenge that asks this movie. As a horror movie, it works very well despite few scary moments, the atmosphere is oppressive and the climax is worth the slow building.",1
3351,"D: A huge disappointment. I thought it was going to be a supernatural horror film. It's really just about how a certain type of black mold can make you really sick and mentally ill. That's it. What's worse, the mold is growing all over the house throughout the movie, and no one barely mentions it or bothers to clean it up. Also very boring, slow, not very scary, and filmed with what looks like cheap, washed out film stock.",0
3352,"While a lot of films, and especially horror films, deal with this theme of aging and dying in family, it's really hard to make it resonate on an emotional level while simultaneously be creepy and thrilling, and this pretty much does it. It maybe gets a bit too drawn out in the first half, just being a basic slow-burn, ominous horror film, but the second half really gets to some strong material that has you feeling its metaphors through it with imagery so hard to make in horror today. One of the best horror films of the last couple years.",1
3353,"This film is very strange because it manages to create an atmosphere of increasing tension by being scary and very deep at the same time, but in the end it is too fragmented, you don't understand much and the ending that wants to be deep and beautiful doesn't really have too much sense",0

3373,"Very good movie! Smart premise, great cast. This is the type of movie you can rewatch from time to time.",1
3374,"Super Mads Mikkelsen, his best film according to me.
The movie director gives you the sensation to be in the film, to live it in first person, without using special and particular effects.
A window on Scandinavian society, alcoholism and what pushes a man to drink alcohol with consequent effects.",1
3375,"Nobody does depression, alcohol and great movies like the Danes.  And this particular film about oh-the-hell-with-it drunken orgies seems to come so naturally to a country with the one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the entire world.

I've seen a lot of attempts to explain the ending but I prefer to leave it as a moment of ambiguity which to me seems like the perfect topper to a story that is anything but ambiguous !  

Considering the sudden collapse of his life as he once knew it, does his participation at the end, in an outrageous drunken orgy of students and faculty, indicate he's resuming his off-the-charts alcohol intake or is this display merely the swan song to his drinking days?  

Does his dive off the pier symbolize a death (by alcohol) wish or a final kicking of the habit?  Is it the burden of alcohol he's finally freed from in the end or the burden of a life without it?

Does the somewhat macabre (Mikkelsen is a professional dancer) dancing at the finale celebrate the glorious vodka saturated life of an alcoholic or his liberation from it?  And is this movie somehow a celebration of substance abuse and addiction with a strong nod in favor of it as a ""highly"" effective release from life's burdens.  

You have to love ambiguity to love how this movie ends.",1
3376,"Man, I can already tell this is going to be an intense drama. This is going to be a movie about youth vs. older age. I can relate to Martin, he seems kind of dead inside. I've worked in a school before so I know how soul-sucking it can be. He seems kind of disconnected with people as well. He's lost his lust for life. I love Mads man, he's such a great actor. I actually love how they're justifying their day-drinking by testing out Finn Skarderud's hypothesis of how human's are born with a deficit .05% blood alcohol content. It seems to definitely be working for Martin as his performance as a teacher has drastically improved. I love the way he introduced the three candidates for voting and how the third one happened to be Hitler. I guess you just have to drink a little bit to loosen up and enjoy the world. That part where the students start singing the hymn about Denmark had me crying, it was beautiful. And the way the teacher coaxed their voices out of them was inspiring.

I can't help but think that what's to come is something dark. What if these guys become alcoholics? I feel like Martin's on the road to becoming an alcoholic. He has the highest chance out of the four guys, or so it seems. I love how the little boy, Specs, scored a goal. That was so wholesome. Yup, now Martin's really gonna start drinking. I had a feeling his wife was cheating on him with another man when she said a particular thing in the tent. That final dance scene with Martin was great, Mads impressed me with his moves and nimbleness.

This movie has a great heart. It has plenty of beautiful moments throughout while also showing the dark side of life. Terrific writing and wonderful acting. Mads playing a depressed, low-spirited teacher who rediscovers his passion fro life is really a beautiful thing to see, a real treat. His performance is definitely the stand out one. Very eye-opening and enlightening, almost like a spiritual journey; only it's done through alcohol consumption. I haven't seen a lot of Danish movies, but the way they filmed this one, it has this sense of tension throughout that it almost felt like a horror/thriller movie at times. 

Lesson of the movie is: learn moderation when drinking, never lose your lust for life and find meaning in life and yourself. Although the story wasn't anything amazing, it was still entertaining and quite profound existentially. I don't think it's something I'd watch again, but I definitely recommend it. I feel like this movie would be ideal to watch if you're in the middle of an existential crisis or having trouble with alcoholism. It might speak higher volumes for people going through these things. But overall, great movie.",1
3377,"Good film, but not as good as I expected after so many enthusiastic recommendations. Nevertheless I liked it!",1
3378,"""Another Round"" or the Danish title ""Druk"" was a cinematic masterwork that has one of the greatest intellectual pleasant plot twists I have ever watched in my entire life, In the first hour of the movie I thought that it will depict and focus on the Danish alcohol culture, But the intricate plot had me recollecting my thoughts on the notions I acquired from Soren Kierkegaard's existential philosophy that interprets the dialogue in the movie and some of the scenes (Especially the ending).

Technically speaking, the cinematography was really superb and I loved some of the camera angles where they portrayed the beauty of the set design.

Finally, I gotta acknowledge the brilliance and cleverness of the whole cast, especially Mads Mikkelsen who delivered a splendid performance where he showed again that he's one of the best actors of his generation.

The ending scene was without any doubts the best movie moment of 2020.

Bravo Thomas and Mads.",1
3379,"This film focuses on an interesting social issue - alcoholism, primarily from a middle aged, middle class perspective (although not exclusively). The plot is quite slow to build and it felt a bit bland in the first half or so but it picks up a bit mid way through and the ending is certainly something to see, I'd say. Mads Mikkelsen gives a pretty decent performance, as a teacher unsure how much the drinking may affect his teaching. Its a quirky watch, more a piece of somewhat thoughtful social commentary than anything else - I wouldn't say its hilarious or really dramatic but its certainly not bad. A curious watch. I wouldn't expressly recommend this unless the plot really intrigues you or your a big fan of the cast.",0
3380,"A really fun comedy drama. It can make you laugh and tear up in matter of minutes. It's a bit slow at first, but the top notch acting makes it bearable. I'ts a diferent type of film, but totally worth it.",1
3381,"The inferno inside that fire is awe inspiring to see, and the devastation is brutal. The aftermath is full of things that you'd only come to understand once a catastrophe like this unfolds. Also showing the side of humans helping a community to rebuild their lives makes for a good story in this documentary.",1
3382,"So sad what happened to this community. This doc gives an inside look. A lot of things about the rebuild and fire prevention could have been explained better, but the human element of this film made it very moving.",1
3383,Ron Howard's likability shines through as he shows the turmoil of the citizens of paradise after they experience the harness of nature.,1
3384,"'Rebuilding Paradise', a documentary film from Ron Howard about the wildfires that destroyed Paradise, California, hits you hard early, but, for me, it missed the mark.  I wanted the political side of things, not the story of the rebuild.  It's emotional and interesting at times, but a lot of the people being interviewed are just boring.  It's powerful and a tear should be shed, however, the final 30 minutes were a slog.  When the movie gets political it's good and when it doesn't it falls flat.  It's a tad unfocused with the tonal changes of who's to blame and how to fix the situation.  Final Score: 5.7/10",0
3385,"Solid documentary from Ron Howard about the rebuilding of the town of Paradise, which was destroyed by the Camp Fire in 2018... The story of what happened to that town is devastating and this film follows the aftermath of the fire and the efforts of the citizens to rebuild.",1
3386,"What an emotional movie, so worth watching....",1
3387,"Director Ron Howard, in a rare documentary effort, examines the impact of the deadly wildfire that destroyed nearly all of the historic California town of Paradise and the widespread fallout that has come in its wake. From terrifying footage of the fire as it burned (shot from inside the inferno) to the grim aftermath of its destruction to the valiant efforts of residents to rebuild their shattered lives, this heart-wrenching yet hopeful offering details the pain and suffering experienced by virtually everyone in the community, as well as their determination to rise from the ashes (literally and figuratively) in overcoming the many obstacles hindering the town's rebirth. It's rare that a documentary will move viewers quite as profoundly as this one does, evoking both tears and joy -- and making us appreciate what we have and what we can lose in a heartbeat. Easily one of the best productions from director Howard in quite a long time, now available for first-run online streaming and limited theatrical screenings.",1
3388,"Premature was a slow burn, which is fairly surprising given it's 80-minute run time. Despite being possibly light on material, the movie is gorgeously filmed and acted, with performances so genuine you ache right along with the characters when they hurt. Occasionally the dialogue is a little formal, especially for teenagers, but it's fairly easy to accept given the precocious and somber mood of the film. I wish director Rashaad Ernesto Green was able to incorporate the artistic passions of his two main characters to be more strongly tied to the movie's themes, rather than just a plot device to draw them together in the beginning.",1

Director, Rashaad Ernesto Green, shot this on 16mm film, I don't always pick up on stuff like that, but you can't not with a film like this. The look and dialogue sets up a very authentic atmosphere. The conversations between characters and the way the love scenes are filmed reminded me of ""She's Gotta Have It"" and other early Spike Lee work. Zora Howard's performance is incredible! She should be a star already. 8.6/10.",1

As I was watching it, I remembered some important work to do but its radiancy was such that I just couldn't leave it. The main character's persona spiraling down into a delusionary state was both unnerving and devastating to watch. This movie clearly brings out the horrors of being alone and the frantic attempt to find a meaning for their life. How religiously delirious one can become just to garner some attention and lead a life with supposed ""meaning"" can be seen in a frightening way through this film. Humans are social animals and if left alone, their own power of imagination and consciousness can turn up against them. This movie brings out the pain of people suffering from PTSD and how they dearly need one's support. The movie is perfectly directed and edited with some really powerful scenes. I am just glad that I watched it.",1

'Nighthawk' easily engages due to it's rare blend of modernized western tropes, (mostly) unrecognizable cast and sociopolitical subject matter but it somehow avoids telling a an intriguing story or presenting significant arcs for it's characters.

3438,"Although filmed in 2018, well before the current global pandemic, ""Working Man"" presents themes that could not be more relevant to our times. It is a powerful microcosm of the enormous challenges faced by the average worker when their job no longer exists. The film artfully focuses on the psychological effects, even trauma, associated with finding ways to fill the day after a lifetime of punching a clock. Peter Gerety artfully portrays a man utterly lost without his job that has defined him for most of his adult life. And Talia Shire, a reliably skilled and seasoned actress, softly but powerfully walks the line between allowing her husband to explore his options, odd as they may be, and empowering him to do the right thing for himself, his family and most especially his fellow workers. The larger story of how a factory closure can devastate a small town yields to the even more significant theme of standing by others to achieve positive change against all odds. In a very gritty and realistic manner, the film allows us to experience the angst, even desperation of the main characters but does not leave us without hope and that is what makes it so relevant to our times. Talia Shire's character understands the empowerment of loyalty to those who stand by you and the need to courageously take the next best step and do the right thing even when all seems to be lost.

The sometimes oppressive feel of life in small town America that permeates much of the film, is superbly offset and balanced by the much larger themes of personal fortitude, perseverance and pride in oneself and in others. The idea that solutions to larger problems can come from a very few smaller individuals is very well illustrated and leaves the audience feeling uplifted by the possibilities when individuals join together across racial or ethnic lines for the greater good. It teaches a valuable lesson about the need to empower each other to overcome even the greatest obstacles. It also demonstrates that one's greatest fears need not derail them permanently provided they remain sensitive to the needs of those around them. Out of the very humdrum routine of everyday life can emerge the most powerful and inspiring themes that elevate a person well above what might appear to be an uninspired life. Inspiration can come at any time in one's life most especially for those who stay the course without allowing their circumstances to defeat or fully define them.

In the end, this film is a successfully and warmly drawn story of the how the human spirit can triumph even in the darkest of times particularly for those who are not afraid to stand up for what is right and the subsequent re-birth that occurs for those who stay the course and not allow themselves to be defeated or taken out by the curveballs in life. It is a credible tale of personal redemption and a reminder that it is never too late to make a difference or to change the trajectory of one's life and the lives of those around us. In short, a realistically uplifting tale for our times.",1
3439,"Spoilers: Gerety (Allery) looks beaten by life. Slogging to work, metal lunch box and thermos bottle, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, old, tired, quiet. Then even that goes. No more work, as his plastic widget factory closes, and he and co-workers all line up for their final checks. He seems so lost, hardly talks to the wife, he won't stop the ritual of going to work, eating lunch alone, after breaking into the factory and doing actual work of cleaning the place, the machinery, also alone. Seems the story is man loses job, it breaks his mind. But that ain't it. What broke him had nothing to do with work. His son went mentally ill, then took his own life. It pretty much made Allery  a zombie walking. When fellow laid-off co-worker Walter (Brown) sees him irrationally going to work, the two, mostly Walter, cook up a scheme to use the machinery and necessary resources still in the  factory to keep producing, and line up buyers and even bring in the laid off co-workers to help, all of them occupying, sleeping in  the place. The story seems to be workers fight to get jobs back, and do it. But that ain't it. Walter is a con man, but mostly an alcoholic with mental problems -- there are no buyers. So the jig is up at the factory, though reluctant leader Gerety gets more severance and some dough for the workers for the maverick work, as TV news had reported on the wildcat work and earned the workers sympathy. But what got fixed? Walter and Allery became friends after being comrades in arms at the factory, with Walter in a mental facility for at least a while, where Allery visits. And after Talia, in her raised voice a la Connie Corleone or Rocky's Adrian!, tells hubby Allery he stopped living long ago and she wants to live, he snaps out of it, sees the error of his tortured ways of losing his son, symbolically lays the son to rest for good, and resumes living, even dancing, at his and wifey's favorite restaurant. In the end, this is not about a working man but just a man. And life is what they win, beyond the searing, numbing  sadness and illness. They seem to learn that losing a job means go get another job, already, as it's only a job -- but live. The piece and some dialogue may be pat, particularly on the surface, but the acting pulls it through pretty well. We feel for and root for these working people.",1

3441,We got to see this film thanks to AARP movies. My husband and I thought it was inspiring and really provoked a good discussion. The characters were interesting and I am sure the closing factory was relatable to many. It was not a predictable story and the twists made it very interesting. The ending was great!,1
3442,This is a truly great film with an Oscar worth performance by Peter Gerety and excellent co-stars Talia Shire and Billy Brown.,1
3443,"Filmed over two years ago, 'Working Man' is a prime example of life imitating art and in these times it's a stark reminder of the mental illness that can come along with hard times.  Robert Jury wrote and directed a film that goes against the norms to what I like.  Usually, I'd say this about a script that is minimal: "" it's a short film stretched to feature length"".  No doubt, it could have been edited down a smidge, however it has a story to tell and boy does it ever tell that story!  This is an extremely effective and intimate portrait of what happens when we lose hope.  The film shows us there is a light at the end of the tunnel and sometimes all we need is others to life us through the tough times.  This movie shows empathy which is lost under the current orange in charge.  Powerfully acted by Peter Gerety, Billy Brown, and Talia Shire, make no mistake this is Gerety's picture.  The near 80-year old is brilliant.  Brown is layered and the chemistry between these two is heartwarming.  I cried, a lot, but I didn't laugh, however, thinking about 'Working Man' will make me smile for years to come!  Final Score:  9.3/10",1
3444,This movie was definitely an eye catcher it draws you in slowly and keeps you interested. I found so many different emotions that relate to real life and what some people don't get to see. Having families that struggle because corporate America changes things or the fact that mental stability can change for someone who doesn't even understand depression. All around a beautiful movie I give working man hands down 5 stars.,1
3445,"""Working Man"" could not be more relevant to these pandemic times in which we live. A powerfully personal tale of an ordinary man who feels he is totally defined by the job he no longer has after a lifetime of punching a clock. Peter Gerety offers a gritty and emotionally riveting performance as does Talia Shire who plays his supportive and wise wife who challenges him re-discover his identity apart from his work. More than the story of a factory closing, so poignant in these times, the film explores much larger themes of personal fortitude, perseverance, pride in oneself and most especially loyalty and empowering those around us while not allowing our circumstances to overwhelm or define us. ""Working Man"" is about the triumph of the human spirit during the darkest moments and a tale of personal redemption reminding us that it is never too late in life to make a difference or change the course of one's life. This really is a poignant and meaninful  and timeless film with important life lessons for our time.",1

3454,"August 7, 2020

Disney movies, and in this case, by ""Disney movies,"" I'm referring to the studio's popular line of traditional animated features that ruled the market for about a decade starting around 1990, have become so embedded in our collective consciousness that we might assume these staples of popular culture simply rolled off an assembly line, or were somehow easy to produce. I often think the same thing about modern Disney computer-animated fare or the now Disney-owned Marvel superhero films. Because of their popularity, prolificacy and digestibility, we tend to think any Disney movie doesn't take a whole lot of creative effort to pull off.

But that's obviously not true, and one of the lasting arguments of ""Howard,"" a thoroughly fetching and joyful documentary now available on Disney+, is there's reason Disney movies, particularly its once-dominant animated musicals, remain so universally appealing and timeless, and that's precisely because of their creativity, and it was lyricist Howard Ashman who played an integral role in it. For starters, Ashman helped pioneer the idea that songs, of all things, could actually be used to drive a story and plot, which seems obvious now, but as ""Howard"" points out, such a conceit wasn't obvious 30 years ago. In a way, Ashman spurred a new way of thinking about storytelling altogether, which is quite an achievement.

Ashman became a major player at Disney at time when the traditional Hollywood musical had all but faded from the moviegoing public's interest. He knew the idea of a character suddenly interrupting the narrative to sing a song was no longer appropriate or believable. After all, it was the late 1980s, decades after the Great Depression, an era in which it was more fitting for a woeful character to look off into the distance and sing about his or her ""want"" (think Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz""). Now such a notion seemed silly and out of style.

At least it did for live action, and one of Howard's gifts was recognizing that animation was different. He believed it was an area of film that opened up ""a whole new world"" of possibilities, one in which Broadway qualities could still be applied. He instinctively knew that in an animated space, song and dance could seamlessly blend into the narrative and feel natural, perhaps even stand out as the most memorable part of the production. Music and lyrics could still generate laughs, excitement, slapstick, romance and pathos, but they could also push the story forward instead of halting it.

We see this strategy work wonderfully and magically across Howard's short but indelible Disney repertoire, including ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin,"" so it doesn't take a whole to convince us of his genius or that he left a major mark on Hollywood. Luckily, then, ""Howard"" director Don Hahn, himself a longtime Disney movie producer, chooses not to make Howard's Disney movies the center of the documentary. ""Howard"" is ultimately more about a complex and talented man instead of an Oscar-winning lyricist who wrote popular songs such as ""Part of Your World,"" ""Under the Sea"" and ""Prince Ali"" for a major studio. One of the ways Hahn underlines this by having the renditions of Howard's catchy, well-known tunes we hear in this film be Howard's own test recordings instead of the polished finals versions.

Visually, ""Howard"" presents a wide array of still photographs, home movies, archival news interviews, and making-of footage from various Howard Ashman-produced pieces. Hahn has substituted the typical modern talking heads with recent auditory recollections from Howard's family, longtime partner, friends, bosses and co-workers. We also hear from Howard himself, who, despite passing away in early 1991 from complications related to AIDS, just prior to his 41st birthday, has a palpable screen presence, which speaks to his everlasting charm, eloquence and enthusiasm.

Given that ""Howard"" is, at the end of the day, a Disney production, which, it's no secret, prioritizes content of a safe and family-friendly nature, it's impressive and relieving the film allows itself to not always paint Howard's life as rosy and comforting as, well, a Disney movie. We get a fairly deep sense of his rich and complicated personal and professional travails, including the battles he faced as a gay man who came of age during a time when homosexuality wasn't as tolerated or accepted; as the better half to a partner who chose to live more riskily, particularly when it came to substance abuse and promiscuity; as an up-and-coming artist who often struggled to make ends meet and encountered many failures when he tried to graduate beyond small-time productions; and as an in-demand Hollywood talent who tragically became physically weak and sick because of AIDS within a very short timeframe.

Hahn nicely balances the darker, more serious memories related by the interviewees with equally upbeat ones, and collectively, Howard's wide-ranging experiences resemble a traditional Hollywood biopic, which, just like the songs he wrote, are probably why ""Howard"" is so watchable. We get a full yet concise spectrum of Howard's multiple ambitions and endeavors, from his humble beginnings in Baltimore, where he pursued entertainment right from the get-go, crafting his own stories, characters and sets in his room to put on a show on for his younger sister; to opening a real independent theater in New York City and adapting such works as Kurt Vonnegut's, ""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,"" which would mark his first collaboration with his longtime music composer partner, Alan Menken; to writing and producing the rock musical ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and later penning the screenplay for the feature film adaptation; to being recruited by Disney to write the lyrics for ""The Little Mermaid,"" which started a new Renaissance in Hollywood in which animation served as the new vessel for the dormant musical. 

Although it may play like an easy-to-read biography and isn't particularly complicated with its methods, ""Howard"" gives us plenty to learn, absorb, reflect upon, and smile about. It's touching and engaging for the simple fact it presents an exceptionally talented individual who worked hard to realize his dreams. Howard Ashman was often stubborn, yes, but he knew what he wanted, and by never settling for less, his audience reaped the benefits because his creations are (still) so entertaining. Plus, it's important to remember that ""easy-to-read"" and ""uncomplicated"" don't necessarily mean simple to pull off. One of the takeaways from the documentary is that it takes rhythm, calculation, trial-and-error, and input from many people for any story to come together fluidly and maintain momentum. Howard knew this and clearly bestowed it upon Hahn. Hahn, in turn, has nicely summed up not only Howard's legacy, but also the love and appreciation the world has for him.",1
3455,A well made documentary,1
3456,"""Howard"" shows the audience a new perspective on the life and death of Howard Ashman. Don Hahn not only focuses on Howard's Disney Legend status but also his life leading to ""Beauty and the Beast."" 

This film is accessible for fans of Howard Ashman and those who have only heard his lyrics. I enjoyed the audio interviews and archival footage from individuals in his personal and professional life. His collaborative partner, Alan Menken, composed the score for this documentary, and it flows throughout the music Howard wrote throughout his life. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the music of ""The Little Mermaid,"" Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""Aladdin.""",1
3457,"This documentary of an amazingly talented man struck down by AIDS is honest, raw, loving, and very well told. From the perspective of a gay man nearly 60-y/o, I view this as real social progress -- that Disney, keeper of all that is family-friendly would help tell the tale of a gay man whose life and career were cut short by AIDS. It's staggering to think how many people might now realize their lives have been touched by a person with AIDS.

Howard Ashman composed lyrics for top Disney properties THE LITTLE MERMAID, ALADDIN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS stage musical was purely his concept and vision.

This documentary had a similar effect on me as EVERY LITTLE STEP -- the story of how A CHORUS LINE came into being. My perspective and perception are changed and I'm compelled to revisit the work of Howard Ashman.",1
3458,"Stylish and visually insane, and definitely not recommended. Shame for the over-complicated script: wasn't necessary.",1
3459,"A unique film, 'We are Little Zombies' is a visual experience you'll have to see and perhaps see again.  I found myself missing dialogue as I was so entranced by the visuals which had a distinct old school video game feel.  The soundtrack to this film constantly made me smile, but also served as a distraction.  It's a Japanese film and with it comes subtitles.  This could be a tough watch if you're not into a lot of things going on.  It's a spectacularly busy flick, but it's never uninteresting.  Final Score: 7/10",1
3460,"The initial 35% or so is quite unusual and enjoyable.  Then the 'enjoyable' begins to rapidly evaporate.  Leaving only the 'unusual' behind.

3461,"Four kids meet and become connected when their parents are being cremated. The film starts out with the stories of what happened to their parents. Unable to deal with the grief associated with their loss, the kids form a band, Little Zombies. This is a film that is hard to describe adequately. It is a coming of age story. It is a film about young kids trying to deal with their feelings in the face of significant loss. It is also one of those movies about kids who form a band, create tunes that you cannot shake from your head, and become famous. There are some wonderful things about the film. The filming and camerawork are very inventive – the photographer captures the kids in motion from different and unusual angles. The shifting camerawork keeps the film moving forward and fun. One of the kids serves as the narrator, and he ensures you are never very far from the core of the friends' feelings. The screenplay is very well done; on the surface, it is one of those kid's programs that preteens watch on TV. But the stories of the kids and how they deal with their emotions (or lack of) feel very real and have substantial depth. And, of course, that song that just sticks in your brain. Big thumbs up for me for a film that is inventive, thoughtful, and insightful and told completely through the eyes of the kids experiencing loss. I loved it.",1
3462,"Explosively weird, but also enjoyably so, We Are Little Zombies is a colorful smorgasbord of creative filmmaking, as well as an exploration of dark emotional themes that speaks not only to the relatable kids out there, but to anyone trying to listen to their adolescent children.",1
3463,"End of Sentence is a very well made, well acted film with a good central story that sort of loses its way a bit in the final third. Sean Fogle is a young man just released from an Alabama prison. Before he was released his mother passed after a long battle with cancer. His father picks him up upon his release but Sean has major problems with Frank stemming over many years of issues. But Sean's mother wanted her ashes spread in her native Ireland, reluctantly Sean accompanies Frank on the journey which becomes a rather toxic road trip. This is a film about recrimination and lost moments, anchored by two wonderful performances from Logan Lerman and John Hawkes. It's a short and at times powerful film but it does lose track in the final third with an ill judged car chase. Overall though a film with some powerful moments.",1
3464,"In a road-trip movie, all you need is to like the characters and the actors, then the relationship. I found Logan Lermon and John Hawkes extremely likeable and Sarah Bolger too hot to ignore. I'd fight with my dad to take her on a road trip in a heartbeat. Then, the music. This has to be my favourite bunch of songs after the soundtrack of Elizabethtown. This movie itself is a perfect example of how small little generic formulas can still work with sensible writing without any extravaganza. The screenplay was also moving fast enough to never let me bored or too dampened by emotion or long monologue-ish moments. But it wasn't devoid of heartwrenching revelations either. All the 3 central characters are flawed and well aware of their negatives. Despite that, they went along without pretending who they should be, which was so refreshing. It's very easy to get carried away by throwing fun lighthearted moments in a road trip drama and lose focus in the process. Actually, I do wish I could spend more time with the 3 like in many other road trip films I came across. Cz end of the day, it's all an escapade. A welcome breath of fresh air from the complexities of other genre-films. That's the only thing that may keep it distant for me from other favs in this genre. Nevertheless, being in the right mind, I certainly appreciate the 1.5 hours I spent here. All 3 actors will be on my mind onwards. End of Sentence better not become the end of the good little road trip dramas. Thank God, it's not a comedy!",1
3465,Needs more Sarah Bolger,0
3466,"Well, looking at the critic's and the audience's reviews, I just can say it is very overrated. It shows a too simple story that fails to captivate the spectator. The cast didn't make it more interesting. The plot is cliched and predictable and if you're expecting some great inspirational lessons from this road trip you are very mistaken, don't fool yourself.",0
3467,"Sean gets out of jail and his father, Frank, picks him up. He has promised his now deceased wife to spread her ashes with they're son in Ireland. The relationship is not the best but they do take the trip. Will the relationship turn into something better or is it to hard to heal?

Well, not the most original plot but it's just fine, I guess. The execution is mostly mediocre and it has that typical ""now we need an uplifting scene"" and the darker ones. Not very hard to predict and very straight forward and safe. Not a disaster, but nothing special either. Fine acting, though.

5 out of 10 urnes.",0
3468,"I must admit I've become a John Hawkes completist and in recent time that investment has paid dividends. 'End of Sentence' sat on the shelf for a while and it turns out it was well worth the wait.  It's not perfect, but if personal struggle after loss is something you can handle then you must watch.  Some movies just connect and this one not only brought out the tears, but also helped me realize how much you need to love the ones that are present.  Few films can have this kind of an impact on a person.  This type of film has been done plenty but Hawks and Logan Lerman have a chemistry that fits.  The father and son pair seem mismatched at first, but the talented duo along with some beautiful music and cinematography make this one of the best under the radar film of 2020.  The trick you will have is finding it!  For free, try Hoopla, otherwise it's not a bad investment for a few bucks and a potentially life-changing movie!  Final Score: 9.4/10",1
3469,Such a touching father and son movie.,1
3470,"Even if you can see from the beginning where the road will bring you, some gentle scenes and acting made it worth my while.",0
3471,"Beautifully written; beautifully directed;  lovely, lovely film. Amazing score!",1
3472,"Alas, words almost fail me.  Just finished watching this film less than a minute ago and I am intensely most overcome.   The raw truth at the heart of a dysfunctional family is laid bare with well crafted layers of revelation showing a masterclass in screenwriting by Michael Armbruster.  Director Elfar Adalsteins and both leads John Hawkes and Logan Lerman are faultless and deservedly imprison your attention for every second of the film.  Beautiful. Thank you.",1
3473,"It is an admiring documentary, which is neither an advantaget or a flaw for itself, but while it is good (in large part because of Michelle Obama's charisma) it could have gone much deeper into its look at such a beloved and important public figure in the history of a nation.",1
3474,"""Becoming"", directed by Nadia Hallgreen, is a documentary, an autobiography released on May 7, 2020, witch don't even tell only the story of the 46nd First Lady of the United States, and also not even just of Barack Obama's wife. ""Becoming"" plot is about Michelle. The down-to-earth and inspirative one. The strong and sometimes not so strong one. Michelle Obama, next to her essence.

That's why this film is so incredible. Because it shows us that a person always is so much more than a title, an office or what people might think you are. It tells her story before and after she becomes the First Lady, in many different settings, from her humble beginning, showing that she was always a strong and positioned woman wherever she was; going through the time her family were in the White House, and how she work hard to adapt their lives in front of the cameras and all the world, but never losing their roots and sympathy; to after all of it. That's why ""becoming"". It means that her story is just beginning.

So, with a good pace - surely leading the audience to wishing it didn't have to end -, you'll certainly be inspired by Michelle's ideas and enthused by her bright personality. But, if you wanna more, you may also read her book, called ""Becoming"" either. However, only in the movie you'll get the dancing soundtrack which has everything to do with Michelle.

At the end, we see that she is a normal person. And, such as, if she can make the difference somehow, you and I can do it also. Between tears and laughs, this documentary is absolutely worth watching! :)",1
3475,"This was amazing. Ignore any bad reviews you see, as they are probably from racist haters.",1
3476,This movie is so shallow and circumspect that it doesn't actually reveal anything. It's more like a long advert than a documentary. I don't feel that I know anything more about Michelle Obama and her life than I did before watching it.,0

3482,I loved seeing this movie. Michelle is so down-to-earth. Watching how she came from humble beginnings and was determined to work hard to be the best that she could be was so inspiring. To see that she is still grounded and using her platform to uplift others was also wonderful.,1
3483,"It doesn't give you anything for free, but draws you in and rewards paying attention to the subtleties of the interactions. For me it was a brilliant commentary on 'change' and a perfect film.",1
3484,"Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross may have created a new genre, but this version eventually wears out its welcome.  We have a documentary film that is casted, and at its best it's like any bar in America.  It's a slice of life that has some moments that make you scratch your head until you learn the entire story!  The less you know about this one going in the better, but after you watch it and read all about it.  I'm mixed.  Final Score: 5.7/10",0
3485,"I must have missed something that other people didn't because I honestly feel like I wasted time that I will never regain by watching this.  This movie is a sad depiction of what many do or actually don't do, with their lives.  As they pontificate about the generational stereotypes, their philosophical beliefs fall flat.  What is heart-breaking is that this bar and these regulars have valid meaning to many of their lives, and yet, none of them have genuine care or concern for the other.  Although they spend so much time together, nobody really knows the other.  It is a great example of what NOT to do with your life.",0
3486,"What a wonderful movie! It's not just about gay romance, although that figures importantly, it's a view into a culture we as Americans know so little about, and what a tradition of dance and music.  And yes, it's about breaking out of boundaries in every way: sexual, dance, culture.  Tremendous directing, editing, acting, dancing, music. . . loved it!",1
3487,"Good break from the usual crap they usually show in theaters this time of year. Smart, creative, and visually interesting.",1

I asked myself why drive the old truck at night along perilous unsafe roads ?    Is nighttime better to avoid enemy fire ?   Are the lives of the soldiers who died so worthless ?    Who was in overall command ?  Don't the basic principles of land warfare teach you that he who has the high ground has the advantage ?   I understand the follow orders principle.  But I felt embarrassed by the premise of this film.   Soldiers being placed in such a terrible situation may seem to some as heroic.  I do not.",0
3502,"There are too many reviews speaking from the outside looking in. The crude humor, the emotionless death scenes. This is how soldiers talk and act. They captured a very accurate representation of how soldiers present themselves. Yet, the emotionless death? The majority of the deaths are captured during conflict. There isn't much time to grieve when you could be gone the next second. With how long the film is, I feel they presented a very well formed piece about a very unfortunate battle for the United States Army.",1
3503,"Understandably in simultaneous production akin to ""1917"", but there's a creative length that would've found contributive exception to further the aforementioned's amazing style that evolved the genre's authenticity and experience honorably replicated cinematically.

I wasn't expecting much when I stumbled upon this movie but I was intrigued by the title. It's such a soft but powerful story. It's messy (in every good way). It's beautiful and I am so glad I ended up watching it.",1
3512,"I signed up to watch this movie because it was rated as one of the top ten of Ben Mendelson's roles. I watched it in segments because it was somewhat of a chore. I had not had previous experience with the genre of a teenager's terminal illness nor with a contemporary teenage romance story. These are difficult, complicated topics,  courageous for the creators of the film to embark upon. It would be wrong to blame the film for my lack of appreciation; the cause is more my lack of discrimination. My recent movie fare has been crime dramas, and this film was a departure for me. I have to say, though, that the following morning, I woke up with a revelation by which I understood how a couple of the scenes fit together and this gave an underlying meaning that I hadn't ""gotten"" while watching it. The story must have had an impact, otherwise my mind wouldn't have dwelled on it overnight and put together subtleties I missed. One of the things the movie ""says"" is that in unusual circumstances, a parent should depart from the conventional parenting style to meet the current exigencies.",0
3513,Started a bit slow/weird and i wasnt sure it was going to be for me but got into it more as it progressed and was on board by the end which was strong. Good performances and likeable characters. The timeline jumps were a little confusing but this may have been the aim.,1

3516,"Shannon Murphy's first film and a fresh one. This Aussie film leads us into the life of Milla - a seriously sick teenager. She falls in love with Moses. A messed up guy, but he shows his true, gentle sides when they are together.

This is a very character driven drama. The two main persons here are both weird and really great. Milla's parents are something special and so are the pregnant, smoking neighbor. There are plenty of humor here but it's more on the drama side. Deep and very well produced and paced, with varied, rhythmic scenes and a great score. One of the better films I've seen this year.

8 out of 10 violins.",1
3517,"I loved this film. It follows the classic arc of a coming of age + terminal illness story, but with strong character-driven writing that is both understated and vibrant at the same time. The actors were fantastic and each played to their character's quirks. And even though the story centred on Milla's journey in particular, everyone clicked together perfectly in a solid ensemble. This was a deeply moving film, without being maudlin or cliche. With lots to contemplate as the final credits started to roll.",1

It always felt like there was a really good movie happening just off camera.  It's really a shame because the actors were absolutely fantastic given the story they were telling.",0
3525,Quite slow and old-fashioned plot (at first I thought the film was based on a novel from some decades ago but found that the story was newly written in current time). Felt no motivation and pretty bored.,0

3529,"I watched this movie expecting something that wasn't good and on par with a Lifetime movie on Sunday. I was very wrong. I guess I have a personal connection with this movie, because I'm a ""fallen christian"" myself. The movie takes a lot of stabs at organized religion, and brings up a lot of issues from individuality to church and religious politics, which I absolutely enjoyed. 

For me it really brings to light the controlling aspects of organized religion especially in christianity (don't do anything bad or you're going to hell!).  It also touches heavily on how those in control of the church, and those who come off as ""holier than thou"", do all those things that they say not to do or you'll go to hell. It also brings up some really interesting perspectives on figuring out life, a personal relationship with ""god"", and most importantly..... issues that are between you and whatever (a god, a diety, a higher power whatever), and no one else needs to be involved.

I was expecting some Lifetime movie pro religious movie, and I was pleasantly surprised with a movie that questions everything, addresses lifes issues, and leaves you with that feeling that everything is going to be OK. Give it a watch if you haven't already!",1

3550,"John Lewis was a legend and a hero in the fight for the Civil Rights.  He stated early in the mostly autobiographical documentary feature that ""His biggest fear is waking up one day and seeing the Democracy gone.""  Fake outrage from a man that became quite disingenuous in his later years.   Frankly, his neoliberalism is a large reason for the mess the USA is in.  It would have been one thing to endorse Hillary Clinton in the hotly contested Democratic Primary of 2016, but Lewis also railed on another champion of Civil Rights Bernie Sanders.  That forever tarnished a great man in a way that MUST be talked about.  Will it be in this film by CNN? Not only do they get the later years of his life wrong, but they don't give him enough credit for the early stages of his life and the remarkable hurdles he helped leap.  John Lewis showing his artwork.  UGH.  What a mess.  Final Score:  4.2/10",0
3551,Not very interesting.,0

3553,"An excellent, moving film. It gives us the viewers a crystal clear insight into the late Rep. John Lewis's life through interviews with him, family, friends, staff, and colleagues. It's portrayal of Lewis shows a man with imperfections but of integrity and strength of character and conviction.",1
3554,"This documentary is about the life of John Lewis, congressman and civil rights icon. The film uses interviews (many of them with Lewis as a much older but still committed fighter for civil rights) and archival film and photo sources to tell his story. It is a pretty ""standard"" documentary; there is nothing extraordinary about the filming or the approach. However, it is an inspiring story about a man who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and found himself arrested and sometimes beaten in his fight for civil rights. He became famous for saying that people should get into ""good trouble"". There is a lot of very important history here that still has relevance in 21st century America. We seem to live in a time when people who protest are considered anti-American or are otherwise vilified, but this is a wonderful call to arms that the fight is not anywhere near being over and that we all need to find ways to get into ""good trouble"" and make the change that needs to happen. The stage changes, but the play seems to remain the same. Big thumbs up for a powerful story of a man who devoted his life to making change. I highly recommend this film.",1

3556,"It's been decades since Bloody Sunday, nearly 2 months since protests erupted over George Floyd's death and the fight is still not close to being over. The world lost another truly special soul and hope you will all take a moment to watch this inspirational film and think deeply about how we can honor him by getting into some ""good, necessary trouble.""",1
3557,"A bio-pic of a real American hero.  This film puts John Lewis's life in context, and shows how the struggles of the Civil Rights Era are relevant today (and not in the ways that you'd think).",1
3558,"There is an old African proverb: ""When you pray, you move your feet.""   The proverb resonates powerfully in this quote from John Lewis' memoir, Walking in the Wind: ""As a nation if we care for the beloved community, we must move our feet, our hands, our hearts, our resources to build and not tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill.  In the final analysis, we are one people, one family, one house, the American house, the American family."" 

John Lewis is a powerful writer.  I read  Walking in the Wind several years ago, and it had a  powerful impact on me.  John Lewis: Good Trouble, the documentary, makes that same powerful impact:   It brings his story to life!  As in his memoir, the film reveals the man behind the legend.   

I was moved to tears by the footage from the 1960s.  I was beginning my teenage years back in 1963. Television was still a young medium, and it showed us all that was going on in the world daily.  I was learning about the world and its ways in the ‘60s—the injustices, the fight for dignity, freedom, equality and decency.  These were my middle school years, my high school years, formative years brought back to life as I watched this film. 

History repeats itself until we learn.  John Lewis: Good Trouble follows John Lewis throughout his young life in Alabama, working on his parent's farm, feeding chickens, picking cotton.  Mr. Lewis' narration of waking up early, hiding under the porch to wait for the school bus, running onto the bus to get to school to his wonderful teachers where he says he read everything, is a powerful visual image.  I love what one of his sisters says about John wearing a tie and carrying the Bible to school every day.  John was a serious student.  He wanted more in his life.  Clearly, he wanted to make a difference in our country for racial justice for African American people. His tireless work and dedication started as a college student. From SNCC leader to Congressman from Georgia, John Lewis fought the good fight for voter's rights, for civil rights, for the right to eat at the same restaurant as white people, for integration, not segregation.  His marches, his belief in nonviolence and commitment to the cause have continued for 65 years.

One story that Henry Gates Jr. tells about John Lewis' great-great grandfather getting his voting card back in the 1800s has a powerful twist. So many stories, so much history where he worked so hard from the time of Dr. Martin Luther King to President Barack Obama to now! 

This inspirational documentary is a must see.  John Lewis: Good Trouble weaves an important story about an exceptional man, shows us our history from the ‘60s to today, and demonstrates the part John Lewis played, and continues to play, as the fight for racial justice and equality is at a pivotal moment in time with the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I give John Lewis: Good Trouble 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it for 9 to 18-year-olds to learn about an effective leader and his plight—and to understand even further the times we are currently living through. I also recommend it to adults, to remember all that has transpired through the years, to reflect and act on how we can all move forward once and for all to make the change that is way long overdue.

3559,"3 5 stars; The Irish can make a film so raw, that it is still painful hours after watching it. This movie is a prime example.

The acting was real, too real, such that it made the violence horrific. Yet at the same time, the protagonist evoked feelings of empathy in this sea of violence. 

Cosmo Jarvis does an excellent job as a former boxer who works as an enforcer for a family of drug dealers in rural Ireland,  so as to care for his autistic son. All the moral conflicts in his life cause him to come undone.",1

I thought it was interesting seeing how the young children reacted being around the aggressive people, their parents (primarily the father).

Director Nick Rowland's debut feature serves up a familiar story with a number of intriguing twists that provide an interesting venue for its multidimensional characters, roles that give the picture's excellent ensemble cast much to work with, especially protagonist Cosmo Jarvis and sinister sidekick Barry Keoghan. The picture drags a bit in a few spots, and the actors' thick accents sometimes challenge the viewer's audio comprehension capabilities, but there's much to like in this otherwise-fine offering. In fact, I liked just about everything about this film except its title(s), neither of which suit it particularly well.

This movie takes an unconventional approach to telling the story with some of the former band members telling the story to a live audience. I think it made the movie feel a lot more personal and made it more effective in some of the more emotional moments. I personally only know a few of this group's songs but I am interested to check out more after watching this. Their story is consistently interesting and I genuinely felt like I was seeing the story of three friends play out instead of just a music group, which felt special.

The filmmakers did have bias in the sense of attempting to make you feel bad for the left leaning candidate and painting all the conservatives in a negative light. Am I supposed to be surprised? Disappointed? Motivated? Other than allowing the viewer an inside look at the program, what was the point? ",0
3586,"An interesting documentary on Apple TV+ about 1200 seventeen year olds Texan boys who came to the Boys State event to build a hypothetical government from scratch. 

Now as unique as the plot sound, the story actually reflected a lot about what was happening in modern politics. The boys were separated into two parties, and the voting process was similar to one in the US. The boys discussed a lot about common issues, as well as using political tactics that were seen before. Since this is Texas, many of the boys were conservative and one of the biggest topics was gun control. The speeches made by the boys were also similar to those real life political campaign speeches. 

For me, I dislike politics and cannot stand campaign speeches for how generic they all are. So throughout the movie was usually bored at the issues that the boys discussed, as well as the speeches, except for one. One of them made a very good speech that actually convinced me. 

Toward the end, the movie definitely got better as more drama appeared and things spiced up. That was when the movie got me really hooked up to see who would win as the governor.

The movie tells the story of the largest public school embezzlement in history and does so fairly well.  I do not think ""Bad Education"" is a great movie, but it is worth seeing at least once due to the very good performances by the entire cast.  Hugh Jackman is very good in his Emmy nominated role as Dr. Frank Tassone.  Academy Award winner Allison Janney is also very good as Tassone's partner in crime Pam Gluckin.  The movie does have its problems however.  The story is told in a formulaic manner.  When Roslyn High School student Rachel Kellog starts to suspect wrongdoing in the school district, she is is discouraged from pursuing the story by her peers and school officials.  When that does not work,  Tassone and Gluckin threaten her and then say she could destroy the reputations of good people if she is wrong.  This is something we have seen many times before so I found it rather boring.  Also when the scandal is finally made public we have the scenes of people being lead away in handcuffs and police searching boxes.  Again, nothing we have not seen before.

It's an interesting idea and it made me think of Richard Osman's debut novel 'The Thursday Murder Club', which is about a group of care home residents that investigate crimes (this documentary doesn't focus on a murder though, it must be said). I suppose its true that society maybe hasn't made many films, or otherwise concentrated on, care home residents - what they experience and so on, in the past.

------------------------
Reseña Español

Yoko, una joven reportera japonesa (Atsuko Maeda, actriz y cantante pop) y su equipo recorren Uzbekistán para un programa de viajes de la TV japonesa.

La película de Kishoyi Kurosawa tiene bastante de inclasificable. Es un drama, pero con momentos de comedia, algunos de ellos perturbadores, con Yoko pasando por varias situaciones incómodas y a veces insólitas. Hasta los confines… es una película impredecible que sorprende a cada rato con los avatares de su protagonista, con sus consiguientes y necesarios cambios de registro. A pesar de ello, la película conserva su coherencia de principio a fin, en parte por la figura de su protagonista, frágil pero curiosa y resuelta.

Ciertos choques culturales, las diferencias de criterio con su equipo, su férreo y tenaz profesionalismo, las vocaciones postergadas y los sueños de Yoko se suman a un registro casi documental de las exóticas locaciones por las que transitan que nunca cae en el pintoresquismo.
---------------------------
English Review
Yoko, a young Japanese reporter (Atsuko Maeda, actress and pop singer) and her team travel to Uzbekistan for a Japanese TV travel program.

Kishoyi Kurosawa's film is quite unclassifiable. It's a drama, but with moments of comedy, some of them disturbing, with Yoko going through various awkward and sometimes unusual situations. Up to the End ... is an unpredictable film that surprises at all times with the vicissitudes of the protagonist of it, with the consequent and necessary changes of registry of her. Despite this, the film retains its coherence from beginning to end, in part because of the figure of her protagonist, fragile but curious and determined.

Certain cultural clashes, the differences of opinion with her team, her iron and tenacious professionalism, the postponed vocations and Yoko's dreams add to an almost documentary record of the exotic locations through which they pass that never falls into the picturesqueness.",1
3621,"Take one part character study, one part campy comedy (although that may have been unintentional) and a whole vat full of schmaltz and you've got one searing mess of a movie. This Japanese offering about a clueless TV reporter for a cheesy travel show doing segments about life in Uzbekistan has more changes of mood and plot than Baskin-Robbins has flavors. Between her uncanny knack for perpetually failing at her work and finding herself in the wrong parts of town, a compelling but largely inexplicable urge to free a penned-up goat, her seemingly underwhelming romantic feelings for her boyfriend back home (except when it really counts), and an underdeveloped (and somewhat indifferent) attitude toward wanting to fulfill her ambition of becoming a singer, you've got dear, sweet, shrill, naive Yoko (Atsuko Maeda), who has no meaningful or apparent direction in her life (even though she always seems to feel the need to fearfully run wherever it is she's trying to go at the moment). It's pure, unadulterated ambling from start to finish. If anyone can tell me what director Kiyoshi Kurosawa was going for here, please explain it to me.",0
3622,"Sometimes you just have to chalk it down to: I just don't get it and move on. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's 2019 film, now streaming on MUBI, would have passed me by if not for the favourable reviews it has received; and even though I don't consider it a bad film or a badly made one, I did find it oddly composed, truncated and a tad pretentious. Atsudo Maeda, a member of a highly successful J-pop girl-band in real life, plays a timid, fish-out-of-water reporter, who dreams of being a singer, but instead finds herself many miles away from home in Uzbekistan filming a travel program. Confronted and challenged by culture shock and language barriers, she is further humiliated and exploited by her production team led by an indifferent director. Made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relationship between Uzbekistan and Japan, the locals are decently depicted, as expected, and it might be of some interest as a travelogue film. Otherwise, the mix of mild comedy and twee drama (involving her getting lost, twice! and getting into trouble with the police while chasing a cat!), and her Japanese cover of Edith Piaf's Hymne a l'Amour, is simply baffling and lost on me. So instead, I'll return to two of those reviews that got me here: Mark Schilling of The Japan Times called Madea a ""lonely-but-intrepid heroine"" – but I think she's more insipid than intrepid; while Hollywood Reporter's Neil Young wrote, ""Officially endorsed international co-productions are usually stilted, self-consciously didactic affairs; the seasoned but adventurous hands of Kurosawa, however, here yield quietly immersive and spellbinding results."" – of which I can wholeheartedly endorse the first half, but I've detected no evidence of the second.",0
3623,"A little bit slow, but a beautiful story",1
3624,"I really can't see a flaw right here. The acting, skilled directing, cinematography and the story itself make a great and compelling portrait of grief and history.",1
3625,"Absolutely beautiful cinematography and an engaging, heartbreaking story.",1
3626,"A striking, powerful and skillful directorial debut from Melina León, that with excellent performances, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, claustrophobic and haunting atmosphere, melancholic soundtrack and an emotionally affecting narrative, it serves as a sad, thought-provoking, heartbreaking, disturbing, evocative and gritty exploration of one of the darkest chapters in Peruvian history.",1
3627,"This fact-based but atmospheric tale of the efforts of a young mother and a closeted journalist to uncover an infant selling ring in Peru during the country's political turmoil of the 1980s provides a unique take on a shocking news story told from a highly personal, exceedingly inventive perspective. With an excellent lead performance by Pamela Mendoza, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and an ethereal original score, director Melina Leon's debut feature tells a captivating story all its own while simultaneously paying homage to Latin American political thrillers (most notably Chilean-based offerings like ""Missing"" and ""Spider""), as well as tales of minority disenfranchisement and exploitation (such as Mexico's ""Roma""). Admittedly, the film could use a little more back story for context, and it sometimes tries to do a little too much, with some story threads not fleshed out as thoroughly as they could be. Overall, though, this is a fine initial offering from another promising new talent, a filmmaker who clearly demonstrates a great deal of vision and imagination in telling a story that could have easily been presented much more conventionally in lesser skilled hands.",1
3628,"The black and white camera work captures the story in a powerful way, depicting the time and place with incredible artistry.",1
3629,One sorrowful and thought provoking drama about illegal immigration and survival of those searching for a better life.,1
3630,Honestly a really good movie. It subverted the genre which was a refreshing touch. I definitely would watch this movie again.,1
3631,I've watched this movie as many times as Niles was rebooted.,1
3632,"Fresh, funny. A light-hearted comedy that gets you thinking.",1
3633,Amazing premise! Funny and totally original 💜,1
3634,Amaze balls love me a mind bender,1
3635,"Witty, original and engrossing, it's an engrossing film full of surprises. Lead by the brilliant Adam Samberg and Cristin Milioti, it's a must watch. Superb",1
3636,"50 first date in quantum physics, nice",1
3637,"Typical, and somewhat predictable movie. But the leads had much chemistry between them, I ended up loving it. Lighthearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. And in my book, that is indeed an awesome recipe.",1
3638,"Goats are so funny to me, I love that the first shot is that of a goat. It seems like Samberg's character isn't attracted to his girlfriend anymore, probably because she's so superficial and fake. Andy's comedic delivery is so good. I love his wedding speech. There's this oddly charming tone to the movie that I can't put my finger on. That familiar feeling to how things and people are connected in life in unexplainable ways. What the hell is going on? Is this movie based on greek mythology or some fantasy story? It's definitely interesting. It must feel so weird and out of body to be reliving the same day, kind of like ‘Groundhog Day'. Omg it's so chaotic lol but I love it. It's pretty dark how Nyles showed Roy the cave and now Roy is a part of this never ending loop.

I think I know how the movie's going to go. I think the only way to break the loop is for Nyles and Sarah to fall in love with one another because they're meant to be or something like that. That's my theory. I love how they start messing around and having fun with the fact that they can do whatever they want without any repercussions. This whole time I was wondering who the guy in the shower was in Sarah's room and when they did the reveal, my jaw dropped and I screamed out loud. I couldn't even believe it, I was not expecting that. What a crazy curveball! This opens up a whole new can of worms. That's incredible how they did that.

Sarah slept with her sisters fiancé the night before the wedding. Now I understand why she hates herself. Ok, this just got super mega interesting lol. Sarah's trying to run away from the terrible decision she's made. It's kind of a metaphor for dealing with your problems and not running away from them. Confronting the darkness, finding the light and becoming a better person. Not living in denial. Also not harboring dark secrets from the person you care about most. Ok so based on the ending, I think Nana, the old lady, is stuck in the time loop given the things she said to both Nyles at the beginning and Sarah at the end. It seems Sarah and Nyles both made it out of the time loop but Roy is still stuck. It seems like a dark way to end it, but given that Sarah called Roy telling him about her plan to get out, it's more of a hopeful and happy ending as Roy gets to decide when he wants to leave. Now the real question is, will Roy choose to escape the time loop or has he become comfortable with his present life? Only time will tell I guess.

It's a genuinely funny movie that's clever, witty and quirky. It's a pretty dark and disorienting concept and premise but the way they filmed it with comedy and intrigue makes for a totally original and entertaining experience. There's great character development throughout. The movie is a wonderful homage to 80's comedies movies, and I love that. They even got 80's inspired synths and drum sounds for the soundtrack. And I actually liked Andy Samberg in this movie. His face didn't annoy me lol. Cristin Milioti, Sarah, also did a fantastic job, she's got great comedic chops. The movie poses an intriguing what if question. This is a movie I'd definitely want to revisit and watch again. There's deeper layers to this movie that I'd like to uncover. Overall, I loved it. I thought it was very fun. It's a great twist on romantic comedies - adding an extra layer of Sci-fi and making it that much more intriguing. I didn't think much of the movie going into it, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting and fresh it felt. Definitely thought provoking and definitely entertaining. Totally worth the watch.",1
3639,"Groundhog Day may have introduced the concept, but Palm Springs perfected it.",1
3640,what a beautiful way to tell the story of the lion king through modern music,1
3641,"Sublime. Maravilhosa a maneira com que se exalta a cultura negra, a mistura de arte visual e boa música, é impossível de não gostar.",1
3642,Beyoncé and the film are mesmerizing.,1
3643,"This feature length film, a visual album by Beyonce, uses her music and the medium to retell the story of the Lion King from the perspective of the Black experience. The film is impressive and showcases Beyonce's incredible talent and vision. Filming took place in Africa, Europe, and the US and features a lot of unknown actors. The visual imagery stunning, some of the images with their juxtaposition of color and sound are breathtaking. The costuming is equally gorgeous and reflects the many aspects of the African and African American experiences. The film is a celebration of Black pride, Black beauty, Black history, and Black culture that should set the standard for how filmmakers can achieve diversity and inclusion and turn out superior works of art. The film feels like a series of music videos in some places, but Beyonce uses her unique voice and poetry to stitch the episodes together into a coherent story. I am amazed at what she accomplishes here. Big thumbs up from me.",1
3644,This defiantly reminded me why being black is being beautiful.,1
3645,"After watching this film, it gave me peace of mind and raised my self-esteem in every possible way. thank you beyoncé. #BlackLivesMetter",1
3646,"This one I watched within the scope of my personal goal to watch from time to time something completely different from my usual range of interest (never were interested in Beyoncé's music). And for the visual style of it, I admit. And while I was not by any means disappointed by the latter, I had some problem with the way ""Black is King"" approaches the topic of Dinsney's "" The Lion King""; more precisely, how it tries to reclaim it for black people. I was saddened to discover that it refers to it not by subtle similarities, which I expected it to do, but by straightforward and, to be hones, rather blunt recall of some of its most memorable quotes one to one. This, in turn, rearranged in my mind the extent of this attempt of said reclaiming. Quickly I became critical of how this movie relies not on intellectual concept but vague mystical symbolism and, in the end, the only effort that it makes regarding ""The Lion King"" is telling quasi-similar story (stories?) about a black boy, which it then uses to convince us to simply accept that lion is black is king. And there I was, expecting it to incorporate to that story enriching thought rather than plain rich symbolism...",1
3647,"I didn't always understand how it connected with the Lion King.  I watched it on Disney plus and description said it was made by her for young kings and queens based on lessons from the Lion King.  Didn't make the connection. There was a segment that came off creepy demonic in the imagery mid-beginning...my young daughter was like...what is that suppose to be, that's creepy?!  I really like the segment near the end...the women dancing, it was very powerful and empowering.",0
3648,It was ok....basically a long music video.  I did enjoy parts of it.,0
3649,"Not sure what I just watched.

A lot of different themes going on here.

So its really an adaptation of ""The Lion King"" or a Beyonce visual album?

Liked the imagery but all in all its a stinker.",0
3650,"Well done. Great story line, deep characters. Ignore the goofballs talking about who should play these roles. 

A value-less theme of ""sex is the goal to happiness"" but still a warm and optimistic story",1
3651,"Funny, moving, it opened my eyes to things I hadn't thought about before.",1
3652,Wonderfully adapted and elevated by the performances of its actors. Brilliant lessons of humanity. 9/10,1
3653,sooo good. man. i wont soon forget this hidden gem.,1
3654,"This gentle drama-comedy is the kind of film I normally catch up with in-flight when we can travel by planes. Essentially a road movie crossed with a teen comedy, except they aren't teenagers (the oldest, in fact, is in his thirties here) but two guys in wheelchairs and a third who's blind who have decided to lose their virginities at a special brothel that caters for guys like them. Richard Wong's film is a remake of a Belgian movie which in turn was inspired by the real story of Asta Philpot, and you can see the struggle on screen where real events invoking natural emotional reactions sit not entirely comfortably next to fictionalized elements from which dramatic tensions and comedic potentials are mined. It's a good thing that Erik Linthorst's script generally keeps sentimentality in check and the film moves things along in a mostly sensitive and brisk manner. Sometimes, too briskly, as if scenes are missing, for example, in establishing how Grant Rosenmeyer's Scotty and Hayden Szeto's Matt go suddenly from strangers to best mates. Luckily, the cast is likeable, and at this point, I'm inclined to be more forgiving, for a small budgeted indie like this, about casting able-bodied actors in the main roles. However, I'm less forgiving about Matt's conveniently unnamed condition which was never explained properly so that it can act as the excuse for more than a few narrative surprises that create emotional and poignant dramatic moments I'm not sure the film has properly earned. While it does have its heart in the right place, it couldn't help tripping over itself by trying too hard to add pathos to what's really just a sweet little film about one of the most normal thing in the world: trying to get laid.",0
3655,"You would not think first that it is a pass!
But after watching you will totally be impressed and satisfied!
Awesome",1
3656,"This is one of the most ableist movies I have ever seen. First, the main characters are played by able-bodied actors, so every time they use words like cri*ple, it just feels wrong. Second, it emphasizes the idea that disabled people are inherently undesirable and completely defined by their disability. In addition, it just wasn't a well done movie. A lot of the plot lines did not make sense and it completely objectified women, while playing on the ""mammy"" trope as well. The only reason this gets two stars is because a lot of the jokes were funny and I was entertained at points. All around, super offensive and I'm shocked that there has not been more outrage about this movie. I could go on and on about the insensitivity of this film, but basically, it infantilizes people with disabilities and should not be promoted.",0
3657,A heart warming and funny movie.  I really enjoyed it.,1
3658,This was ten times better than I thought it would be.  I got totally sucked in and was laughing my ass off.  You should check it out!,1

3660,"BROWN RAP
Anothe Riz Ahmed project dealing with the possible derailment of a music career due to a health issue? Yes, and this may be Oscar nomination number two for the young upstar(t). ""Mogul Mowgli"" does an excellent job of setting up the trending career of British born to Pakistani parents rapper Zed - easy since it parallels the real life of actor, writer, rapper Ahmed (Riz MC to you), but it is the physical and mental torment that ensues with a family visit that is the real pulse in the film.

Attacked by his more traditional circle who find it hard to recognize the high flying rapper, and attacked by his body's immune system because it cannot recognize itself, Zed the rapper and Zaheer the son sees his rosy world come crashing to a violent halt in a double whammy of identity theft.

During a frantic hospital stay on the eve of a major tour, an unsettling past haunts a desperate Zaheer in a series of hallucinatory sequences as he searches for his mind and his body. The historical context, left unexplained except for a few cloudy clues, refers to the 1947 Pakistani and Indian partition, more specifically the short story ""Toba Tek Singh"" that deals with the repercussions of creating a border and shuffling people based on religious lines. Oh those crazy Brits.

Identity is a complex struggle Zaheer is forced to reconcile as his life crumbles, and he is literally and figuratively stuck in no man's land. Borderless.

Slickly edited, from flashy concert scenes to humble immigrant apartment life, ""Mogul Mowgli"" flows freely from English to Urdu in a wonderful rhythm, especially poignant when father and son move from stilted social niceties to butting stubborn heads. All of this heaviness boils down to the Riz Ahmed and Ally Khan show, and a damn fine show it is.

- hipCRANK",1
3661,A solid performance by Riz Ahmed with a story with unlimited potential that is lazy and in need of a major rewrite. A five star performance. A 2 1/2 star direction  and 2 1/2 star story that drags often.,0
3662,"Riz Ahmed elevates a film that was merely pedestrian to somewhat entertaining. Ahmed, who co-wrote, can't make up for the lack of words on the page, but does his best with a nuanced performance with all the facial expressions he had in his arsenal.  Besides Ahmed's genius, this is a slog at times, with things happening too quickly at times and repetitive at others.  When the film reaches the fantasy it took me out of the movie.  Worth watching, but a definite mixed bag.  Final Score: 6/10",0
3663,"Riz continues to shine. This film is deep. Dark. And a wonderful showcase for the continued evolution of Riz's incredible ability to shape-shift into the characters he portrays. Not a perfect film, but perfect for what it is. Intense. Bold. Brave.",1
3664,"nice flick, original",1
3665,"After seeing him in ""Sound of Metal"" and here, he's almost the same character: intense musician facing a health crisis. Here it's superimposed on his ethnic and religious background and his life choices diverging from them. He's great, different than the drummer guy but the same, and the movie is effective at conveying the pressure and emotion of the contradictions of being British born but not seen as British. I wish it had gone further and really explored the heritage and faith issues rather than just fast cuts and flashbacks. It also deserves a better conclusion, we see promise but no fulfillment. A well done movie overall, I look forward to the director's next and hopefully more mature work.",1
3666,Yum n       Ivory yhu hi I’m,1

This shows you a side of a south-asian British born in a house with south Asian culture - we see the clash from ""what I like"" to ""what my culture wants"". It show that we are put in a box from our own people, and from the people outside. Its a masterpiece. I don't want to spend all day on rotten tomato explaining how I felt. I think you would love the movie if you felt racism, or has some anger that we are told to stay in our lane, that ""we"" should go back to our county.",1
3669,"I saw this because my wife, who is from Pakistan, wanted to see it. She was very dissapointed. The film itself is extremely pretentious and disjointed and the acting is self concious. We had the highest hopes for this but it was difficult to make it through the entire film.",0
3670,"At first, it was slow and a bit confusing on what is happening, but I think maybe it is building characters and the relationship between two main characters, and in the end, I don't really want it to end. It is a combination of sweet, comedy, and sadness. It is not a kind of movie that you will watch it again and again, but the ""Friendship"" message does really hit you. It does not miss and go in vain.

However, when it's dark, it is much darker than any horror movies I've seen. You can't really see what's happening. (And extra points from me: John Magaro's voice in this movie is so smooth and even hypnotic, Lol)",1
3671,"This is a slow, thoughtful, contemplative perhaps, film. Its quite relaxing in its both rural setting and the instrumental, sometimes banjo or other percussion instruments, music played lightly/sparingly in the background. It's quite quiet, dialogue wise but that's not a bad thing I felt. I enjoyed the cinematography - I like that its understated. Laidback is a term I'd definitely use to describe this film. I suppose its a nice depiction of male companionship to an extent and it highlights a form of isolation that the two main characters no doubt feel regardless. 

I thought the two main characters were well portrayed by John Magaro as Cookie and Orion Lee as King-Lu - I didn't really recognise anyone other than Toby Jones, who seems a nice enough guy at first (he plays the 'chief factor', who is unnamed). I'd say there is a bit of a moral aspect to it. Its not a film for people who like constant action and are hoping for a high octane type Western film but I would say its pretty atmospheric never the less and I definitely enjoyed it overall, very much so. By the end of the film, I felt myself hoping for the best for the two main characters, who are outcasts of sorts. Yes, I'd recommend this film, definitely.",1

3675,Sweet and simple. Overall a nice one time watch. Can be a bit slow at the beginning but it's nice to see how the story plays out.,1
3676,"A story about two outcasts who find friendship and a business partnership with each other in the American frontier.

John Magaro plays a gentle baker who begins the movie as cook for a prospecting expedition. He's too thoughtful and sensitive to really fit in with the macho wild men he's with, who bully and threaten him. Orion Lee is a Chinese immigrant who befriends him and suggests that they go into business selling the baker's biscuits at a local trading post. The biscuits are a sensation, but the enterprise is a dangerous one -- the only place to get milk is to steal it from the cow (yes, THE cow, not A cow) that belongs to the local aristocrat, played by the always welcome Toby Jones. The film begins in the present day with a hiker in the woods discovering something that hints at how the movie will end, and how the movie then circles back to that find is a small miracle of narrative storytelling.

Kelly Reichardt, who's made a career of quiet, understated films, remains true to form here. ""First Cow"" shows much more than it tells, which should please fans of art house fare but will probably frustrate more casual moviegoers who have less patience for the way stories are told. The two main characters don't talk much, but we learn much about them, not from what they say, but from how they act. The first time we see Magaro's character, for example, he's hunting for mushrooms in the woods, and he takes the time to set a salamander he finds back on its feet when it's struggling to flip itself over. And when Lee's character shows him to his cabin in the woods, the first thing Magaro does is find some wildflowers with which to decorate the small space. Little flourishes like these reward the patient viewer, and we come to like the two men so much that the end, though we've been warned of it in advance, feels that much more tragic when it comes.",1

3695,One word to describe this: INCREDIBLE.,1
3696,Brilliant & unguarded doc on an essential Irish poet. This is a pretty great place to start if you aren't too aware of Shane. But Johnny Depp & his fake accent once again wear out their welcome when the only truthful human is the one the documentary is about.,1

3699,A great movie about a great man. Shane is Faffe 🍺👍🏼,1
3700,"A story I knew very little about, 'Red Penguins' covers a lot of ground in a fast-paced way which in the process illustrates the complicated relationship between USSR/Russia and the United States.  It's a Gabe Polsky film and that means it's going to be great.  Polsky played college hockey in the US, grew up in Chicago, but is Russian.  His film, 'Red Army' is worth seeking out and so is this!  Did you know there were American who owned a NHL team who got mixed up in Russian hockey?  The result is this fantastic feature doc.  Final Score: 8.7/10",1
3701,Very interesting story. Fascinating piece of history about sports in Russia.,1
3702,"The sports documentary Red Penguins starts off as a fun, so-crazy-you-can't-believe-it tale of larger-than-life characters mucking it up in post-Soviet Russia and having a ball without oversight. It begins slight and light, though entertaining, briskly jumping from bizarre anecdote after anecdote of the Russian hockey club that was controlled by the Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group (and co-owner Michael J. Fox). Steven Warshaw was a young, extroverted go-getter and tasked with overseeing the American-Russian operation and he was a natural salesman and born showman, using events like free beer and strippers on the ice to build a popular following with the Moscow fandom. At one point, Michael Eisner and Disney were highly interested in getting involved with all of the possibilities of the larger Disney empire. The first half of the movie is zipping from crazy stories about how wild the Penguins could get, at one point having circus bears perform on the ice. However, the movie transforms into something darker, more meaningful, and very ominous that explores how the Russia of today became what it is in the wake of chaos following the Soviet dissolution. In the early 1990s, millions were adjusting to abrupt free-market capitalism with no thoughtful transition from 80 yeas of life under communism. The police forces were ineffective when present, the food lines grew longer over scraps, and many were grappling with what to do next. The country wasn't ready and in the ensuing chaos the system of authority shifted from the state to the mob. The Russian mafia became the banks for millions, including those within the government, and their influence seeped into politics and established an echelon of entrenched oligarchs. The good times of the Penguins got much more serious when their success drew the attention of criminal elements wanting in on the profits. Multiple people attached to the team and assembled media were murdered, and the Americans realized it was time to cut ties and get out. The film by writer/director Gabe Polsky serves as an almost sequel to his 2014 Red Army documenting the decades of dominance from Soviet hockey players. His interview subjects can provide colorful details with the anecdotes, but when the film makes its tonal evolution, those same red-faced, churlish Russians take on a more distressing stance. They justify the rampant graft, corruption, and violence in a flippant ""that's the cost of doing business"" sort of fatalistic moralizing. It's an intriguing process to see the dark contours of interview subjects who beforehand had been portrayed an amiable oddballs. Red Penguins is a cut above the average ESPN 30 For 30 sports documentary when it reaches beyond the crazy headlines to address the costs of runaway good times and how one rowdy hockey team could serve as a symbol for an entire country's descent.

3703,KOYAANISATSI on Ice!,1
3704,"This is a beautiful film. Wonderfully acted, convincing and heart felt. A sheer joy",1
3705,"Delightful performances, compelling story but the ending felt flat, out of synch and underdeveloped. Otherwise 87 minutes of terrific moviemaking and then five final minutes of headscratching.",1
3706,"My new favorite movie!! Though I may be a bit biased as a teen lesbian myself, I found ""Dating Amber"" to be a fresh and breathtaking story that I'd never seen before on screen. Finn O'Shea is more than believable as Eddy and his internal battles are enough to make even the hardest heart begin to beat faster, and contrasts the gorgeous and spunky Lola Petticrew perfectly. Despite her endearingly slightly stereotyped exterior of hair-dyed oddball, the character inside is so uniquely genuine and moraled that she is near-impossible not to love. Though the film showcases a coming out story, it diverts from the typical lengthened parental struggle with sexuality to an unconditional caring by imperfect parents too rarely shown on TV. the characters are far from perfect, but all irreverently funny and most lovable nonetheless, many scenes don't seem to take themselves too seriously but nevertheless feel impactful and painstakingly paced. Even halfway through I could tell that this was a film that got me more than any ever had, and though it's not for everybody perhaps, it's simply breathtaking to me.",1
3707,"Watch it for the leads. The drama may leave you a little cold. The conclusion is a tad muddled. But the two bright, young headliners more than make up for it.",1
3708,Thought this movie was cute as it dealt with heavy issues.,1
3709,"Dry; sometimes dark; occasionally twisted, this is brilliant. Love this style of comedy, and this approach to coming-of-age movies. The characters are brilliant, and the story - though typical of the genre, delivers some great moments",1
3710,"Dating Amber is an upbeat throwback to an era with a true underground  (punk rock, zines, purple hair) and a dark mainstream (rampant and openly acceptable homophobia and misogyny).  Amber embraces the former and is willing to accept she is attracted to women. Meanwhile, societal pressures of manhood and Eddie's own guilt and fear  essentially send Eddie into a painful denial. The two decide to date, which, for Amber provides a chance to bide her time until she can escape to her punk rock underworld. But, for Eddie, it's a chance to actually become society's definition of normal. Needless to say, there are some bumps on this road. But the duo's journey to self actualization is humbling and in fact quite appropriate for today's audiences.",1
3711,Good coming of age movie. I like how the focus leans more towards the internal battle of acceptance / coming out rather than external struggles.,1

3717,"This is a decent documentary about a crazy theme park. The film paints it as a time of two opposites - danger and freedom. I think the safety of guests on rides clearly supersedes the idea of not 'holding their hand', especially on some of the less forgiving sections of the park. So an attempt to make the story about more than a poorly managed, dangerous park misses the mark for me.",1
3718,Absolutely superb! Bit of a nostalgia fest too.,1
3719,Class Action Park is an engaging documentary look at an amusement park we wouldn't see nowadays.Talking heads affectionately take a nostalgic trip to their youth. It's all fun and games until lives are lost. A class doc.,1

3723,"Could be condensed a bit, otherwise it's a pretty solid documentary.",1
3724,A must watch for any Bee Gees fan.,1
3725,"It's some warts, but overall it is a mostly rosy look back at the greatness and brilliance of the Bee Gees through the eyes of the last Gibb brother and several modern day musicians who were influenced by the art of the over 1000 songs that have come from the mind of the Bee Gees either for themselves or many others.  It's the soundtrack of many lives and it should leave you with a smile.  Sprinkled in are other band members through the years, spouses and archived interviews with the two Bee Gees no longer with us.  If you're a fan of music or the group, it's a must-see film!  Final Score: 9/10",1
3726,"Career spanning documentary about The Bee Gees, who, in the late seventies were arguably the biggest band in the world and just a scant few years later, their career took a strange turn when anti disco movements halted their career as a group. 
Really fascinating documentary from their start in Australia to being signed and dealing with fame after their first number one hit.  Great interviews with the band themselves as well as family, former band mates, Eric Clapton and so many more.  
Very comprehensive and engaging.",1
3727,"Authentic, riveting, brilliant, poignant.
Lots of heart. The stories behind your favorite Bee Gee's songs are fascinating.
Their story is incredible. A must-see, even for 'tepid' fans.",1
3728,"I enjoyed this documentary up until the death of disco segment. What really detracted from this documentary was when the security guard who was at the disco sucks rally tells us that most of the disco records being destroyed were actually….R&B records, so therefore the disco sucks rally was really a racist , homophobic rally. So, a security guard gets to set the narrative for this period in time because according to him there were far too many R&B records being destroyed. Out of all the editing cuts that were made to this documentary this made the cut? Disco died out because it had a long successful run and it burned out like all genre's of music eventually do. Music with synthesizers in the 80s died out, hair band music in the 80s died out, grunge music of the 90s died out, and on and on. The producers detracted from a solid tribute to The Bee Gees because they had to slip in their SJW narrative with ""Joe the security guards"" expert analysis.",0
3729,This Films Music will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is basically all about the group and the genre they created. Not much on the Drugs and Drinking or any of their personal life’s beyond the music. I could have lived without the Disco is Dead 30 minute interruption towards the end. Yes it was necessary but not for 30 minutes. FANTASTIC FILM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Their Music and Words will live forever. ,1
3730,Great for every Bee Gees fan out there.,1
3731,The Bee Gees: How Can You Men a Broken Heart is an excellent documentary. It is about the history of the Bee Gees. The Bee Gees give amazing performances. The script is well written. Frank Marshall did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the music. The Bee Gees: How Can You Men a Broken Heart is a must see.,1
3732,"""The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,"" the music documentary directed by Frank Marshall about Iconic band The Bee Gees, shines when sharing so much of the brilliant and successful music of The Brothers Gibb, much of the film narrated by the sole survivor of the band, lead singer and songwriter Barry Gibb, proving that their music is truly timeless. But, I found the film faltered by not diving deeper into the struggles of the band, including only a brief spot focusing on their early breakup, no mention of Bee Gees starring in the 1978 Robert Stigwood produced, failed musical film, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" and short on the brothers various struggles over the years with addictions, leading to the losses of brothers Andy (1988), Maurice (2003) and Robin (2012), briefly focused in the film. I didn't really feel like I learned anything new about The Brothers Gibb from the documentary that I didn't already know. Still, the documentary thrives by including all the iconic, great music and I especially enjoyed what director Frank Marshall shared on The Bee Gees early Miami years, Criteria Recording Studios and the Gibb Brothers tremendous contribution to the Miami Sound and the Disco Era.",1
3733,"HBO ran this yesterday on the 9th anniversary of Robin's passing. I loved his voice, but he had a lot of issues, to be kind. May he rest in peace. I enjoyed learning more about the studio aspect of their music, but this was yet another story that scraped the surface of their relationship as brothers and as individuals. Not much new to be learned by longtime fans.",1
3734,"Making a film about an unclassifiable genius with a gargantuan catalogue of work and numerous other interests surely is no easy feat. ""Zappa"" does a fairly good job at presenting highlights of Frank Zappa's life and career and imparting some nuggets of his philosophy, and, perhaps most importantly, is boosted considerably by the use of precious archive footage from the Zappa Vault, including self-referential narrations by the man himself. A very good doc for the initiated and uninitiated alike.",1
3735,"I loved Zappa and saw him perform several times. This was a very interesting documentary and it was nice to hear interviews with past band members, family, friends and colleagues.",1
3736,"This documentary serves as an interesting overview of a highly respected and iconic American musical original. Frank Zappa was too popular a performer  to be a cult figure, but his music, and the man himself, were too difficult and non- conforming to allow him to ever achieve a mass audience. That said, he offered thrilling peaks of musical beauty and incredible guitar skills as well some inconsistent and sometimes  puerile and juvenile original material. 

Alas, in covering the highlights of Zappas busy musical career and apparently satisfying family life, the movie gives virtually no examples of his extraordinary and often spellbinding guitar playing, beyond a few very brief video snippets and the closing credits soundtrack. The man's playing was thrilling, masterful and highly original, but you'd never know it from this movie. 

Still, an overdue introduction for new audiences to a worthy musical and cultural original with far more substance and lasting value than most of his more far more monetarily successful rock music peers. I do wish he'd had 1/20th the popular recognition of such empty calorie acts such as the Eagles. But then that's hardly what Frank Zappa was aiming for.",1
3737,"Documentary chronicling the early life and career of musician Frank Zappa, who's distinct sound and creativity was unlike anything anyone was doing.  Fascinating footage combined with archival interviews and recent interviews with former band members as well as his wife Gail, paint a compelling picture of the man and composer, much of whiting knew nothing about.  Really great film directed by Alex Winter.",1
3738,"Authorized biographical documentary profits from getting access to the Zappa vaults with lots of previously unseen footage; furthermore, it is intelligently made, presents a good overview over Zappa's music and art, and still avoids adulation.",1
3739,"Although I am might not be the biggest Zappa lover out there, I did enjoy this journy in the man's life and mind.",1
3740,"nice back stories for Frank in recognition of his take on art. Out there, sure. But, damn, was he unique.  Dedicated. Passionate. Yeah, good shit.",1
3741,"I'm a sucker for documentaries about artists, particularly musicians.  Learning about the creative process & execution will always be fascinating to me as a percussionist who has an understanding of the struggles and technical execution necessary for truly great artists capable of expression themselves.  I wouldn't necessarily call myself a Frank Zappa fan, but his unique voice and exceptional talent, coupled with high intelligence and courage to do and say whatever he wanted, is one that I've long admired, even when I didn't necessarily ""get"" what he was trying to say.  I suspect director Alex Winter is in the same boat, as he's curated a wonderful portrait of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century in a way that seems to truly revere the artist without fawning over him in a fan-boy way.  Winter doesn't seem interested in over-explaining Zappa's muse or creative process, for the most part; nor does Winter dig deep for controversy or family & band dramas.  ZAPPA is more an exploration of the artist, told primarily via archival interview footage: often coming straight from Frank Zappa's own mouth!

Winter interviews Zappa's widow, Gail, as well as a handful of band members from various eras to paint the picture of what it was like being around Frank: how intensely demanding he was to work with in he striving for his bandmates to execute his ideas as perfectly as he could. I appreciate that Winter is honest with his portrayal of Frank, with talk about how Frank was not around much when his kids were growing up.  Zappa always came across in interviews as honest (down to his bluntness of fooling around with groupies on tour, getting VD, having it treated and moving on), and Winter affords Frank the same honesty here.  Musicians that recorded and/or toured with Zappa's Mothers of Invention band are some of the legit best in the business; here they sometimes talk about how they sometimes couldn't keep up with Frank's ideas.  As a musician who admires many of these luminaries of the industry, some of them boarding on adoration (drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, who recorded & toured with Zappa in the late 70's-early/mid-80's, is absolutely a musical drumming god amongst the rest of us mere mortals) I'm almost taken aback hearing some of them (like Steve Vai) flat-out talk about how they were at times not good enough.  While that kind of blows my mind, it's a testament to Zappa's ingenuity and talents as both a composer and guitar player.

ZAPPA takes us through Frank's life in a way that feels like it hits all the highlights.  Winter had access to Zappa's archival vault, something no other filmmaker had been able to do; that gives us TONS of awesome homemade films Zappa made: not just home movies, but other fictional endeavors that Frank worked on before his music career blossomed.  Even as someone who's not in love with Zappa's body of work I found PLENTY to keep me both interested and in awe.  ZAPPA does a great job of also showcasing Frank's diplomatic work (being a sort-of diplomat when Czech Republic tore away from communism into a free country) as well as he being a strong advocate for Freedom of Speech and Assembly as they pertain to music.  Zappa advocated free speech and defended artists like Prince and Bruce Springsteen (amongst MANY others) when those artists kept quiet.  Frank even bluntly explained it was their right to keep their mouths shut and not protest and he had zero problems fighting for their lyrics when they wouldn't.

This is a really wonderful documentary; if you every wrote-off Zappa as just another weirdo-type, give this a watch and get to know the artist behind the ""weird"" music.",1
3742,"The biographical documentary ""Zappa"", directed by Alex Winter was totally worth the two plus hours.  It includes previously unreleased footage from Zappa's personal vault, to which Winter was granted access by the Frank Zappa Family Trust.  Essentially all I knew about Zappa were the  unique names for two of his four kids.  He's a fascinating man who isn't always shown in a favorable light which makes this refreshing considering some of the other bio-docs we've had to go through lately.  Music lovers will be in their wheelhouse.  Final Score: 8/10",1
3743,"I knew little to nothing about Frank Zappa going in and now I don't know if anything has ever re-contextualized the music industry, especially in the 60's, like this Alex Winter-directed doc. 

Seemingly captures the genuine essence of a guy who was near impossible to pin down.

Would love to write more about this film and Zappa himself after digging more into the man's life and work as well re-visiting the film again afterward.",1
3744,"Again one of those movies where I don't quite get the high number of positive critics reviews. I found this movie immensely annoying at times. It's really hard to root for a protagonist that is basically portrayed as the stupidest character in the history of cinema. Bethany Anne Lind is awesome in the role but the character acts so annoyingly stupid through most of the movie it's unbelievable. The only thing stopping the movie from falling on its face completely are some actually interesting and believable plot twist that redeem the movie to some extend towards the end. And the final 15 minutes are actually gripping and very well made. Still, could have been much better and not nearly as good as the critcs score suggests.",0
3745,"Down the back of Ogdenville lies nowhere USA,where every day is bad, then something makes it a whole lot worse. Convincing performances on planet real life where weapons are in plentiful supply. Bethany Anne Lind is tremendous,and appears to have gone to the trouble of having a couple of fistfights in preparation for the role. Either that or make up is spot on.The rest of the cast are happy to eat dirt with her too. Don't listen to Roger Ebert.",1
3746,Very clever and engaging thriller,1
3747,"Surprised to see such a magnificent score with the critics.

Starts fast and grabs you and then peters out rather miserably despite a shock ending. The story itself is completely nonsensical by the end with a very middling (at best) script, with some very cliched dialogue at times.

Having said that, Bethany Anne Lind and Will Patton give fine performances despite these deficiencies.",0
3748,"I'm surprised that this film has gotten so many good reviews. I just don't see it. One critic even compared it favorably to the Coen brothers' _Blood Simple_. This film has none of the deviousness and dark humor of that film. Not even close.
It does have the ""everything that can go wrong, will"" and ""everybody suspects everybody"" themes of _Blood Simple_, but its characters are nowhere near as interesting---including the protagonist Leigh (Bethany Anne Lind) who, in the opening scene, has apparently murdered an intruder at her car repair garage. She disposes of the body in a shed at his family's place because she feels conscience stricken. Not too bright. She's a drug-addicted single mom, divorced from a sleazebag, and she has a juvenile delinquent son Ryan (Jared Ivers) who seems like a stock character at first but plays a bigger role than expected. 
Little by little, what actually happened that night is revealed. But it's no big surprise, and it's been done countless times before in other films.
There's also a missing piece of jewelry from the crime, a bit stolen directly from Hitchcock's _Frenzy_.
It's always good to see Will Patton, who makes the most of his part as Leigh's corrupt cop father, but even he can't save this film from it's overbearingly dismal atmosphere.
Remember how you laughed at the violence in _Blood Simple_ just because the scenarios were so absurd? This film will elicit no laughs. Just complacency, because it's all so deadly serious in spite of the fact that we have little interest in the characters. 
The ending degenerates into a bloody shoot out, of course, and don't expect a happy ending. Or better yet, don't bother watching it.",0
3749,"Good stuff, bold ending.",1
3750,Fine taut drama with a nice spin or two. Lind is especially good. Patton was good as a no-good dad (again). 3 stars,0
3751,"As with most movies now reviewed on Rotten Tomatoes, the audience is much more discriminating than the professional critics who have dumbed down their standards to accommodate the wishes of RT.  Ten years ago, this contrived, purposely deceptive mediocrity would have barely survived rottenness.  Spoiler:  The movies I hate the most are the ones whose sole purpose is to fool the viewer.  This movie went out of its way to do so.  And, was it really necessary to make such a big deal about her father's past crime?  What relevance did that have to the main plot?  Lastly, this woman was so amazingly stupid it made her tragedy much less empathic.  You just can't feel that bad about an idiot.",0
3752,What a great surprise. Ran across this by accident. You'll be thinking about this movie the next day.,1
3753,"While the acting and direction are to be commended, to label this film as a thriller is the worst kind of false advertising.  The movie offers nothing to raise your pulse or inject any adrenaline to your system.  If this is what you are looking for, you will be severely disappointed.  While they movie may have been quite good if simply labelled as a drama with all of the relevant expectations, expecting a thriller destroys all of the positives that would have come from a slow, methodical drama.",0
3754,"This is quite a melancholic/atmospheric film, featuring some great cinematography, cloudy Icelandic shots (the choice of film title becomes very clear within the first few minutes of the film - the irony of it being called 'white, white' when the content is distinctly 'black, black' did not pass me by either) and I also appreciated the use of instrumental music in the background at key moments, to perhaps help the viewer imagine the state of the people depicted on screen.

Suffice to say its got quite a mysterious feel to it. I couldn't help wondering what we'd learn about the rather quiet and sullen main character and his grand child, who I was concerned for given the man's temperament. There's even a surreal element to this film, with segments relating to a particularly bizarre show originally depicted on a TV screen within the house (during the film), which sounds really quite sinister and, of course, mysterious, plus ominous. It's perhaps a hard film to describe as such but I wouldn't want to provide spoilers, so I'll leave it pretty much at that.

If your a fan of Scandi noirs, of European mystery dramas, then yes, I would recommend this film.",1
3755,"A White White day is the most harrowing, most depressing, and most realistic interpretation of grief in any movie I've ever seen. Throughout this movies 109 minute runtime, we are shown one of the most emotionally harrowing films to ever come out. This is a cinematic experience that remains completely unparalleled.

10/10",1
3756,"Icelandic cinema is characterized by cold atmsophere, certain degree of mood, contemplative nature of its cinematography, touch characters and realistic plots. All these components are present in this film, which is fascinating to behold even if its plot involves such unpleasant themes as jealousy and revenge which are aggravated by the fact that the main protagonist's wife is now dead and he unnecessarily starts to dig into the past, albeit understandably. Nobody wins from these explorations including his granddaughter.",1
3757,"Slow-burning but with an amazing direction and scenes full of pathos, grief and sadness. Interesting",1
3758,"I loved it, but it won't be to everyone's taste; it's oblique and nuanced, with a very variable pace. It's Icelandic, so they're all watching each other carefully all the time (through traffic cameras in this movie), despite the low population density. Not easy to forget, though, and the acting is outstanding.",1
3759,"So beautiful to look at. You immerse yourself into it slowly, without even noticing it.",1
3760,"The naked end, 
the camera's patience. 
The mist. 
Buddies back at the police station. 
Lead, Ingimundur, played with clenched teeth by Ingvar Sigurðsson, is overflowing with compassion and heartless desperation. 
The whiteness of the title
more the contained weight of snowfall, 
than the emptiness of a future
with no one to confront, 
and only a blank page 
on which to betray 
one innocent in the cleaned-out landscape 
whose trust is unequivocable 
– except for the horses.
The movie makes much of time passing, but slowness is relative. One extended scene, small brown bolder bounces joyously down and down the hill, finally dropping into the water. Its liberation is short-lived. Its tumble stops in a new environment, underwater. It won't be going anywhere else for a while. 
When change comes, 
it is with dangerous force. 
Ingimundur may be mentally vulnerable, 
but his body is fit and determined.",1
3761,"I felt I'd missed plot points during the movie, particularly concerning the death of the wife and the possible involvement of the teacher. Like the Icelandic landscape, it was very cold emotionally, and the scenes where high emotions were displayed seemed to come out of nowhere. I didn't think the performances were much more than average: again, they seemed to mirror the lonely and cold world where the film is made. Maybe worth a second viewing to see what the triggers for the lead's extreme behaviour were, but not a classic in my opinion.",0
3762,"This is a remarkable film and for those that may be familiar with some of the subjects that it touches on, can be highly emotional. Other reviewers have left comments of the powerful effect that the setting gives the film, in a landscape dominated by the powerful natural relentless forces of nature. Into this setting we drop an alpha male lost in the grief of this wife, unable to express emotion until he suspects his wife of having had an affair, then the full force of his suppressed grief , anger , rage and emotional isolation erupts with savagery, strangely to be mastered by the forces of nature. Only in the final scene does the beginning of a long journey back to life begin to seem possible as veneer finally begins to crumble. Yes this really is a film worth watching",1
3763,"It may take trudging, but the fantastical dream sequence like camera work and the bond between grandfather and granddaughter make it all worth it.",1
3764,"This documentary has been a big realisation to me, it shows how much power the internet has. and also shows how dangerous that could be. it is horrifying without being unpleasant and completly depressing, because as there where. the docu shows that Matt had glimmers of hope, that maybe. one day, Pepe would rise again for the good.",1
3765,Now I know that a cartoon frog has more political power than I'll ever have.,1
3766,"A very tough film to locate, but well worth it, 'Feels Good Man' details the origin of the internet meme Pepe the Frog mostly through the eyes of its creator, Matt Furie.  Arthur Jones has put together a very detailed debut documentary covered just about every aspect of Pepe and Matt and the shifts in both.  The quest is to turn Pepe back into the character he was intended to be and not a symbol of hate.  Speaking of hate the Anti-Defamation League doesn't come across as tolerant, accepting, or willing to change.  The more you know!  If you have a library card check this out on Kanopy.

Way better than I imagined. If anyone wants to understand meme culture in the future this movie should be the first thing people view. Easily a 5 star documentary. It was oddly emotional too. More emotional than you would imagine a documentary about a internet meme would be. It really does have you cheering for the original creator. Pepe is now a world wide symbol meaning almost anything you could imagine. A symbol for everyone from white nationalists, anti-fascists, free loving individuals, to Hong Kong pro democracy protestors. Amazing documentary.

'A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon' features a solid if predictable alien story and does still include some top notch Aardman animation. I didn't personally find the humour as strong here, though it still made me smirk a few times. Passably decent, all in all.",0
3777,Funny and original; all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.,1
3778,"Aardman's gone and done it again. Wonderfully animated in the studio's signature stop-motion style, 'Farmageddon' is not only funny and expands our hero's realm with memorable characters and bigger, whackier experiences, but also has a surprising amount of heart in and an out of this world story that has clearly taken inspiration from Spielberg's 'E.T.' And of course, all of this is brought to life without a single line of (intelligible) dialogue – how do they do it. This is one kid's film that should be enjoyable for all.",1
3779,My Rating:.  8.5/10.,1
3780,"The novelty of the first film being an animated silent movie in the 21st century is gone, some of the jokes are more obvious or feel recycled from earlier stop-motion adventures and the premise feels a bit bizarre for something that's grounded in reality based off of what little familiarity I have with the show. And yet, Farmageddon still remains a fun adventure with not just great animation* but also very funny slapstick, enjoyable sci-fi themed pop culture references, a new character with an adorable design and personality and voice acting that, while based purely in gibberish and onomatopoeia, still has me cracking up just thinking what the voice direction was like. This was mainly during a scene in the climax where letters are being thrown and the antagonist makes hurt sounds depending on which letter fell on her mecha. I'm not giving you any context, see the scene for yourself. While I think the 2015 film will age much better, Farmageddon still offers concrete proof that, even with Shaun the Sheep being targeted towards a younger audience than the likes of Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit, Aardman always try their hardest to make their work animation classics and, after all these years, still enjoy their job and the painstaking work involved in making these movies.
*What makes it more impressive is that this movie came out a year after Early Man. The last two times Aardman released two films a year apart from each other, one was CGI and the other was stop-motion. In this case, both films were stop-motion, an animation technique that requires a ton of patience. While I couldn't find the budget for this movie and thus, have no idea if this was cheaper to make than Early Man, the fact that Aardman pulled this off on a time crunch, even if the movies were being handled by separate teams, makes it all the more impressive...though Farmageddon featuring heavier use of CGI imagery and effects, as well as pre-existing character models compared to its direct predecessor due to its premise probably helped.",1
3781,Another funny & entertaining movie from this crew that was fun for the whole family to watch a story about aliens coming to earth and the crowds that are drawn to them,1
3782,"Shaun the Sheep: In Space is what this pretty much is. Or well, Shaun the Sheep meets E.T.(an E.T., not the official one). It's got the usual charming humor you've come to expect and lots of shout outs to other sci-fi movies throughout. Maybe a little too cutesy at times, but still good nonetheless.",1

3784,"Fake people making real money from half truths. 
A despicable movie about despicable people, not the least of which the director who constantly twists and manipulates the timeline to create his own fake story for dramatic effect.
The two main characters truly deserve each other, a fake artist ( slide projector paintings are not paintings) and a junkie using each other for their own selfish needs while a spineless boyfriend pays  for their affair…rent etc.
Not raw, not real, not transparent.",0
3785,"Brilliant and beautiful rumination on the power of art and redemption. So many scenes in this film are so personal and confessional I had to remind myself there was a film maker in the room at the time. The camera is that unobtrusive. As if it's not even there. The underlying story is very unusual, intriguing, and utterly engaging.",1
3786,"Accompanied by the arresting painting talent from Barbora Kysilkova, Benjamin Ree presents a masterful work of passionate filmmaking, a fascinating film that is not only deeply touching, but also evoking and a study of the power of forgivness, as well as a analysis of the stranger than fiction bounds between human beings.",1
3787,This story did not go where I thought it was going.,1
3788,"The Painter and the Thief lost its steam in the second half, it lacked a bigger purpose and the runtime is too long, but the first half is excellent and the movie is fascinating in the titular complex psychosexual artist-muse relationship that was very well explored through many insightful and thematically rich conversations.",1

3803,"Another film in competition for the Oscars 2021 with a great theme, but rather poorly realized, by an author completely unknown to me, Darius Marder.

First of all, let's clear up a few untruths that are presented in the movie, namely, most medical insurances, even in the US, cover operations in cases of hearing loss. Then, the implant placement operation is always performed first on one side, never on both at the same time. And most importantly, couples in such situations are most often encouraged to go through together e.g. learning sign language, and not being forbidden to do so for some mysterious reason.

On the other hand, criticism of the plot, according to which it is illogical for the main actor Riz Ahmed to continue making noise immediately after receiving the diagnosis (a couple of months of rehearsal is not enough to call even the most talented actors drummers), really doesn't stand, because it is natural for each of us, and especially the character as presented in the film, to need time to accept and face the new facts in our lives. It is these moments that are, in my humble opinion, the greatest value of the story. Unfortunately, the film did not go any further than that, and that is also the biggest complaint, because it has obviously long ago become a trend to shoot stories without any messages and conclusions.

The biggest praise goes for the supporting female role of Olivia Cooke, who, in addition to inspiring acting, allegedly performed all the music scenes live on her own.

In any case, the film deserves a passing grade, unlike some other nominated works, which did not manage to come up with the topics they set out to do. Sometimes it is better no ending at all, than one indulging in the mere commercial taste of the audience, with an extremely illogical plot and maximally stereotypical male characters, using ""subverted expectations"", as in the so-called revenge-feminist ""Promising Young Woman"", which is also in competition. We will see who will do better at the awards ceremony in April.",0
3804,"It was better than I thought it was going to be.  The title, and to some degree the description, led me to expects some stupid, college frat slapstick comedy.  While there was a small bit of that stupid stuff, it was mostly about a distraught youth finding his way.  Heartwarming, actually.",1
3805,"Shithouse is Raiff's clever indie gem debut. A modern college based romantic comedy full of sensitivity and wittiness. Don't let the brash title deceive you, this is all about familiar feelings. This is the shit.",1

Everyone should  watch this movie, even though not relatable, it will help one understand what humans go through in real lives.",1
3807,"This is a beautiful movie. It's so brutally honest and heartfelt. Shithouse lives and breathes through Cooper Raiff - director, writer, and star. Each scene is so carefully done and either gut wrenching or butterfly inducing. This movie transported me into these characters' college world so successfully I had a weird come down back to earth after watching it. To top it off - the soundtrack could not have been better. Amazing movie.",1

It seems like it'll be a college comedy about a frat house but instead it's a character study on two people who are struggling in different ways.

3810,"A lot of attention to detail and honesty.  Most characters feeling very much like people I've met.  Not exactly revolutionary, but very much on point.  Extra quarter-star for how hard it must be to make a decent movie in this shithouse environment.  4.25/5",1

It is the feature film debut from 24yo Cooper Raiff, who also wrote, produced, edited and stars in the film. He plays Alex, a freshman college student who is really struggling to fit in and find friends. He has an obnoxious roommate which doesn't help matters, but one day his roommate invites him to a party at 'Shithouse'. At the party he meets Maggie and they awkwardly hit it off. They leave the party and spend a night of wandering and talking. In fact most of the film is taken up with their conversation. But after making out, the next day becomes more awkward and Maggie feels suffocated by Alex. It's all very beautifully handled and illustrates the growing pains of leaving home and becoming an adult. The film has a gentle sprit and feels extremely natural and unforced. An absolute credit to Raiff.",1

3815,Shreck is a force to be reckoned with and clearly did her research beforehand. I learned so much from her show and hope to continue learning about the atrocities that have been rationalized by the Constitution in hopes of one day making it truly better. A must-see for anyone who considers themselves to be a feminist.,1

3818,"My 15-year-old and I are fans of live theatre so when we saw this movie version of a live play listed on Amazon Prime, we were interested. Within 15 minutes, we were hooked! What an amazing evening of theatre. It runs the gamut - part one-woman show, part Constitutional history class, part actual debate - all absolutely well done, all riveting. Parents, if you have a teenager in the house and are looking for something to watch together, I 100% recommend this movie.",1
3819,"A really smart, thoughtful exploration of the U.S. Constitution told through both history and personal events. Schreck is energetic and charismatic. It ends with a lively debate that I still play out in my mind sometimes.",1
3820,"Heidi Schreck is brilliant in her play, 'What the Constitution Means to Me', where she connects her life to the Constitution in a mostly seamless way.  There are some moments designed to shock, but it's a fair education on the document presented and ways that could improve it.  There's nothing particularly wrong here, but sometimes you feel like you're a student at a lecture.  With all the information, it's hard to not get overwhelmed and the main message lost.  When you are presented with facts, like this one: it was essentially OK to beat your wife going into the 20th century. It's hard to not realize that the world always needs to improve.  Who is fighting against equal rights for all people?  If you find out the answer he or she probably gave this movie 1/2 star.  Final Score: 8.0/10",1
3821,"Poignant, hilarious, incredibly moving and timely. Could not recommend this play/special enough. I thought I might be about to watch a history lesson but ended up getting so much more. An intimate and important filming of Broadway play.",1
3822,This is the definition of cringe. I,0
3823,"This is very much a bloody violent, somewhat gore infested film. Its pretty over the top and I suppose that give its the dark comedy - its very darkly comic, though if you don't like blood and guts, even in a somewhat exaggerated, almost comic book style way, then you won't find this 'funny' really. I'm not sure if I can call it funny in the 'normal' sense - of this type of film, its about what you may expect I suppose. I'd also like to point out that the film features some pretty bright lighting - almost all of the film takes place in one apartment, with old fashioned, bright wallpaper and strip lights etc. all clearly standing out.

Ofcourse the plot line is ludicrous, if anything then that may be what makes you laugh - the title gives it away a bit. Its a bit like a duracell bunny, with more than one character seemingly surviving the un-survivable. I'd like to think most people watching (well, everyone watching, surely?) would realise this is hardly a realistic plot but that's ok, its only a film - this is definitely not a biopic!. 

I guess if you like this kind of film then yes, I'd recommend it.",1
3824,Craziest movie I've ever seen.  My sister got me to watch it. Hint of Tarantino and the wild west.,1

3828,"""Why Don't You Just Die!"" is very, very bloody & very, bloody good.

Director Kirill Sokolov, the Russian Quentin Tarantino, successfully intertwines elements of American Westerns and pulp fiction into the movie's gripping, gory plot.

In all aspects – including acting, cinematography, screenplay, and soundtrack, it's a near-perfect film noir.",1
3829,"As promising a debut for Kirill Sokolov in this genre as QT's ""Reservoir Dogs"" or Danny Boyle's ""Shallow Grave"". I found this far more entertaining than I could have imagined thanks to its wonderfully morbid sense of humor, the crisply-paced editing, and Sokolov's restless camera that reveals a natural born filmmaker. Certainly not for the squeamish, but a fine late-night, blood-soaked yarn nonetheless.",1
3830,"The atmosphere is like in Tarantino's films, brutality is enormous, but with good taste and sense.",1
3831,"Absolutamente divertida y gamberra. Su realización, una mezcla extraña entre la ultraviolencia Tarantinesca y el extravagante manejo de cámara del cine de Jean Pierre Jeunet, hacen que su visionado sea extremadamente dinámico y es difícil que te deje indiferente, incluso cuando la acción y ritmo pega un fuerte decelerón en la segunda mitad.

De lo que más me ha gustado de 2020.",1
3832,"Brutal, and brutally funny. This film is a Russian Sam Rami, Tarantinoesque blood fest with an interesting twisty story that may be predictable at time's but getting to the punch line makes this watch worth it.",1
3833,"Possibly my first Guatemalan horror film, this version of La llorona touches on issues in Guatemala while also trying to maintain the viewer's attention and it doesn't always succeed.  This is more supernatural than horror, and as the backstory builds, it is a slog.  The pacing is slow and at only 99 minutes it felt like significantly longer.  Perhaps this is more for the people in the county of origin, but you also need a little of the backstory of La llorona. Learning those details after watching the feature   left me empty.  Final Score: 5/10",0
3834,"Don't waste your time. One of the most boring movies I've ever had the displeasure to watch. Nothing remotely interesting happens until the last 15 minutes, and even then it's mediocre at best. This film shouldn't be labeled suspense/horror under any circumstance. I haven't wanted a refund so quickly for anything else. The only potential I can see is using this movie if you're having trouble sleeping, because it will put you out by how awfully slow it is.",0

3836,"WARNING: DON'T READ THE SYNOPSIS OF THIS FILM, I CAN GUARANTEE YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL BE RUINED! ALSO, THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS! ""La Llorona"" is a political horror film without being political and almost without being a horror film. I don't consider this film a political movie because it doesn't pick a side, the political scenario, despite being essential to the plot, is just a background, and I think this is a hit. And I said ""almost without being a horror film"" because it's not too scary or disturbing, and not every horror film must be, look at ""Lamb"", for example, it's a fantastic non-disturbing horror movie. Instead of ""horror"", I would say that this Guatemalan production is a supernatural thriller, as the atmosphere of tension is well built and the primary focus is the story. And the characters are good. Alma (María Mercedes Coroy) is a mysterious protagonist, Enrique (Julio Díaz, whose character is based on Efraín Ríos Montt, considered the most sanguinary dictator of Guatemala) is more instrumental than a character properly but he does his job, Valeriana (María Telón) is the ""bridge"" between the Guatemalans and the Ixil people as she is the only main character who speaks their language (alongside Alma, obviously), but the two big character developments are from Natalia (Sabrina de la Hoz) and Carmen (Margarita Kenéfic). Natalia clearly has been involved with one of her father's enemies in the past, but she's not personally a communist (she's not in the closet), and she loves her family, even being distant from her father despite also being his doctor. Carmen, Enrique's wife and Natalia's mother, is someone with an outdated mind but, with Alma's presence, gradually knows who her husband was. The ending is perfect because is when we know who Alma actually is and what are her intentions.",1
3837,"First off, this film is not even really about ""La Llorona"" at all. So not only does it disappoint you with that, it also has scenes that drag on with long, silent stretches of people being anxious and passive aggressive. It feels like they could have used a lot of that time to develop the story and actually make you care about those scenes. The plot doesn't really have any interesting turns. It is a long and slow build up, and the pay off feels like it was ten minutes of the plot climax that was obvious from the start.  The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the themes. Perhaps I would have been able to appreciate the film more if it didn't try to involve the famous legend and just did it's own thing.",0

Nominada en los Globos de Oro de 2021, es una película absorbente, inquietante y memorable con momentos de suspenso, pero es mucho más que una película de terror, con su tono político y su crítica social. La necesidad de que líderes corruptos y sanguinarios rindan cuentas y se haga justicia nunca se había reflejado de una forma tan satisfactoria como en esta película. Si no se puede en la vida real, que sea entonces en la ficción. Muy bien, Guatemala. ¡¡Que hagan un remake colombiano!!!",1

3855,"Once every couple of years, we get a well-made, high-budget, intimate portrayal of a protagonist who is ""poor in the city"". Told from street level and intended to highlight gaps in the social safety net, struggles against adversity, and triumphs of willpower, these films often feature candid performances (often from actors that are new on the scene) and realistic characters. Sets are simple and usually feature frequent on-location shooting to lend authenticity to the visuals. The critical approval and awards nominations roll in, and we all agree to meet again in 18 months to start the process over again. Rocks pretty much checks all of those boxes: a teenage girl, Rocks (Bukky Bakray), struggles to keep her head above water and support both herself and her naive, innocent younger brother after their mother abandons them. The best thing that the film has going for it is the portrayal of Rocks' own friend group, which comes off as candid and authentic, featuring portrayals of young Muslim girls as actual people rather than a bundle of assumptions or political talking points. Aside from that though, this is largely a well put-together take on the type of story that you've seen ten times before, maybe differing in key story points but hitting most of the same emotional notes (even if they happen to be good ones). 

Can't wait for all the accolades for this first-time cast to translate to practically zero high-profile follow-on success in the industry. (3/5)",0
3856,"To begin, I honestly did not like some things. Firstly, I can't ignore that the plot is interesting and the trailer is well filmed. But when I was in front of the screen, I was really disappointed because I found that the camera shots weren't professionnal. In fact, I think that it is one of the most important factors to make a good film. Then, I did not appreciate the characters, who were not deep enough from my point of view. The plot has been treated superficially and I think that it is quite deceiving. Finally, the end of the movie was the most uninteresting moment because we don't really understand what happened. I mean that it was too implicit for me so I remained unsatisfied. I honestly hope that others enjoyed the movie but I can't say it for myself.",0
3857,"The story of this movie is very moving. It speaks about different topics like poverty,
abandonment and friendship. The main characters are very charming, especially Shola

3858,"This realistic film was very moving and well made. We feel the authenticity in each scene, and we are directly immersed in the story. 
All the characters are interesting ad endearing, and I think they bring a lot to the film. 
We can only put ourselves in the shoes of the hero, Rocks, who struggles and manages as best as she can to live with her little brother, because her mother left them. 
Even if I was a little disappointed of the end of this film, I really liked it, and it shows extremely well the importance of the place of family and friendship in life.",1
3859,"I left the cinema with a lot of emotion in me, all the pressure during the movie was quite intense but a little boring sometimes. The teenager's aspect of the film was a little bit annoying but well represented, those problems between girls in college are needed in the show but take too much time and make some parts of the movie boring. The social aspect of the film shocked me and made realize how big the inequalities between people are: some are abandoned by their parents; others live without any problem in a good neighborhood. The film represented well the Inequalities between people and from where they come. The action was slow to come and made the film a little bit boring.",1
3860,"The movie Rocks, by Sarah Gavron is a dramatic comedy that takes place in the United Kingdom. In this movie, I loved the characters. The little boy, Emmanuel is so funny and Rocks, the main character is determined and she has a good mood, I would be friends with her. All the other characters have their own personality and represent a part of the British society. I like the places and the landscape because it is a good representation of the diversity in the United Kingdom, for example, the embezzling market with people with different nationalities or the contrast between Rocks' place and other rich places. The only thing which disappointed me is the story because it is so predictable, there is no surprise and there is no end. I would have enjoyed knowing more about their future.",1
3861,"When I saw ""Rocks"", at the beginning I was sceptic. But little by little the movie started to be a little bit interesting. The hero ""Rocks"" is a young girl who lives in London and has an absent mother, so we can speak about the parental abandonment in this film. I like the movie because first it is realistic and dramatic, and this often happens so that made me realize that we live in a terrible world. Rocks just tried to run over her problems but she just aggravated the situation, and Emanuel her little brother undergoes. I do not really like the end of the movie because; it is not a happy end like we hoped for but she just accepts the fact she needs help and went to a new family, a host family.",1
3862,"Rocks by Sarah Gavron is an emotional movie. For me it's a good movie because the main character is a teenager and it shows the new generation and the issues they can meet when they are young in our society. The girl, Rocks, is courageous and she does everything for her little brother, Emmanuel. That's why we like her. Yet, Rocks always has the same problems and it's a little bit redundant... The way it was filmed is very interesting because it's very colorful and bright. There are beautiful landscapes and we can see different cultures in this.",1
3863,"""Farewell Amor"" is director Ekwa Msangi's feature film debut but you would never guess it as this remarkable film feels like the work of someone who has been making films for years. The plot revolves around an Angolian woman who comes to America with her teenage daughter to be reunited with her husband after an absence of 17 years only to discover they are virtually strangers and it's told from the point of view of all three of them. However, this is no grim problem picture but a surprisingly upbeat account of lives coming together and how something as simple as dance, for example, can engage people on the most basic of levels.

The three central performances are outstanding as Msangi glides her cast seamlessly through the twists and turns of her characters' lives while getting in some nifty dance moves in the process. The fact that the wife and mother, (a splendid Zainab Jah), is deeply religious while her husband, (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, equally good), has lost his religion, if he ever had any, doesn't help matters just as her fidelity and his infidelity over the years proves a major hurdle they must overcome. But, as I said, grimness is put on the back-burner and this lovely character study is all the better for it.",1

3865,"Filled with tenderness and emotion, Ekwa Msangi lets us walk into the inmigrant experience and, beyond the sociopolitical transcendental themes, that strange feeling that re-encounter causes, making the audience feel all the changes happening around the charachters (brought to life by an exceptional ensamble), incluiding melancholia, nostalgia and, of course, and above all, love.",1
3866,"This movie truly has much deeper insight to offer than its basic subject-matter. It shows the characters of real people. It shows how real people have to deal with things, especially when things are not so good all around, especially when things are simply dreadful all around.",1
3867,"This simple tale of an Angolan immigrant family reunited after 17 years apart tells the story of how they seek to pick up the pieces and move on. Director Ekwa Msangi's debut theatrical narrative feature is told in three segments, one each from the perspectives of the three principal characters (father, mother and teenage daughter). Each segment includes details of their collective story that don't appear in preceding or following chapters, thus allowing the overall narrative to be pieced together like a puzzle. By presenting the story in this way, viewers witness the bigger picture gradually come into view in much the same way that the protagonists do, a refreshingly revelatory storytelling experience. Admittedly, some of the material is somewhat predictable and more than a little bit sentimental, but these drawbacks are compensated for by fine performances, touching writing and a pervasive warmth, all aimed at shining a bright light on the experience of what it's like to live under circumstances such as these. It's an important message in a time like this, with so many from so many places living under similar conditions. In doing so, the picture illuminates the connections, challenges, hardships and reconciliations that those living out the immigrant experience go through and share with one another, no matter what their points of origin, ports of entry or hopes for the future may be.",1
3868,"It's a noble effort that never quite connected with me the way I had hoped.  In fact, I found myself struggling to find a reason to continue with the film.  It actually put me to sleep twice.  So I gave it a rewatch and still it just didn't resonate.  The focus wasn't there perhaps because it's a totally unrelatable for just about everyone watching.  The tangents come and go as if from another film.  It just didn't work for me.  Final Score: 5/10",0

3872,"In an attempt to better life for his family, a man leaves war-torn Angola for the US. Seventeen years later, his family comes to join him. As can be expected, they're virtual strangers to each other and have challenges reconnecting. The narrative is divided into 3 parts, told from the POV of the father, daughter and mother. This is NOT about the political issues of immigration, but an examination of the relationships. The exposition is relayed gradually, slowly adding resonance to their back stories. With naturalistic skill the performances beautifully capture the complexity of the characters. Writer/director Ekwa Msangi has kept the focus understated, while remaining effective in its quiet emotional authority.",1
3873,"Uncovers an endless number of unimaginable facts. Shocking, it generates a lot of impotence and discomfort due to how things develop and turn out. One more example of the power and reach of the social media.",1

3875,"A powerful and harrowing documentary which attempts to analyse the disappearance of Saudi journalise Jamal Khashoggi. Khasoggi entered the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul on 2nd October 2018, and never reappeared. The feature includes an imposing array of talking heads, including the former director of the CIA, the head of the police in Istanbul, and in the second half of the documentary, Khashoggi's fiance, Hatice Cengiz takes centre stage as we follow her to various meetings and senate appearances. The film is terrifying, not just for the seemingly appalling actions of the Arab state, but for the use of hacking technology, most notably as we learn of the way in which various individuals close to Khashoggi were hacked, but also the way in which the Saudi government control the countries social media outlets. Compelling and worrying in equal measures, The Dissident is an exquisitely put together docu-drama, and well worth your time.",1
3876,"I'm going to be generous and give it a 3/5 instead of a 2.5/5. The detail about the murder and how Saudi Arabia operates was interesting, but the silly animations (e.g. bees vs flies), unreadable fonts, annoying walking shots, and non-chronological order significantly worsened the quality of the documentary as a whole. It jumped all over the place for no justifiable reason and would have been far more pleasant to watch if the events had been explained in a logical order. I also couldn't get over the silly bees vs flies discussion. With that said, the cinematography was sleek, the footage of Jamal was high quality, a decent number of people were interviewed, and the message deserves support. Lastly, the pacing wasn't terrible, but I do think things could have been cut down slightly more.",0
3877,"Extensive and comprehensive documentary on Jamal Khashoggi's murder,the perpetrators and the political motives behind it, although it still remains unclear why a regime would fear a single man so much that it reverts to such a hideous crime.",0
3878,"A brilliant piece of filmmaking from Bryan Fogel that outlines just how awful the regime in Saudi Arabia is at handling PR.  Geez, you're about to make a deal to make tons of cash and you put yourself on the radar.  Fogel does what he does.  He tell a story and does it in a way that captivates.  Even if you're familiar with  the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, you'll be horrified at what's been uncovered since the mainstream stopped following the case.  Final Score: 10/10",1

3880,"Butchering Dissidents

The Dissident is an overlong documentary about Saudi Arabia's cruel dismemberment of one of it's own, Jamal K. He was very happy to be an insider when the regime was killing people on an industrial scale, but grew a conscience. Then the new guy MBS decided he'd die gruesomely and use it as a test for Trump. Trump failed the test. It's very good, but who can pretend that the Saudis have not always been vile, backwards looking butchers? Three chopped off limbs for me,",0
3881,"As much as we think we know about the gruesome, unimaginable murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey, there's more that we don't, and it's even more shocking than we ever thought. Director Bryan Fogel's chilling documentary about the incident, what prompted it, and the fallout that has come from it -- both politically and personally for those who knew him -- is staggeringly infuriating. One can't help but wonder how those behind this killing could be so unspeakably cruel and cold-hearted, and all over differences in opinion and outlook about the scope of democracy in the writer's homeland. The film approaches this story from multiple angles, showing how they're interrelated and presenting them in a layered, progressive pattern that grows ever more damning and upsetting with each new revelation. This release is one that should make us all mad while we're watching it. How can we allow such acts to continue in this day and age? If we can't bring a halt to such atrocities, one can't help but wonder what kind of future we might all have.",1

3889,"Intense and often real, yet sometimes too familiar, 'The Last Tree', overall, is a mixed bag.  We follow a London boy with a Nigerian family in a gritty look at a rough upbringing.   Other than our main character, Femi (brilliantly portrayed by Sam Adewunmi), we're not given enough detail often and we wander through time in an unexplained way.  The characters are never given a chance to flourish, other than a mother who was painted as evil until she wasn't. The film's tonal shift in the third act didn't work for me.  The finish is much too tidy and writer and directer Shola Amoo's is too light on pages so he can't earn the reaction that he desires from an average viewer.  It's beautiful and scored eloquently, but it overall just didn't work for me.    This film could have been great if there was just another pass or two at the screenplay.  What a disappointing miss.

3900,"Fourteen is an indie movie that shows its very small budget too often unfortunately. While the characterization is good, the dialogue is strong and the main actresses are quite effective in their roles, the editing is choppy, the direction is wobbly and the film fails to execute its intriguing premise properly, resulting in a big disappointment.",0
3901,"Soft spoken and understated, 'Fourteen', is also way too self aware and it becomes distracting.  There's no doubt writer, editor and director, Dan Sallitt, is trying to tell us something.  He has a character even say, ""I'm more conversational now"".  There is also the mention of budgets and I just found it all too inside baseball for a film that seemed like it was a really bad ""special"" episode of a movie about nothing.  This is a slice of life and very real, but as a stand alone 94 minute feature, no thanks.  Another in the long line of shorts stretched and I do mean stretched to feature length with lots of scenery, but a story that isn't pushed forward.  And despite it being a quiet indy, you have to be very in touch with every little detail which is supposed to draw you in, but instead frustrated me.  Normally, I like these films, but Salitt is so unable to take a stand on mental illness, instead letting this slop sit there.  It's a shame the filmmaker doesn't get it right, because the acting here, from an entirely unknown cast, is mostly outstanding.  They aren't given much to work with, but they do a marvelous job.  The final plot twist, which I could see from my porch, ties in the relationship between our two leads, Tallie Medel and Norma Kuhling.  This duo need better agents.  I want to see them again, perhaps even together.  GET IT DONE!  Long periods of time often go by from one scene to the next without explanation and I kinda liked it.  It's something that grew on me, but it's also distracting.  Your hand is definitely not held, but then we'll have two to three minutes of silence.  The plot sits.  Final Score:  4/10",0

3904,Fourteen (2020)- Brooklyn Millenial friends since teenagers- a teacher's aide and a social worker- find as adults that they are now growing apart. A powerful and truly beautiful indie film that rings true and comes with my highest recommendation; one of the best films of the year. I am always impressed and moved by Art being created on a shoestring and this embodies just that.,1
3905,"Reviews of 14 that I have read speak of amity. They seem to distort the movie's disequilibrium. It really centers on the experience of one character, Mara, and the flaws in her attempts to be there for a goes-back-a-long way friend. Being there for her school buddy is a tenacious project for Mara, a role delivered with wholesome innocence by Tallie Medel. The notion that the movie is about friends is a distortion. Although Mara had an alliance in the past with the other main character Jo, Norma Kuhling, and kept in touch, the movie primarily concerns just one side of this connection. The narrative is about incompatibilities. How the raw material of a child, an unsullied clay, plastic with the potential to meld, is, in the grown-up world, rigid, formed into a strange and inconsonant shape. Choices, priorities, experience are at play—and chemicals, both the body's hormones and, particularly in Jo's case,  a relentless top-up of abusive substances. 
The movie opens with the two women, their synchronicity already unmeshed. Jo is the loose cannon to Mara's stoic timekeeping and loyal attachments. Two Brooklyn lives lived between polarities of self-loathing and care for others. Are they typical? Is this a microcosm? Certainly, the movie is one of those New York dramas that report on life and relationships in the city with forensic attention to chat, chat-ups, schedules, and places to park. The problem in Jo and Mara's relationship is that it totally lacks privacy. It is staged in diners, bars, and social events. When taken home, it is in moments of crisis. The movie's settings are a snapshot of zeitgeist interior décors, institutional and domestic, as well as the anodyne environments of New York hospitality. This society is fixated on an individual's choices. One choice is the freedom to fuck up. Mara is no saint; she lacks the compassion, empathy, imagination, and generosity to be genuinely supportive. And it frustrates the hell out of her. The denouement is the equivalent of a secular confession, mother to child, or the older person's letter to her younger self. Childhood is a time of unconditional trust. Adults lose faith in one another, seeking to exist on their own terms. Mara's primary aim is to define her independence by constructing a safe space, keeping a distance from others. It isn't a buddy movie; it is a travesty of compassion enacted as an internal dialogue.",1
3906,Amazing documentary about The Go-Go's! Really interesting to learn the story of how they started out. They are a very special group of ladies!! And one of the greatest bands ever!!,1
3907,"What a nifty documentary that felt authentic and not a whitewashing of history.  A refreshing trip back in time for the all-female pop band, The Go-Gos.  If you're into 80s rock you'll like the inside story.  There are some candid tales in this heartfelt journey.  You have to love a doc where even the people who may be part of the history, but may not like the central figures are honest about the good times and the bad times.  A fantastic film!  Final Score: 8.8/10",1
3908,Actually better than the band. Served as a great tour of the late 70's early 80's LA punk and Indi scene.,1
3909,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
3910,This movie is a great story of not only the origins and formation of one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time but also a great story of friendships and sisterhood and the bonds friends make and how through adversity that bond is always there!!!,1
3911,"Great doc about the early days until their original breakup of this band. I want to see more. The movie ends at 1984. Fun footage, and excellent interviews.",1
3912,"The Go-Go's.  I had a great interest in seeing this documentary film because I am, and was a dedicated fan since the 1980's, the beginning of the Go-Go's career.  Full disclosure: I was a huge Go-Go's fan.  So, no surprise that I watched the premiere of the documentary on the day it was released, July 31, 2020.  Since then, I have seen the film 4 times.  I rated this documentary high for the following reasons:
1.  I felt like the director brought in authentic truthful comments from the people portrayed in the film, mainly the artists that worked with the Go-Go's and the Go-Go's themselves.  There was no ""real-life but scripted"" feeling at all.
2.  The documentary's background history of the Go-Go's was something new and fresh that I had never known before as a young fan; and I found it fascinating that I really didn't know a lot about the Go-GO's , who they were, their talents, their story,  and where they came from.
3.  I saw so much in this documentary that would be familiar to a genuine fan but I also saw new photos, news-clippings, and video that I had never seen before.

When the documentary was over, my immediate reaction was I  felt like it was too short and I wanted more. It also made me happy and I knew I would watch it again.",1
3913,A favorite documentary of the year. I love the Go-Gos and their story but I love this telling of it. There is great humor and care and love in all of it. I look forward to watching it again,1
3914,"I was never a big fan back in the day but I wasnt a hater either. I liked some of their tunes. What I found appealing about this doc was the humble, yet brutal honesty. Not just about their R&R lifestyle, fame, or breakup which had the usual traps, but their honesty that the sanctity of music wasnt the driving force behind their formation. That it was the punk/ska scene they just wanted to be a part of and music was but a means to an end. One of them says basically ""We sucked. But we didnt care. Nobody did. It was punk. We just plugged in and played and whatever happened, happened."" Not exactly a Prince or Buddy Holly perfectionist, respect the craft mindset. But its who they were and they didnt deny it. It wasnt until they added a few key pieces that the musicianship, work ethic, and quality elevated...which ultimately paid off. I also respect their Pioneer legacy and the guts it took to make some of the uncomfortable decisions & changes they had to make to become what they did. Its not ""If I Leave Here Tomorrow"" but its still a good music doc definitely recommended.",1
3915,"I was never huge Go Gos fan. Simply enjoyed their ugly pop songs. This documentary has given me a much better appreciation for their music, the women behind that music, their achievements and struggles. I was moved.",1
3916,I learned so much and I was sobbing by the end of it. Thank you for such an important and personal documentary. More people need to see this.,1
3917,"This documentary feels in many ways like it was overdue and absolutely necessary. Disclosure set out to address all the cliches and misconceptions around what it realistically means to be trans in juxtaposition to the trans experience as represented through the media since the early 1900s. Some misconceptions were devastating, such as the correlation between transvisibility in mainstream media + increase at which trans people are being murdered. And some misconceptions are just easy to lose sight of their significance, such as how problematic it is to continue to have cis gendered men playing transwomen on the silver screen. The narrators were compassionate, knowledgeable, and eloquent. Actors such as Laverne Cox, Jen Richards, Brain Michael Smith, and so many more, took time to comprehensively explain the tropes, stigmas, history, current oppression and created an opportunity to demonstrate that now, more than ever, trans people are centering themselves in their own stories. 

In the true spirit of a documentary, I walked away feeling armed with knowledge, compassion, and a bit of shame about my preconceptions around transfolks. But at one point I consciously recognized the importance of the media and how they truly play such a large role in forming and developing individuals' opinions on things they do not know in real life. 

While Disclosure critiqued the portrayal of the trans existence through the eyes of celebrities, it could have gone further to give voice to the everyday trans existence. The documentary showcased the feelings and sentiments of those in the films. But it could have also incorporated what emotions were elicited for individuals who watched these films as a part of their childhood from their homes, and how these portrayals impacted their own perspectives.

This connects to Kimberlѐ Crenshaw's lecture on The Urgency of Intersectionality (2016) when Crenshaw introduces the case of Emma DeGraffenreid. DeGraffenreid believed she was fired from her job for being a black woman. When she took this issue to court, the judge said that she was not fired for being a woman, because her former office hired women, and not fired for being black, because her office hired African Americans. However, they would not acknowledge DeGraffenreid's intersectional identity as a black woman, meaning they believed it would be overly-advantageous for Emma to claim to be discriminated against by both the identity markers combined. Crenshaw goes on to explain that the law, and therefore our society, have not yet accepted intersectionality and therefore people with multiple marginalized identities will continue to fall through the cracks. It is urgent that we cease looking at a flat dimension, a labeled box that a person fits into, rather than a three dimensional experience of a person. This can be applied to the many different yet intersecting identities of being BIPOC, queer, and trans, such as explained in Disclosure. 

This documentary highlights the intersectionality of trans people's lived experiences; what it may be like for someone who is black, who is queer, and who is trans. And though 9 out of 10 people report not personally knowing someone who identifies as trans, Disclosure respects the humanity of being trans rather than salacious, historically inaccurate tropes by showing that trans people have always existed and will continue to be members of everyday society. Disclosure also challenges the gender binary and heteronormative assumptions in mainstream media. They challenge why media and films are only just beginning to center trans people within their own stories, rather than erasing or speaking for them. 

In order for this documentary to be highly educational, I would recommend it as a resource for teacher preparation and secondary school curricular material. I believe it would be highly impactful for teachers and teachers in training to watch this in order to understand the many dimensions of any given student who may be sitting in their classroom. As Disclosure explains, we may have no way of knowing who identifies as trans because it is not necessarily recognizable; we must move past the tropes of bodily markers and become cognizant of the private experience of students who may be questioning their gender, identity, and sexual orientation. After the documentary is prioritized for teachers first, it could be very impactful for students at a secondary level, for those who are questioning or struggling with the very same issues. Because if Disclosure succeeds at anything in this documentary, it is making their audience consider life beyond a gender binary and how we must accept all facets of a person if we are going to thrive as a society.",1
3918,"This is important and I'm glad it exists! It definitely focuses more on the experiences of trans women in Hollywood than those of trans men and non-binary people, but I think that probably tracks with the levels of representation (good and bad) in media to date.",1
3919,"As a trans person, I approve of this documentary. :)",1
3920,"The actors and actresses interviewed in Disclosure have the tendency to be overly critical of some showcased movies and they do conflate certain terms very frustratingly, but for the most part it's a solid look into the history of transgender representation in media, especially Hollywood, and how drastically things have changed in very recent history.",1

3928,"The Swerve is a thoroughly unpleasant movie. It's well directed and acted, with a strong performance by Azura Skye. It's not entertaining. Rather, it's depressing and disturbing. 
That doesn't mean it's bad. If your criteria for a film is hyper-realism, it succeeds greatly. But if you're in the mood for mindless, light entertainment, forget this one. The Swerve is solidly in the Diary of a Mad Housewife tradition. The theme of a woman losing her mind has been explored by John Cassavetes and Woody Allen. In fact, Skye's Holly somewhat reminded me of Gena Rowlands in Allen's 1980's Another Woman. 
Holly is a suburban high school English teacher with two surly, spoiled teenage sons and an unsympathetic husband who manages a grocery store. She almost anorexically thin, neurotically hung up on killing a mouse in her home, and upset about a childhood experience that her weird sister keeps bringing up. She gobbles anti-depressants. To add to the misery, her husband has been fooling around with one of his employees. One of her male students is attracted to her, and she has a shocking, inappropriate moment in her minivan with him. Not a good idea. It just fuels his obsession with her, and she doesn't try to stop it. Watching her descend into madness is not a lot of fun.
Some critics consider The Swerve to be about mental illness rather than female depression stemming from external forces. I think it's a bit of both. I wonder if women will respond to The Swerve differently than men. Probably. As a clueless male with a limited understanding of women's emotions and the way that those emotions overwhelm their lives, I felt squirmy and edgy throughout this film. I recognized Skye's talent and appreciated her committed performance, but overall, I was terribly uncomfortable. 
Of course, art doesn't have to be edifying and uplifting in order to be valid. It can be bleak, humorless, hopeless, and despairing. But as for me, if I'm feeling dark, I'd prefer to look at Munch's ""The Scream"" than to sit through 90 minutes of unabated misery. 
The final act of this film turned my stomach. It also made me lose my appetite for apple pie.",0

At the end I just felt profoundly sad. And, full of admiration for such a masterful portrayal.",1

She's worth the watch.  Somebody give her something juicy.  While her character is mostly one note she's tremendous.  Why do people run AT a gun?   Why is there nobody at the supermarket like ever.  I get it extras cost money, but holy moly I want to shop there.  This needs to be a lot tighter and crisp.  We have a some fantastic acting here, but again it tells the same story a couple times before we get to the obvious conclusion.  Final Score: 5/10",0

So not every joke worked, and if you can get past the premise that it's a comedy about high school kids spontaneously exploding yet they continue to go to school, it's a nice treat.

The protagonist, who is supposed to be a girl, behaves like a tomboy or lesbian, wild, aggressive, only the clothes and the 1 kg make-up is supposed to show us that she is a nice girl. Consequently the guy protagonist has zero masculinity. The writer is probably homosexual, because he/she has no clue how real men and women behave, act and talk, especially in a romantic scenario. Hint: two guys never hug in real life, but not in this ""film"".

Any normal man would literally run away from a girl like the protagonist in the film.

Now you should ask yourself the question: do you want to watch this two protagonist talk almost without stopping, in the entire film, that has zero plot, zero resolution? Literally after 10 minutes you just wish that they STFU, explode, die, whatever.

The only lesson learned: I need to unsubscribe from Netflix, because they just dump all these crap on you, and don't care if you are satisfied or not.",0
3944,"Really bad.  Don't get me wrong - it is well put together and acted.  I think the folks that made this achieved what they were shooting for.  But this movie was sold as 'campy comedy', so I was thinking 'Scream' - something along those lines.  Instead, you get an angsty teen talk about your feelings movie.  Even the premise about kids exploding, while providing an interesting set up, turns out to only be that... a set up so teenagers can wax existential.  The gist of the movie is 'life sucks, so live free and die hard' (paraphrasing).  This is basically told to us via narration, so, tell don't show.  Bad if you want an entertaining movie, good if you are a art/philosophy major or liked 'Twilight'.",0
3945,"there are one or two jokes that felt forced (the ET and benicio del toro ones for instance appear to basically just be non sequitur product placement), but in general it's a pretty good film. anyone saying it's ""too political"" is probably a hypersensitive trump supporter or similarly aligned and similarly prejudiced. there is one republican joke, and one portion where a football player is supported for coming out as gay to his team. this is not ""shoving propaganda down your throat"" and in general the movie is entirely apolitical.

i will say that the ending was a disappointment, and that it didn't seem 100% necessary to keep plodding along with the protagonist's ennui, but i think the film is supposed to just be about loss, so it doesn't exactly matter too much. it would have been much more satisfying to get an explanation, or some kind of closure, but as the protagonist says herself, it's ""super anticlimactic"". imo just saying so as a joke doesn't excuse the movie actually being anticlimactic.",1
3946,"Well worth the time for horror buffs. Interesting story, good performances and suitably creepy and at times unnerving.",1
3947,"Solid 4.5 stars. Solid begining and middle, the end was a little rushed but satisfying. 
There are some definitely disturbing scenes, my favorite involved flossing. That one scared the hell out of me. Worth a watch if you want a simple horror.",1

3952,This movie was an entertaining watch. The movie was definitely both creepy and disturbing at times. This movie deviates from the normal formula and takes a different path. The premise was good and the execution of the film was excellent! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good scare!,1
3953,"This is the sleeper hit of 2020.  It was fast paced, which is a nice change in horror.  It was grim, unsettling, unnerving and I absolutely LOVED it.  Casted perfectly, written superbly, it was a great ride.  It's like a love letter TO horror fans FROM horror fans.  Highly recommend!",1
3954,"Delightfully compact and fantastically unsettling. If you're normally frustrated by films in the genre having perpetrators with gaping holes in their dastardly planning, Anything for Jackson's antagonists being refreshingly organised will be pleasing to you. A few shocks go a long way in this well-paced affair. For a film you haven't heard anything about, this is probably up there in terms of quality. Genuinely good.",1

3956,"Although the movie's emotional power is hollowed out by its dreadfully slow pacing that will put mainstream viewers off, for those who love sumptuous photography, this movie offers several dozen of the most purely captivating images of the year. As a study in the use of chiaroscuro and the use of tableaux to tell a story, and as a study in the opposite of the conventional wisdom of movies being purely for escapism, I can recommend this to viewers wishing to broaden their understanding of what a movie can be and how can be told.",1

3960,"Exquisite atmospheric cinematography and lighting aside, this otherwise excessively tedious exercise in pregnant pauses, long lingering shots of insignificance, pretentious monologues and voluminous footage of mundane activities that adds nothing to the narrative makes one glad for the fast forward button. Fewer films have I seen that make the viewer long for the ending -- and, when it finally comes, it's largely unsatisfying, likely to evoke a huge ""So what?"" I fail to understand the critics' raves about this one, but, with such a dearth of new material out there at the moment, I imagine that almost anything will do to satisfy the appetites of the hungry.",0
3961,This is the kind of work that you end up appreciating the genuinity of the story. The coincidence that led things to seemingly funny situation but how it was just a part of their lives regardless. We all can relate to at least a part of the story as a human being.,1
3962,This is a great documentary about an adult bookstore in Los Angeles. If those walls could talk.,1
3963,"So much more than you'd expect, worth every minute.",1
3964,Fun to watch especially if you are of an age to remember the gay community b4 being out was much harder than today.,1
3965,"Just wish it was longer and got deep in some stories, but great overall.",1
3966,fascinating look into an interesting family and their business.,1
3967,"It's hard to review this without spoiling it (though the poster might give it away), as the surprising subject matter is definitely part of the fun for me as an audience, so I will be brief (for a change). This Netflix documentary by Rachel Mason is primarily about her Jewish parents who run a bookstore in Los Angeles in the 1970s. Working with a limited budget, I imagine, the result is akin a more professionally done family video, but it also means this is an intimate and cosy affair and watching this on a small screen won't affect its enjoyment at all. The film acts both as a lovely paean to her parents as well as a visual historical document on the fight and preservation of free speech in the USA during the same time period, via people who are personally affected or involved in that fight. Between those objectives, the latter is almost a by-product of this sweet and passionate film that is brimming with love for a pair of unsung heroes, two unassuming individuals whose lives took an unexpected turn when they took over the titular bookshop and then has to balance family values with the risqué business they found themselves engaged in. There are no deep revelatory insights here, just anecdotal, perhaps even superficial, information and stories you'll glean out of their struggles but it is tremendous fun and extremely real and you will be so charmed by these genuinely fascinating people, that you will find those 90 minutes spent with them well worth your time.",1
3968,"""Circus Of Books"" is an Excellent Movie which tells You the whole story of how the family got started in the Adult Book Store Industry and how they kept quiet about it so that there friends and relatives, including their religious clergy where they worship did Not know about it.

The movie was written by Rachel Mason, the bookstore's owner and did it in Excellent Taste!

I more than Highly Recommend this movie which You can see on Netflicks.

Thank you.

Un matrimonio judío en Los Ángeles decide abrir a principios de los 80's una tienda de revistas y de porno gay. el Circus of Books del título.

La documentalista Rachel Robson (hija de ambos) filmó este interesante documental sobre sus padres (figuras centrales de la película) y este negocio, con una gran material gráfico, varios reportajes y una muy buena articulación de las dimensiones familiar, social, política, jurídica y económica del porno y lo gay, que incluye una monumental ironía que aquí no revelaré.

Afortunadamente estamos ante un documental que salta el cerco de lo autorreferencial y no ante uno de tantos ensayos autobiográficos narcisistas que sólo interesan a sus realizadorxs.",1

This really transcends the type of film it's set up as and the second half is a truly mesmerizing and affecting achievement.",1
3978,cool premise great music good acting,1
3979,"'Beats', a British drama, is simple and profound.  At the heart of the story are two teen best friend boys that are about to have their lives upended when one is going to move.  On one side, it's a coming of age tale, but on the other hand it's above love.  That love is of music and that brings the movie successfully together.  Set in 1994 Scotland, it's important to understand that if you were neighbors and the same age you were friends.  Sometimes you grew apart, but in other instances you become lifelong friends.  If you feel that energy you'll connect and love this.  This works really well on many levels.  Final Score: 9.2/10",1

3985,"I thought this was quite a good film. Its pretty memorable, mainly for the ending - the very end is somewhat haunting, though brutal. I wouldn't recommend it to people especially squeamish about bloody violence, so be warned. There isn't a large amount of said violence throughout the film but it certainly does provide impact, when it is present. It is quite a thoughtful film, with some good dialogue and the like. It is pretty sobering and certainly a bit gritty but its a worthwhile watch certainly, so I'd recommend it, yes.",1

3995,The best documentary movie ever made!,1
3996,"Very well done, Garrrett Bradley. The footage from several stages in the life of Sibil (AKA Fox Rich) since incarceration is pretty amazing to watch. The decision to time jump and the editing choices on what to use when, how much, the building effect on the viewer is highly impressive.
Rich is a truly remarkable, commendable human being. I applaud her for all her ceaseless devotion to the man she loved and father of her kids, as well as her efforts in helping others overcome adversity in its many, many forms.
That said the real sympathy I have for them is from the innate disenfranchisement that far too many experience, be it a minority, the poor, the disabled, others. A great many are a combination or two (or more) of these demographics; but they're fully human being all the time as well. Such a reality can prevent you from getting a loan you need desperately for your home/business/livelihood. It can obstruct your access to upward mobility. And it can drive you to desperate measures. But good doesn't come from doing wrong.
No real sympathy for the punishment for robbing a bank- stealing what most others have busted their asses for; taking a measure of security and trust from people it can take years (decades?) to regain; giving up on their own abilities, their own resilience to ultimately succeed. 
This is exceptional documentary filmmaking. But if god is so damn great and blesses you so much, then why did you get so desperate that you robbed a bank (how Christian/Protestant of you!) and ended up in prison? I know, it was a test, right? Apologists have a field day with those questions. 3.8 stars",1
3997,"There is definitely no doubt that the American Judicial System needs to be reformed; wrongful convictions, mandatory minimums, and draconian sentences for non-violent crimes, to name a few issues. However, this story is none of those things. This story is about a man who committed armed robbery. If you want to make a statement, you need sympathetic characters. People who may be wrongfully convicted, people who have been convicted and sentenced to decades for non-violent crimes. Yes, sometimes people are desperate, sometimes people need money, but only a small percentage believe armed robbery is a reasonable way to acquire money to help ease their woes. Those are exactly the type of people that belong outside of society, in prison.

""Like one of those retarded children"", as Fox Rich begins rocking back and forth. Yeah, these aren't the people for making a statement against the Judicial system.",0
3998,"Good insight into American ""justice"" with a unique filming approach.  Sadly, nothing I didn't already know.",0
3999,"I heard some favorable reviews.  I found it seemed to be a puff / vanity piece on the wife, Fox Rich, more than anything else.  Interesting, but not great.",0

Amazing film that should be seen and not described, though the ""Puberty Porn"" Rap? Holy Crap, Radha. When ""Harlem Ave"" opens? I lost it. Watch this film to its end and you will be rewarded, and I can't help think what Lin-Manuel Miranda might think of the whole bit? 

Beautiful performances by the whole cast, and the music is fantastic. Oswin Benjamin as Radha's love interest is so smooth and gorgeous you'll be cheering for Radha to get it (and she does).

The script is very well written. It’s filled with sharp and smart dialogue. The story mostly kept my interest. However, I do think the film is too long. It’s over two hours, and I think it could’ve been trimmed down. Also, I’m not sure why this is in black and white. The cinematography isn’t bad by any means, but I just don’t see why this couldn’t be in color. Overall, I liked this. Sure there are some flaws but this is a pretty unique and interesting film.

4015,"I only have a couple quibbles and one is the length. This should've been longer. I really, really wanted it to be. This deserved at least 2 hours to go into some more detail in places. That's just my desire though, and more because I so enjoyed what was there already that I wanted to see more. That being said, it is what it is and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It kept me enthralled and wondering what was going to happen next. Maybe it was predictable, I don't know because I was too entrenched in the story and couldn't stop to try and predict what was next.

Maybe it was predictable, I don't know because I was too entrenched in the story and couldn't stop to try and predict what was next.  

This isn't a ""Murder She Wrote"" type mystery story. Easter Cove isn't that quaint little charming town we see in mystery stories nowadays. It is ""a salty fishing village.""  There is cursing.  There is murder and blood.

My only other quibble would be a spoiler so I won't list it but the only way I get around it is by thinking that these girls were too young, too stunned, and too befuddled (having just lost their mother) to know what to do in such traumatic, drastic circumstances.  So I guess maybe it shouldn't be a quibble for me.

I loved the atmosphere. I loved the singing in it. I loved the acting and the actors. I really thought it was a really well done movie with a great story and nothing about it seemed unnecessary.

4016,"There is so much to say about this one - many movies handle the ""seedy underbelly"" of the world but its excessive and uninspired. This movie however goes about it in a clever way - showing us a world most of us are unaccustomed to (rural seaside maine) and shows us that world upside down. 

The only thing that I would say is unoriginal is the strong dialect and accents heavily reminds one of a ""Costal Maine Fargo"" especially when many of the main characters are Cops. However it lacks the humor usually injected into the gritty reality found in a Coen Brothers film 

That being said what makes this movie so unique is that when other movies focus on the sex, drugs and debachery - this film presents it as a mystery to be solved and shines a light on what lengths women must go to protect themselves. When men rule the world women must take matters into their own hands to take control/not get killed. The mystery then becomes not a who dune it or a ""will they get away with it"" but more of ""This is why not just these girls but all women have to go to great lengths to make sure they are safe and not taken advantage of"" 

Yes the ending is inconclusive and somewhat ends right back where it starts but if a conclusive ending is what you are watching for you are missing the bigger picture and the film is really saying.",1
4017,"This was a slightly unexpected film... I wasn't 100% sure what I was getting when I decided to sit down and watch this movie, but the oddity of the story was compelling. I certainly was not expecting an all-female elderly mafia, and I am not sure that it was TOTALLY believable. I love June Squibb though, so I think we can let that one slide. This was my first time seeing a performance from Sophie Lowe and she nailed it; I would love to see her hit the mainstream. 
Again, this was a unique plot, but I would have loved to see just a smidge more character development, especially for our two main character sisters. There was a lot left untold that could have been explored in a really interesting way. Did this movie suffer slightly from trying to do too much when it should have focused more on the people who were genuinely compelling? I would say so. That said, however, I did enjoy the film and would recommend it.",0
4018,"Making good use of its locations and establishing an interesting tone early on, ‘Blow the Man Down' gets off to a good start, but as the film progresses, it becomes clear that it's played its best cards early on and any tension that was built up quickly disappears. The focus is taken away from the more compelling plot points and characters and turned towards another mystery entirely: what is up with the matriarchs of the town? Well, the solution to that mystery is as unsurprising as it is compelling, and it feels like it takes a good while to get there. I see the feminist message that writers/directors Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy are going for, and maybe it's enough to satisfy some, but I feel like we could have gotten to the same place without sacrificing so much of what was promised at the beginning.",0

That's as much of the story as you need to know without spoiling the story.

Lee's filmography is filled with skillful performative platforms fueled by socially reflective commentary, which brings up a question where his fascination lies besides sharing the admiration with the fan base as a sole true value. The thematic approach under first impression is lyrical poetry dazzlingly backed up distractively to properly dissect like any normal approach towards the delicately complex, thoughtful format, hence how Lee connected with what the show means upon realization by eventual clarification of genuine exhilaration that sums up in truly capturing the sensation. Best to complement the presentation with reading the lyrics like any given poetry then revisit the show and enjoy it with better understanding/improved investment, but only if initial interest continues.

4051,"An example of how a real little masterpiece can be shot with a modest budget is this year's Oscar nominee George Wolf's movie with Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman. Everything is there, from the choice of an always current topic, through masterful directing, to extraordinary acting.

Unfortunately, the film is at least about Ma Rainey's music, as the title might interpret. But who cares about music, can watch ""The United States vs. Billie Holiday"" from February this year, which, on the other hand, has nothing else to offer but an interesting interpretation of songs and decent acting by Andra Day. Lady Day as the ""leader of the civil movement""? No, thanks.

""Ma Rainey's..."" is a brilliant film that will be remembered primarily by the bitter story, which you have to see instead of being told, but also by the extraordinary acting of Viola Davis, as well as the fact that this is the last role of Chadwick Boseman, who, unlike the role in the greatly overestimated ""Black Panther"" from 2018, shows all his lavish acting talent here.

A pesar de su intencionalidad clara, sus bien desarrollados personajes y demás detalles como los mencionados anteriormente, los guionistas no son capaces de terminar de concretar bien la historia, y se siente como un hilo que se teje de forma incompleta e incorrectamente; avanza a un ritmo lento, pero sin un argumento conciso, en pocas palabras, no trata de absolutamente nada, es predecible, tiene una narrativa muy regular, por no decir que terrible, el guión está colmado de errores argumentales, que hacen que fracase en un intento de ser original.

4062,"Based on a play that tells the fictional account of a real night, 25 February 1964, One Night in Miami is an incredibly relevant film for 2020, Regina King's feature film debut premiering at the BFI London Film Festival during Black History Month and a year when the Black Lives Matter movement has become much more prominent with the injustices in America being seen and protested all round the world.

After Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) wins the World Heavyweight Championship from Sonny Liston in Miami, he meets with Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) and Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir) to discuss their roles in the civil rights movement and cultural upheaval of the 60s.

One Night in Miami is a fascinating watch, Kemp Powers adapting his own play to the screen with a screenplay that pits iconic figures and their ideoligies against one another in a film mostly set in one location. Introducing each of the characters in their everyday vocations and the struggles they faced in being black men sets the film up for a rather powerful main act where they discuss how they can use their positions of varied success to be heard during the civil rights movement.

The contrasting feelings of how they should use their positions of power, whether it be through music, sports or activism, makes for a really intriguing and captivating set up and Regina King directs it with aplomb, giving the actors the chance to shine on such a narratively tight project, Tami Reiker's cinematography impressing too in the confined spaces of the motel room in particular.

One Night in Miami also excels in the performance department, the four mightily impressive leads each delivering a performance of power and stature that goes with the iconic figures they are portraying. Leslie Odom Jr. came close to being the best of the bunch as Sam Cooke but he was just beaten to it by Kingsley Ben-Adir's incredible portrayal of Malcolm X, the passion he had for his friends to do their best and not waste their potential being powered home in Ben-Adir's excellent performance.

What Regina King has achieved here with One Night in Miami, her debut feature, is nothing short of excellent, a tale of powerful black men questioning their own ideologies as they clash with one another at a time in history where their voices would be better united against the injustices they faced.",1
4063,"A lot of great talent on screen, even greater real-life figures. The concept lets you feel like you are getting a rare privileged look behind the curtain and inside the collective minds of these distinguished men.

4064,"Um dos indicados ao Oscar 2021, quiseram trazer as histórias de Sam Cooke, Malcom X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown entre outros, e se encontra mais uma vez no dilema de uma cena só, com algumas outras adicionadas no trajeto do filme, não sei porque mas acho que as histórias de pessoas negras tem pouco custo por parte de Hollywood sendo que no filme 'Os 7 de Chicago' tinha-se pessoas negras até mas com poucas atuações do movimento 'Black Panther' deixaram para se aprofundar no outro cara branco, mas esse é outro filme.

O que vi foi Malcom X a pessoa que luta por direitos iguais, extremamente querendo influenciar todo mundo, e com uma raiva interna imensa que Muhammad Ali contestou, uma hora no filme dizendo: 'vocês mais claros são mais raivosos que nós' e até o Sam Cooke cantor de excelente qualidade, ele contestou mas isso foi bom, pois fez que ele saísse do mesmo estilo de músicas românticas, e fizesse aquela linda música 'A Change Is Gonna Come', que pediu mudanças aos negros, eu vi o mesmo problema que aquele da 'A Voz Suprema do Blues' que muitas das cenas foram gravadas quase exclusivamente em um lugar só, e não diversificava teve as conquistas de Muhammad Ali em algum dos momentos, mas seria legal que fosse trabalhado mais no filme, e o retrato do filme era o Malcom X quase violento querendo movimentar o lugar, dizendo que até Bob Dylan tinha músicas sobre injustiça e que Sam Cooke estaria se prendendo para fazer músicas para brancos.

Até dá para entender, e que não poderia dizer com 100% de certeza pois não sei como era o comportamento dos caras, o mais calmo parecia ser o Sam Cooke lembrava até um anjo de tão quieto, mas o fato que o filme deveria sim ter saído da caixa e afirmo mais uma vez Hollywood usa o mínimo para distribuir os filmes para pessoas negras, pra mim eles não se importam muito, sem falar que o roteiro segue um lado só, foi uma grande evolução desde a decepção do da Ma Rainey, o erro aqui foi a falta de um roteiro que seguisse vários lados, um filme de 3h30m caberia bem aqui.

Mas é o que eu disse parece que a grande mídia simplesmente não se importa, em jogar dinheiro em uma produção que Malcom X, e todos aqui citados que mereciam um filme digno.",0

Aside from the primary focus on sexual assault, power, and race - I was deeply touched by the conversations about what we lose as a society WHEN TALENTED WOMEN DISAPPEAR. I think Drew's story, and her early successes, help us feel the deep implications and loss around this question. 

At on point Drew talks about her pain.

4107,"Interesting and Relevant but Can't be Saved in the End

I decided to watch the movie based on great critics reviews and ratings, which were so high we might expect the film to gain instant access into the criterion collection. The themes of the movie have great potential, tackling uncomfortable and difficult topics from a woman's point of view that haven't been seen before.

While initially, those unique themes provide viewers with tangible material that might move us to shock, embarrassment, and outrage, by the end of the film I felt tricked. The themes that originally make the film a unique opportunity to tackle new ground become so layered and strategically placed, that by the end of the film we sense that we have been setup to swallow almost 2 hours of continuous woman's issues and cultural taboos - our gag reflexes become engaged. Undeveloped characters and unresolved concerns are too much for one (short) movie to take on while keeping the story telling natural and the audience believing and empathetic to the issues the characters experience.

In then end, the story of a woman (Bridget) who unexpectedly finds new life perspectives from the influence of a little girl (Frances) still touches us and permeates through the pretentiousness. Although this element of the film might have been it's saving grace, it isn't strong enough for me to redeem Saint Frances.",0

Even as a squishy melodrama soap it fails. Or as an exercise in boundary pushing, bodily function positivity. Or as a realist exploration of individuals and relationships in mundane moments of stress and crisis. However, it's main failing is it's profound emptiness and lack of likeable characters (except for Frances who is delightful despite being mistreated by all of the other characters). In the more tender scenes that have the potential for a bit of substance and heart, it descends into a series of toilet jokes which (if being generous) have a normalising function at first but end up becoming the main crux of almost every scene. Exhausting.",0

Although I rarely laughed, that's certainly not a bad thing; it hit me in a different way to many others. I found the approach to the material shocking, in the best possible way because it made the film so effective, appealing to someone who would find it amusing, and also someone like me who was shocked, but greatly admired the film makers handing. After an abortion, thirty four year old Bridget struggles with the aftermath, and what she wants from life in general (that bit i can relate to). She takes a post as a nanny and slowly forms a bond with the six year old she is caring for. Kelly O'Sullivan writes, and is terrific in the lead role, taking you through all the emotions, even if your emotions are at odds with her own, that's what makes this work.",1

Unfortunately, writer-director Joe Penna's space-based, molasses-paced morality play is a tirelessly tedious slog padded with lots of filler and more than a few incredibly dull sequences. The chief culprit here is the script, which is rife with easily spotted plot holes and whose very title doesn't even accurately reflect the story's central scenario. The result is indeed unfortunate in light of the fine ensemble cast and the picture's stellar visual effects, attributes that are sorely undermined by the shortcomings surrounding them.

An horrific accident that took place on a Romanian club, involving a fire that killed several people ended up exposing one of the worst cases of corruption of modern time in Romania, from adulterated and overpriced disinfectants, to doctors and hospital managers being bribed to keep their mouths shuts and burning victims with no so serious wounds being killed simply because of lack of conditions, it's as unbelievable as it seems.

Politics is indeed an element of this movie, and politics is always a sensitive and divisive topic - sure they discuss parties and which one was in power when this happened and part of the movie is viewed from the perspective of the Minister of Health that took over, but I believe we should take aside this while watching the film, because politics will always make people suspicious and thinking that the politicians simply wish to protect their own agenda (a lot of times might be true but on others not so much, it's an inglorious profession).

I think that what should be taken from this sad and tragic story is that we the people shouldn't simply sit and watch, we should question and rebel when the common good is compromised, and also not less important, we should praise what I call real journalism, these individuals risk their lives when they expose these dark truths, they take their profession to a whole other level and they have the courage to represent what real journalists look like, not those cheap imitations we see everyday on our sensationalists national channels, the ones doing the hard and dirty job that keeps us all away from the dark.",1
4119,"An electrifying and groundbreaking documentary, Collective is a chilling reminder of the underhanded dealings of modern politics. Shot in a rigorously observational manner, Collective covers an event that took Eastern Europe by storm and led to massive big pharma and government reform. 

On October 30, 2015, a deadly fire in Colectiv, a popular nightclub in Bucharest, Romania killed 64 and injured 146. Of the 64 killed, 38 died in the hospitals. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered they were in close contact with some of the most resistant hospital bacteria on the continent, which festered in their uncleansed wounds. In the first part of the film, Catalin Tolontan's journalistic crusade is detailed, as he embarks upon a journey to uncover the negligence, corruption and political machinations that plagues the Romanian health system as a whole. Vlad Voiculescu is introduced as the new minister of health, and he looks to take Romania in a new direction for health and safety but faces massive backlash. Watch Collective to find out how this crisis is solved.

A widely-known Romanian journalist at the Gazeta Sporturilor, Catalin Tolontan, together with Vlad Vioculescu, ex-minister of health and patients rights activist, are featured in Collective. Tolontan colleagues Mirela Neag and Razvan Lutac are captured in the newsroom, printing papers and delivering fiery questions at press conferences. I especially enjoyed their portion of the film, possibly due to my interest in journalism, but also because of Tolontan's unique approach to tackling this case - calculated vehemence. Even Voiculescu's segment is intriguing, albeit a little more morose and harder to follow. Honestly, you can't help but feel bad for Voiculescu, the one upstanding politician who cares for people more than for the money in his pocket, especially in the tense election scenes. Tedy Ursuleanu, a burn victim, is also featured in this film. Her story is not illustrated in great detail, but featuring her is, to me, a massively positive step for Nanau to take. It adds a whole new level of ‘wow, this is real' to Collective.

The cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning; the camera team uses dimly lit, low contrast scenes to drive home the intensity of the incident and harshly lit closeups in telling the story of the people that Collective follows. The lack of ambient noise filtration in press conferences helps the viewer really jump into the story. Besides the plot, this has got to be my favorite part of the entire documentary.

Collective promotes freedom of speech, government transparency, and valuing lives over profit, which are all positive morals. There are political elements in this film as well as rather graphic scenes depicting burn victims, that you should be aware of. Also, there is some bad language and the whole plot is unsuitable for younger audiences. Nanau successfully calls viewers to action to speak out against corruption.

I give Collective 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. Collective is in theaters and on-demand November 20, 2020.",1

4125,"'Juneteenth' is a celebration of the day in 1865 when slaves in Texas learned they were free - two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. 'Miss Juneteenth' is a film based around a beauty contest for teenagers marking the occasion. Turquoise Jones (Nicole Beharie) won the contest, but was unable to complete her reign due to getting knocked up with daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze). Fifteen years later - with an eye to the prize of a scholarship to an 'historically black' university or college - she pressures Kai to take part in the pageant, but is so distracted with Kai's sexy but bad-boy father; with her alcoholic, religious mother; and with just making ends meet, that she does not fully appreciate Kai's reluctance.

It is unusual that a film centered around a beauty pageant contains no discussion of the 'cattle market' variety. Inevitably there *are* some racial politics (""There ain't no American dream for black folk"") but the centre of the film is undoubtedly Turquoise's determination that Kai should enter the pageant as a means of securing her future. The relationship between mother and daughter is nicely portrayed: they may sometimes get on each other's nerves, but disputes never last long and usually end with smiles. This is an example of one of the film's main strengths: it could easily have descended into soap opera histrionics, but every time the viewer fears a scene is going to dissolve into tears and shouting, writer/director Channing Godfrey Peoples dials things back down to have her characters behaving like real people - full of faults, but for the most part good folk. In this she is aided by Beharie - her performance as the determined, realistic Turquoise is naturalistic and engaging. Chikaeze also does well - when she delivers her entry in the pageant's talent competition the viewer wants to stand up and cheer.

Mischievously, I note that at a time when the Oscars are refusing to consider films that do not include a certain diversity of ethnic involvement, 'Miss Juneteenth' contains only one speaking role for a white actor (a grumpy shop assistant who appears in only two scenes). But for this viewer the important thing is whether or not a film is enjoyable - and this one certainly was.",1

4128,"Wry, heartwarming slice of (black) Americana about a young single mom who tries to groom her rebellious teenage daughter to win the hometown beauty pageant she had won, just before her daughter was born and derailed her life.

The plot is also satisfying as we witness a mother only wanting the best for her child and the struggles of her trying to do so.  The pacing for the most part is pleasing, but the film certainly feels quite slow to begin with.  Thankfully, it picks up at a nice pace for the second and third act.  Some key moments were also predictable for me, which could differ to others - Walkden Entertainment",0

4150,"The movie's title is a very innovative one, I knew this movie was going to be about abortion but that title didn't make sense to me until the middle of the movie and the scene was really raw and powerful. These are the kind of movies only a woman could make, its tough for a man to understand the bond between two women, the oppression they face from a patriarchal society and the ugly entitlement men feel over their bodies.

Eliza Hitman wasn't interested to preach to the audience, she wisely ignores it and rather chooses to hit the raw nerves of anti-choice men and misogynists. Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) is shamed at the start of the film, discouraged to abort her one child, her own state doesn't allow her to make her own decisions on her body, her employer doesn't allow her to take a break when she is unwell, helplessly watches her cousin get preyed by predatory men and also faces cash shortage but in-spite of all this she bravely aborts her fetus with the help of her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder).

Though Autumn is the protagonist of the film, we all would relate more so with Skylar. She sticks by her cousin no matter what and even undergoes great sacrifices to help her. This movie is a must watch by all and a great reflection of a male dominated society.",1

4152,"""Please respond: 'Never' ... 'Rarely' ... 'Somet...""
I KNOW WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE, KELLY. YOU'VE SAID WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE.

Honestly the most surprising thing about Never Rarely Sometimes Always is that we HAVEN'T seen something like it before - the restrained take on an unwanted teenage pregnancy in America. Most films dealing with subject can't resist tossing in some sort of rabid conservative element slinging slurs and threatening to burn down a Planned Parenthood clinic; in Eliza Hittman's take on the material, the closest that we get is a tottering, grandmotherly type carefully but doggedly assuring Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) about the joys of motherhood before tossing some dated propaganda onto the VCR, and the point is that such efforts are just as difficult to contend with and twice as confusing. The film is all about suffering in silence, as a character is forced to deal with a major medical and personal crisis without reaching out directly to anyone in particular because of the stigma associated with it. Keeping much of the character development and several key moments nonverbal, Hittman still remains in complete control of the emotional state of her characters, reeling them back in when the conversations and outbursts lean a bit too obvious. A very well done take on the subject matter, with an eye for attention to detail, particularly in minor characters. (3.5/5)",1
4153,Overrated uninspired Heavy Drama that's more depressing then inspiring  and its premise has stereotype and Clichés and the film has the modern day independent Cinema which has not improved much by my opinion this film is a big miss,0

4165,"A brilliant movie about a very sensitive subject.

As a long time researcher about the 1953 coup, I didn't expect to be surprised at all, but this movie brought up so much testimony and archival evidence that it belongs in a whole different category of documentary. I was reminded of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (2003). The depth of description of the crucial months and years leading up, during and after the coup is really remarkable. I learned tons.

I really can't say enough about this movie. If you have the chance, watch it!",1

I wouldn't bother with it, no.",0

4187,"This is an interesting music biopic documentary film, with friends, band colleagues and ex partners contributing by opening up about their memories of Michael. I hadn't known much about the person in question, other than remembering that Paula Yates, who used to present on a TV show called The Big Breakfast, was with him and I remember hearing he'd died from suicide, which is, of course, very sad. I hadn't known about his background, so that was interesting, although there isn't perhaps as much detail about his earlier years as I may have liked but I felt the film gave the viewer a good idea of what his personality was like. It is sad what happened, of course and its more complicated than just a depressed musician but I won't go into details, in case you'd like to watch it and find out more yourself.

Overall, I would recommend this as a good documentary about Michael Hutchence.",1
4188,"Tragedy strikes another wonderfully talented musician

There's definitely a mystifying and alluring quality to Michael and I feel like the documentary definitely captures that. A very eye-opening look into the life of a troubled, fragile and sensitive soul. Michael was definitely a one of a kind person in the world with a beautiful soul and a charm that could turn on any person - man or woman. He was a beacon of light that attracted everyone and he inspired people as well. But unfortunately he was also psychologically distraught and rattled - especially during the last couple years of his life.

My only problem with the doc is that it felt like some of the information being presented was ambiguous at times - maybe to add to the whole mystifying element. I wish they'd gone more in depth with Michael's mental state and history by showing more footage of him after the head injury incident. It kind of felt like they didn't want to show too much so as to not give us the wrong idea of him. But overall I found it to be a pretty entertaining and insightful documentary. All the personal behind the scenes footage definitely amplifies the emotions and makes it nostalgic. Almost like getting in a time machine and experiencing all these things with Michael. Overall, the documentary does a good job at balancing the light and dark moments, but in the end leaves you with a melancholic taste in your mouth. I mean you can't help it, it's a sad tragic story. Although a solid documentary, I don't have intentions of re-watching it and being sad all over again lol. This is a one-time watch for me. 

Wow, what a mysterious and ambiguous introduction. You don't know whether the phone call is something good or bad. I thought at first it was Michael's 911 emergency call. What a handsome and charming guy man. It's so cool seeing all the personal footage that was shot behind the scenes of his personal life as well as his touring life. That's crazy how he lived in Hong Kong for a while as a kid, I had no idea. I don't blame Michael for wanting to put INXS to the side and work on something else. He needed an escape from the glitz and glamour, and he found that with Max Q. Unfortunately Chris Murphy, the manager of INXS, didn't seem to care about what Michael wanted to do. He loathed the idea of Michael creating a side project and putting INXS to the side. 

I loved the handheld camera footage of when Kylie Minogue and Michael were together. They definitely had a genuine attraction towards one another. It seemed like a charming and passionate relationship. The whole backstory with Michael's brother, Rhett, was pretty sad. Michael ended up leaving him to live somewhere else when they were kids and then he got mixed up in drugs - with no help to the nannies that took care of him. And then to see the psychological disintegration after he was told he would never be able to smell or taste again. Man that was heart-breaking and shocking, I wasn't expecting that. It really messed him up mentally. 

God, and then what a mess with the tabloids and court and custody of the children and Paula resenting him. Really tragic and dark - almost nightmarish towards the end there. In a way, Paula coming into his life was the best thing but also the death of him. All the drama, stress and turmoil that he had to deal with kind of killed him from the inside. It's so sad because all he wanted was to live a normal life surrounded by family and loved ones and he couldn't even get that. In the end, that did him in. It's unbelievably so sad and tragic man.",1

I think INXS success has a lot more to do with Andrew Ferris songwriting than anything michael Hutchens did. His voice was very good but... Very one dimensional. There was very little range in it. Sort of like Mick Jagger. In the movie Bono talks about what a great singer Hutchens was but in fact Bono is an infinitely better singer than Hutchens primarily to do with his range and ability to alter his styles. Hutchens biggest contribution to rock and roll was his looks and that never bodes well for a performers legacy.,0

I watched this at home and I got interrupted so I didn't get to see how it wrapped up, maybe that was necessary for a real appreciation.

On that score, as well as my opened eyes and pity for the survivors, I'd give it five stars.  


However, I felt like it desperately needed editing.  I found myself saying wait, who?  Larry?  Weren't we talking about Howard?  Who's Stewart again? What's the timeline here?  Why am I seeing this piece of footage again?  Are we doing a reverb on this byte to show that people might have known but chose to walk away, or is it some other message I'm supposed to be inferring?  The vital question of who abused Howard was brought up and then dropped (maybe it was eventually answered and I just didn't get that far?)

4230,"June 26, 2020

Is there a more tumultuous or uncertain time in our lives than the eighth grade? I personally remember this year being particularly difficult, one that was probably crucial as far as being formative but nevertheless painful to endure. And my experience was hardly unique, for one need only consider the plethora of stories across all entire entertainment landscapes as evidence of just how universally traumatic and indelible this period of our lives can be. Several TV shows (""The Wonder Years"") and Hollywood movies, not least 2018's aptly titled ""Eighth Grade,"" often depict this time with painstaking accuracy. When they're done well, they can serve as comforting reminders we weren't alone in our prepubescent struggles. 

Given all the mainstream examples out there, we might think the concept of ""eighth grade woes"" is exclusive to Americans, but the latest addition to this ever-growing list is Bora Kim's heartrending ""House of Hummingbird,"" which debuted in its native South Korea in 2018 and has just found its way into virtual cinemas in the United States. This is fortunate for us because ""House"" is a treasure of a film, one that Kim has crafted with the utmost care and balance. Her deeply personal screenplay, which draws on her own experiences growing up in Seoul, brings a lot of rich and complicated matters to the table, so much, in fact, there were times when I thought the story might be taking on more that it could handle. But Kim shows she's in complete control of her resources and exhibits the right amount restraint so that any character or plot development stays within the film's own reality. And any scenes that perhaps do feel melodramatic can be justified as metaphors for the protagonist's stormy feelings and dubious interpretations of her situations, which will be relatable to anyone who's ever been 13 or 14-years-old.

Ji-hu Park plays Eunhee, our sympathetic eighth grader, and her performance is so raw and nuanced that we get a sense of Eunhee's vulnerability, fear and insecurity in the very first shot. She is lost, confused, angry, lethargic, playful and sad all at once, and it's her frustration with not knowing which emotion is the right one to have or display at any given moment that puts her on edge. She's cautious and self-conscious about everything she says and does and we feel for her because we've all been there. For eighth graders, one false move in any area of life can be a recipe for disaster.

But for all the tension brewing within Eunhee's mind and body, she remains quiet, withdrawn and distant because, like most eighth graders, she doesn't feel there's anyone to whom she can really express herself. She certainly can't rely on her family, which includes an irritable and often screaming father (In-gi Jung); a chronically depressed and docile mother (Seung-Yeon Lee); a physically abusive brother (Sang-Yeon Son); and a philandering sister (Soo-Yeon Park). Eunhee is the youngest and routinely feels like an outcast among this dysfunctional clan; she's all but a mute around the people who are supposed to love and support her the most. 

Eunhee and her family live in one of those cramped, high-rise apartment buildings that are now so common in cities like Seoul. It's a carbon copy of several hundred others next to it and a short distance from the parents' store, which generates enough income, but even so, there exists a coldness and despondency inside their home. Each family member fulfills more a business role than a familial one and it appears as though mom, dad, brother and sisters are just going through the motions of what their lower-middle-class society expects of them, devoid of any collective laughter or enthusiasm. They only ever seem to be joyful when they're alone and assume no one else is watching.

School doesn't provide Eunhee much of a sanctuary either. She has a friend named Jisuk (Seo-Yoon Park) but she, like Eunhee, is caught up in her own world and attempting to reconcile the abusive issues she too faces at home. Eunhee also has a boyfriend, but their relationship is mostly cute and superficial, stuck in an endless loop of smiling and giving each other mixtapes. Plus, Eunhee isn't even sure she likes boys. She has a range of desires and despite not knowing which ones to act on, she's smart enough to know which are true.

On top of her emotional and relationship troubles, Eunhee notices a lump on the right side of her face, the diagnosis of which isn't good. However, what's worse than the potential physical side effects of such a lump are the prospective social ones, for Eunhee is of the age when any change to a young person's physical appearance feels (at least to them) like a matter of life or death.

Based on what I've told you, you might be thinking ""House of Hummingbird"" lays on Eunhee's problems a little thick, but Kim approaches each of her young hero's dilemmas with directness and honesty. None is too grand or farfetched, and in fact it's our being able to see them as possible, even typical, that allows us to make a connection with Eunhee. We feel like we've been her at some point in our lives, including the moment when she finally ""lets it all out."" Like so many scenes in the film, Kim waits until the time is right in the context of the story for Eunhee to react to how she's feeling and not necessarily when the audience craves vindication. 

Kim's understated, down-to-earth strategy makes us believe the events of ""House of Hummingbird"" are happening in our world and not within the confines of a screenplay. Her direction with the actors and Zoe Sua Cho's meticulous editing, particularly her choices of when to show certain scenes and how long to hold on each shot before cutting away, give the film a flowing, inclusive quality. We feel like we're living the narrative instead of simply watching it unfold. As Eunhee seeks hope and recognition through all her turmoil, we're right there with her.

Even though ""House of Hummingbird"" is clearly a serious drama, it's not all somber and melancholy. There are many uplifting and hopeful moments too, which speak to Kim's knowledge that coming of age is a series both ups and downs. One of the ups is Eunhee's exploration of her sexuality with a fellow female classmate named Yuri (Hae-In Seol). They share a tender exchange behind a closed curtain in the hospital, a scene that comes across so naturally I wonder if Kim even had her young actresses rehearse or just improvise.

The film's best and most memorable scenes, however, involve Eunhee's relationship with an adult: the angelic Ms. Kim (Sae-Byuk Kim). She's Eunhee's Chinese language instructor who's on temporary leave from Seoul University. Through carefully framed closeups and reaction shots in their tight-knit classroom, and a limited use of sound, Kim subtly reveals Eunhee's slow infatuation with and trust in her teacher. It's obvious Ms. Kim inspires Eunhee for all the usual reasons a teacher inspires a student, but Ms. Kim is even more special because this the first time in Eunhee's early adolescence when someone has taken the time to respect and listen to her. They develop a touching friendship and Kim interweaves their bonding through and across several other developments so that whenever the story does come back around to Ms. Kim, her gentle, smooth face is like a breath of fresh air to both Eunhee and us. Decisions like these confirm Kim knows what she's doing storytelling-wise and they allow the film to really send home Ms. Kim's sage advice to Eunhee that the world can be beautiful, often when we least expect and need it to be the most.

I should mention ""House of Hummingbird"" takes place in 1994, which is important to know because Kim deliberately wanted to show a girl coming of age in a South Korea that was also coming of age. It was during this time the country was entering a period of technological modernity and economic expansion, which, as we see in the film, had far-reaching effects on everyone on all rungs of the socio-economic ladder. It recounts two particularly major historical events that are sure to be imprinted onto Eunhee's memory.

But as significant as the historical era is, Eunhee's journey ultimately feels timeless, which illustrates the film's power as a universal human story. The best coming of age tales, of which ""House of Hummingbird"" can now be included, are those that shed a fresh light on our understanding of who we are and how far we've come. In this case, the focus is on that awkward transition from childhood to adolescence, which we all know can be one of the most urgent times in our lives. Kim captures it pointedly and unaffectedly; she renders drama simply by relaying truth, which makes ""House"" one of the more moving and effective films of recent memory. And just Like our memories of eighth grade, it'll stay with us for the long haul.",1

To bash ""Katie Says Goodbye""  (which, granted, isn't so good) as being 'nearly 90 minutes of terrible things happening to the protagonist', or saying 'the lead character is so utterly guileless and innocent and kindhearted -- she's essentially a smiley face with a ""KICK ME"" sign taped to her back while heaping nothing but praise on ""House of Hummingbird"" is absurd bs. ""HoH"" is just as relentlessly miserable as ""Katie..."", but it's even more troubling and a friggin' bummer. So that makes it that much better, that's it's more depressing and worse to the lead? Both are movies with the same issues that could've been much better, imo.",0

So after watching it, i had no regrets. No bad comments, no negative reviews, if there's any kind of poor execution in the development of this documentary, it was easy to not to notice it. I was easily caught in the story and also hooked by his personality and by what he means in latin America's culture, that even now I can see his legacy and started admiring him for the very first time. I wish I could have seen this before he died.. As a latina I take this documentary as an statement, and applaud Netflix for giving us the opportunity of having such kind of entertainment and for celebrating Walter's life with this film . It's a very rich and meaningful documentary mostly for minorities and that embraces diversity, in many cultures and across countries.

4252,"Walter Mercado is an inspiration.  He gives people hope.  This documentary on his life is a must-see, however I couldn't help but feel Mercado and people around him weren't always 100% honest.  This is an infomercial of Mercado's career and it's pretty good!  He is flamboyant and positive and you can't help but to be motivated from his words.  There is a celebrity who breaks down after meeting this man who is relatively unknown to English speaking Americans, but who is revered by the Latino American population.  His story rings a bell, but if you weren't into the astrological universe you probably won't know him.  I wish they talked about his sexuality or lack thereof in some way.  He's a fascinating figure, but I guarantee everyone who watches will have unanswered questions.  His message is love and this doc is one that's hard NOT to like.  Final Score: 6.8/10",1

By the end of the documentary I was getting emotional and felt sad during his moments of hardship and death. I enjoyed this because it reminded me of my childhood. Even though I don't believe in astrology, I feel empathy for him because he was human like anyone else, and seemed to have a good heart.",1

Either that or you're on a payroll to say so, or being blackmailed. Once upon of time I might have let this propaganda influence me, then I was awakened to what's really going on. Propaganda can be easily produced in an acute time frame. Truth does come out over the long run. I've never seen hardly any film, great films over 70% on rotten tomatoes, much less 100%. That is like having record turn out in an election during a so called pandemic and Joe Biden doing better than Obama in both of his presidential elections. I mean come on do a little better if you want to make it believable. It's almost laughable if it weren't so sad.   The democrats ( and some so-called republicans) have always been the ones to suppress people, and then use those they suppress for their political gain. They create a problem so they can sell us their solution to ""fix"" it.  This guy no longer votes democrat and I am in that club with a whole lot of company. It's growing daily.",0
4257,Waste of time if you pass over one movie this year make it this one.,0
4258,"Clarification Number One: It's like anything Michael Moore creates, IOW it's not a documentary, it's a film. A documentary implies objective POVs, equal time and unbiased focus, exposing both the good and bad aspects regardless of how they affect the primary theme. e.g. See the Dutch study negating Bowling for Columbine, use of shock-journalism, editing and skewed & loaded imagery/words. 
This film takes a similar approach, hyperfocused from start to finish, it's goal was & remains to influence Base Voter's and reaffirming Emotional Base Voters. This has nothing to do with the character, her skin colour or her sex. Fear of cancellation or retribution explains the high marks, the overall intention explaining the release date & lifting the Paywall before Prime-only (Amazon missing out on $$$? That's a first) It was a long IE/EC type advert only allowed to run during the 10-Day IE Season before Election Day, technically a direct FECA Violation, but who cares, right?
It got ppl to the polls and created another ProgDEM device used to target specific demographics. BTW The Constitution does not grant a ""Right to Vote"". It is a Privilege. You need to look at State Constitutions, all allowed to vary (for now) before Right us in-play. Based on the unfair application and bypassing FECA Laws, plus towing the line, makes this unethical, immoral and failing by default.",0
4259,"No matter where one stands politically, most of us (or so I would like to hope) believe in a sense of fairness when it comes to our elections. However, as this documentary from directors Lisa Cortes and Liz Garbus details, the country is increasingly under siege from a growing campaign to deliberately suppress voter rights in states across the nation, exposing the myriad techniques being employed by self-interested parties to achieve that result. In telling its story, the film chronicles the history of voter rights from the days of America's birth through Reconstruction to the Jim Crow Era and eventually the Civil Rights Movement. The picture illustrates the efforts of various constituencies, from African-Americans to women to Asian-Americans and Latinos, in winning and protecting what's widely considered one of the fundamental rights of living in a democracy. But it then goes on to show insidious initiatives to turn back the clock, as exemplified by a number of emerging state legislative and policy actions, most notably the tactics used to manipulate the outcome of the 2018 Georgia governor's race and the efforts to derail the campaign of Democratic candidate Stacy Abrams. This offering thus presents a reasoned and damning look at voter suppression efforts, emphatically delivering an urgent message we all need to hear if we hope to preserve our republic. However, despite the importance of this, the film could stand to be less partisan and more even-handed in tone, especially when it comes to balancing its coverage of which states have implemented voter suppression measures, some of which have arisen in some seemingly unlikely jurisdictions beyond those that have surfaced in more readily expected locales. What's more, ""All In"" says virtually nothing about what needs to happen even if voter rights are sufficiently protected -- ensuring that our elections produce victors who are actually able to do something to get the nation back on track once they're in office. That could easily be a topic for another film, though one can't deny this consideration is inherently tied to being able to cast our votes in the first place, and, on this point, the picture is silent. Still, I suppose we have to start somewhere, and preserving the opportunity to help bring about such an outcome is essential if we ever hope to have a chance to attain that larger goal.",1

4261,"RATING: A+  Director: Lisa Cortes & Liz Garbus
All In: The Fight for Democracy is mainly about the voting and all the difficulties it comes with in the US.

Tremendous documentary by David France that shows us the actions of the NGO Russian LGTB Network.

A strong complaint about the discriminatory, repressive and criminal policy of the Chechen government against its LGBTQ population, involving their families as repressive agents, in a country whose president, the confessed homophobe Kadyrov, has the explicit support of Putin.

4270,"Documentarian David France chronicles the anti-gay purges in Chechnya during the late 2010s. LGBT Chechen refugees with the help of hidden cameras give the viewer an inside look at how they get out of Russia through a network of safehouses aided by activists who are trying to shed light on the human rights abuses in Chechnya.  The faces in the film are not real, but they are computer generated because they would not be safe if recognized.  This story should be on national news every day until queer people stop being killed for no reason.  This is a very tough watch and a break or two may be needed just to wrap your mind around what you just saw.  Final Score: 9/10",1
4271,"""Welcome to Chechnya"" documents the persecution of gay men and lesbian women in Chechnya, a republic of the Russian Federation. It follows the Moscow Community Center LGBT group and their efforts to shelter gay people in danger, including ""Grisha"" (later revealed to be Maxim Lapunov), an event planner who is not even ethnically Chechnyan. The story is powerful, gripping, and tense, and at times hard to watch, especially when they intercut candid footage of gays being beat up.",1
4272,"Welcome to Chechnya offers a tragic, intense and important look into the atrocious gay purges happening in this questionable region. The film needed to have more facts in it and it is overly modern in approach, but that still mostly worked as the thriller elements are successfully executed, many scenes here are very suspenseful and moving, and the movie's use of VFX is very strong and unique.",1

4275,"It's hard to write a review because this is an important subject matter. But I think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject. It was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent, graphic scenes, rather than presenting the subjects as people. I wanted to learn more about the victims, their lives, rather than being force fed horrific videos. Many of the videos should come with a warning - there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood, there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man. This to me was very concerning, I don't believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman. What does this serve, to show these very graphic videos? There are so many graphic videos online of people being killed, or tortured to the point where it is almost ""porn"" to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive. There are no warnings when you watch the film however, so I am warning you now. I would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film. I used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so I am no stranger to reading about horrific things but I try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me. I did make a donation to the center after watching the film. I hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesn't try to reduce the people to graphic scenes. It reminds me of the American version of the movie Traffic that focused on violence and divisiveness versus the British series that actually captured the stories inclusively and explained the situation better.",0
4276,"Entertaining. A sad, yet ultimately heart-warming story. A quality production.",1
4277,"This is a quite low key domestic drama thats surprisingly touching. It's about a young son, mother and the new, quiet community they find themselves suddenly a part of, while sorting out a recently deceased relatives house. The film mainly focuses on the young son who becomes friends with an elderly veteran living next door. I thought it seemed a bit slow and the plot direction wasn't very clear at first but towards the end it really hit me. Its quite poignant and I liked how the music is - not too loud and overbearing but just right to highlight the emotional scenes. The actor who plays the young son, Lucas Jaye, does a very good job, so I thought, as does Brian Dennehy, who plays the neighbour, Del. There is some surprisingly strong language present now and again, hence the rating (its rated 15 in the UK I believe) but in a way it highlights the strength of feeling about what the character is saying, when its said, so it certainly didn't bother me at all. It's the kind of film that may make you want to visit older relatives, possibly?.

I would very much recommend this film, as a thoughtful and touching, poignant watch - it may seem a little slow and plodding to some but I liked it.",1
4278,Slow burn of emotion.,1
4279,"Driveways is a beautifully realised film, a film of ample heart and strong emotion. It's a superb look at the strength of human connections. Director Andrew Ahn in just his second feature film shows himself to be a very talented artist at creating worlds full of empathy and humanity. Set in upstate New York Kathy and young son Cody are visiting to oversee the sale of her late sister's house. Kathy wasn't close to her sister, so it's a journey for her in trying to piece together parts of her life. For Cody it's a journey of discovery. Cody is smart and curious but quite shy and doesn't fit in most other kids. But he meets the next door neighbour Del, a widowed Army veteran and they strike up a beautiful if unlikely friendship. The film deftly explores concepts of loss and ideas of friendship. Without much fanfare its strong focus on human connection leaves an indelible impression. The cast is superb with Brian Dennehy, in his last role, and Hong Chau both luminescent on screen. This is a small film but one that leaves a big mark.",1

4293,I'll start with some positives. They did well to shoot and make a film like this with a low budget during a pandemic. And that's it. I don't understand the hype of this film? It brings nothing new to the genre taking and copying what others have done before it. It relies heavily on shoddy jump scare tactics which are arguably the cheapest of all horror tropes. It really is a complete waste of time and very much the definition of overrated.,0

4296,"This is a morbid yet quite profound documentary, for those not ready to face or accept death, it can be quite daunting and disquieting, however Dick and Kirsten through their feeling of acceptance, were able to somehow make the whole idea of death comforting and tender.

Dick Johnson Is Dead portrays a father and daughter's way of coping with oncoming death with strong themes on death and people's ways of coping with it.

4301,"I must be missing something here, because I just don't get the hype behind director Kirsten Johnson's documentary about the last years of the life of her father, Dick, an elderly Seattle psychiatrist besieged by the onset of dementia. Its eclectic mix of content doesn't gel well, despite some of the material being exceedingly well done. It comes across mostly as an often-endearing, loving tribute, though it's frequently weighed down by far too much extraneous, incidental and, at times, repetitive material. Then there are the picture's fictional segments in which the director presents comically gruesome stagings of her father's demise (a la the macabre suicide sequences from Hal Ashby's ""Harold and Maude"" (1971)) as a means of coping with Dick's impending passage (most of which aren't especially inventive or funny).

Thank you, Dane Cook-this is true and if you ever need an impetus for such a moment Kirsten Johnson's documentary about her 86 year-old father, Dick Johnson is Dead, is more than happy to provide as much. Made in order to relieve if not necessarily alleviate Dick's fear of death and his daughter's fear of losing him, Dick Johnson is Dead may very well be the best, most moving film I see all year. 

Seriously though, I probably cried every three minutes.",1

4308,"I'm really glad they made this documentary, you don't really hear about this subject matter or see it much in movies or shows. Jened was basically a hippie camp where everyone was accepted. And I love how raunchy and unrestrained a lot of the humor was back then, it's not how it is nowadays where most things can be offensive. You could actually learn to laugh at yourself and laugh at the world instead of being afraid of it. That footage of Willowbrook Institute was shocking. It was like something out of a horror movie. The conditions that those kids were living in was both heartbreaking, terrifying and sad. 

A really insightful and eye-opening documentary on the history of Camp Jened and the struggles but also great achievements and accomplishments of the disabled community. It shed some light on the disabled civil rights movement that was never talked about, I didn't even know that happened. It's also really inspiring seeing the change that Judy and all the disabled community behind her were able to establish for disabled people all around the world. They basically changed history.",1

I also worked for a short time in state run 'hospital' for the disabled, a less uplifting experience. The continuing story of rights for the disabled reminds us of the way things used to be in the (not so) ""good old days"", how far we have come as a society, and how far there is still left to go.",1

4327,"With two exceptions, all of the dance troupe in Climax were non-actors, mostly dancers, DJs, etc. I didn't find it noticeable, however, the film 1. Is in French and 2. Upon reflection, there were a LOT of long takes where the subject stumbled down a hallway or writhed on the floor. This isolated-location psychological horror (which is a stretch here) concerns a dance company that is celebrating the final night of rehearsal with some sangria and gossip. The director, Gaspar Noé, plays with the camera too much that it's gonna fall off. While I am a slut for long takes — the opening dance number being probably the best part of the movie (not a good sign) — the over-the-head shot dance scene gets old quick and the upside-down shot is irritating. There's a little bit of a whodunit here (as in, who spiked the sangria bowl with LSD), but the plot generally concerns the devolution of the group from amicable-enough colleagues to horny, vindictive psychopaths who collapse on each other at the slightest provocation: some sangria, a little coke, then boom! Hieronymus Bosch. There's a lot of talking here and the camera moves from couple/trio to couple/trio, which I didn't mind, but others would definitely find boring. The reveal of who did spike the wine falls flat — ""Who was he/she, again?"" I asked myself. Climax is 96 minutes, but could've been 60 and stronger as a short film.",1

I'm not really impressed with the acting, the story, or the fact that this movie heavily involved Insane Clown Posse (like em if you like em, but I have my reasons not to).

And in fairness, the inevitable concert makes for a rather touching moment. This is a search for self identity for the adult and coming of age for the kid, and cliche that has no real distinction here.

Critics who claim confusion around the faux history were apparently on their social media sites tending to illusory self-importance.  The narrative provides a fictitious explanation that is fully consistent with the arc of the story. God forbid a critic should pay attention to a quietly intense performance by an outstanding actor. The story is not about or about the Bigfoot. It's about the man. Duh. This is a character study set in a context of extremes, the context in which the character has always proven most effective.  As such, how does he live within the mundane? What has he learned from his unsung but greatest exploit? How does this affect his reentry into the extreme? Who is he as a person? Happily, many professional critics seem to have appreciation for the deliciously surprising nuance and quit understatement of this movie. And for beautiful and sophisticated cinematography.  The director deserves the accolades.",1

People grow more and more invisible as the lines in their face deepen and their hair whitens.

An older gentleman lost in his thoughts in a local dive bar would probably be looked at as some sad, lonely cautionary tale, but as a band of muggers find out in a dark parking parking lot, NEVER underestimate or predetermine such the outcome, because what THINK you see on the surface. 

The same could be said of the title The Man who Killed Hitler and then the Bigfoot..

At first glance, you've got to be kidding me right? Not at all.

Turns out.. it's a beautiful film of unrequited love and the burden of duty and unknown greatness. 

It's an unexpected film about a generation of people who were selfless and frankly, saved the world.. with a bit of whimsy mixed in. 

I adore this film, not because it's the greatest movie of it's kind ever made, but because it WAS MADE in today's spandex filled, CGI cinema. 

It's a necessary watch and I feel like I'll watch it again and again during my life.

One more thing.. My grandfather might have seemed like a meek old fell that told lots of corny jokes, but in truth he helped take every single island in the Pacific on his way to being an occupying US Army infantryman in Japan. 

An experience that started with him understandably hating his enemy for killing most of his friends over 3 long years of mud, blood and death, but ended with him appreciating the honor of the Japanese and adoring their culture.

He told me the people and their country were beautiful and that what he truly hated was men who create war.

Thumbs up.",1
4364,"Oddly enough, if you took Hitler and Bigfoot out, it would be a good movie. Even killing Hitler wasn't too far fetched and was explainable, but why was Bigfoot added? Plus the Bigfoot scene is very short and awkwardly shot. Not clear as to what the writer was going for. Some mentioned that the title implied a comedy or scifi of which the film is neither. Bottom line, the love story is intriguing alone, and it is the key element of the story, ao why Hitler and Bigfoot are there is beyond me.",0
4365,"The premise was promising, but the story fell through. The title and premise suggest a comedy with sci-fi/fantasy/historical elements; The film delivers a confusing mix of romance, drama, historical, action, with absolutely no comedy and very little sci-fi/fantasy that the promotional materials promised. The portion that I assume to be the climax left me wanting more, and despite signaling the end of the movie at that moment the film goes on for quite a bit more without contributing much to the story. The confrontation with Bigfoot is short, being more of a subplot than one of the main arcs of the film. The pacing is awkward and there is too much melodrama for a movie that puts the words ""Hitler"" and ""Bigfoot"" together in the title. The film, overall, left me wanting to watch ""Harry and the Hendersons"" to clean my pallet.",0

The film fetaures a decent cast and lots of tension. I was somewhat pleased to see one or two turn of events (a small element of humanity seemed to exist, where perhaps it may not have done). I'm not sure there's too much I can say about it but its a well made film, which I'd hope depicts the story well and indeed there's the usual thing of text and photos/library footage shown at the end of the film, before the final credits roll, to finish the story and put a bit of context to things. Not a bad film at all...it didn't feel/seem disrespectful to what was surely a tragic and very scary time to live through. Recommended.",1

It's very much a re-telling of a folk tale. I liked the costumes and I'd say its definitely got a sinister feel to it. Sinister and somewhat atmospheric, I suppose. I thought that, certainly with the first scene depicting a puppet show, that it reminded me a little of the puppet scenes from 'Being John Malkovich' - mainly as its also a dark film, both in terms of the lighting and settings mostly being in the evening or night and in terms of the not very light thematic elements.

I did feel that Damon Herriman gave a decent performance as Punch. He is fairly animated (in his gestures etc., rather than it being at all an animated film, of course) and has somewhat of a presence on screen, I'd say. I wasn't familiar with the actor previously, so that stood out to me somewhat. I can't say I thought a great deal of what could be described as a Gladiator-esque moment though. There are one or two pretty decently choreographed moments/scenes as well.

Its more of a dark drama than its an out and out period drama, although it is clearly set very much in the past. It centres on working class England, rather than well off families living in castles on high, certainly.

This film felt like it was missing something but i'm not sure I can put my finger on what exactly. I suppose it may be that I know the story roughly and knew it'd be dark and fairly depressing and maybe I wanted to hope there would be more in the way of complicated context given but that isn't really the case. Its not a badly made film, not an especially great one but I'd say its worth a watch, if the story of Punch & Judy is one that interests you, particularly in terms of the social historical aspect of it.",1

The tone of horror and comedy never quit lands ...until the 5th act where it all comes together well.  The music is hideous, it seems most of it was just placeholders that were just left in.

4387,"Wow. This movie carried a really important message on the importance of moving on from a past love. 

I think this film is great to watch if you are someone who is struggling to let go of the memories you have with an ex-lover. Especially if you dream about meeting them again and getting back together with them. But this is a great film to watch for anyone else as well.

Oftentimes we idealize an old (especially first) love in our head even after years of it ending. We recall the good times and the way they made us feel and don't focus as much on the reason why that person was no good for us. We often think of them as ""the one that got away"" and we imagine what it would be like to see them again after years apart. We keep ourselves busy of course (naturally) and move on in life, but their memory lingers in our minds and we continue to hold them on a pedestal and compare them to our next love/lovers. This of course is a terrible thing that we do, and we know it...but we can't help it. There is something so special about that first love (or so our mind tricks us into thinking like this).   

***Spoilers Ahead***

This film certainly took a twist I was not expecting near the end with the main character's (Asako) decision upon meeting her ex-lover. But I think it's an important thing to show to really drive home the message of how silly it is to think that reuniting with an ex-lover could possibly be a good thing---especially when you meet a new lover that cares about you and that you care about. 

A love that may have existed in the past is a love that may have indeed been beautiful but ended for a reason. You can't bring back the good old days...they have ended and it is important to move on. If not, you will not only hurt yourself but those who love you as well.

Being nostalgic about the past is a humane thing that we do sometimes. However, sometimes we do it too much...to a fault. Sometimes these ""good old days"" memories are honestly really simple moments that we hold so highly. For example, the memories Asako shares with Baku are stereotypical ""young love"" moments and Baku really never seems to do anything remarkable for her. In fact, Baku disappeared one night when he was with Asako after going to get food and came home the next morning because he simply decided to hang out with a random man. Baku lives for himself and ultimately decided to disappear from Asuka after being with her for a few months. At no point in the film did we really see anything ""chivalrous"" or great about Baku's relationship with Asako. Their moments together were just kisses and lustful young love infatuation (mainly on Asako's part). 

I also liked how at the end the old mom said that she envied Asako for meeting with her old lover Baku and revealed to her that the man she used to visit for breakfast when she was younger was in fact an old lover and not her husband--even though she recalls this story so fondly and repeats it twice in the film. As viewers of the film, we see that there is nothing to envy about Asako's situation. 

I find that many films often fetishize and romanticize the idea of meeting and returning to an ex-lover. As if returning to them will bring us true happiness and allow us to reunite with our true ""soul mate."" I really liked that this film portrayed how silly it can be to do exactly that. How we can be so ungrateful by living in the past and not being grateful for the people around us who truly care about us. 

Perhaps some people may return to an ex-lover and be happy, but I'd say that this is a rare and uncommon case. I think most times we really just let the good memories of the past fool us into forgetting why we didn't work out with this ex-lover in the first place. 

This was a great film with a great message.",1

The villians just didn't work for me, they seemed narrow and unimportant. The first movie tapped into the nightmare world people encounter when dealing with alcoholism (either personally or in the family). 
But Dr. Sleep? It just seemed like the villain didn't represent anything. They were just kind of bad people. 

The acting was really good in this movie. But the finale was too nostalgic. It felt like it was basking in the glory of the original and that vibe completely clashed with any feeling of horror or terror.",1

""The Thing in the Woods"" may be a simple retelling of slasher films, but Dante's ""Mirari"" is really filled with dread as well as Richard Chamberlain and Belinda Balaski. Kitamura's ""Mashit"" goes all School of the Holy Beast with a tale of demonic possession and perversion amongst Catholic schoolgirls. Slades ""This Way to Egress"" stumbles a bit in a story of a woman hallucinating as she waits for the doctor, while ""Dead"" and the connecting story by Garris have a young boy against impossible odds.

A couple of weeks ago, someone asked me, ""What makes Mick Garris a Master of Horror?"" I'm still struggling to figure out the answer and this movie certainly didn't help me, as his segments were the worst parts of this. He does seem like a nice guy though.",0

He then adds the characters and events to tell the story with many facets and nuances.  Things are rarely black and white, even the Third Reich and Communism, and the film give you some insight into the situations people found - and put - themselves in during that time and then on into the Economic Miracle of postwar West Germany.  If you liked 'The Lives of Others', you will like this film.",1

It shows it from the point of view of the German people who also suffered greatly from the war and the atrocities of the Nazi regime. In the beginning we have a visceral exposition about the racial rules of Germany in the 1940s. In the following decades we have the German survivors who also suffered countless traumas of family tragedies due to inhumanly distorted public health policies. A beautifully romanticized and very well produced film.",1

4428,"""Never Look Away"" starts off fantastically and may seem like a typical philosophical 3 hour long movie, but in the first hour it catches your attention greatly. In fact so good, that I couldn't stop and that was until the movie has passed its climax after its first 2 hours and after these 2 hours comes the conclusion, which is just too long. There is so many scenes that could have been taken out and nothing would have happened. This last hour just crashes the amusement that I have gotten from the first hours of watching. 3 hours is not a good run time nowadays, as many would just turn away from the film and never see how beautiful it is. It raises relatable questions, that can still be reviewed today. It is very historically accurate. I loved the actors, especially the Russian ones, as they were not shown like monsters, rather like all the other people. You get a first look on Germany from the beginning of war all up until the end and what atrocities the war and its aftermath caused. The movie overall looks beautifully, it is always a pleasure to watch at whatever the characters are doing. There is an overall depressive tone, which is actually pretty good, until the last part, as I have already said. I am only giving this movie a 6/10 for how long it is, especially the final scene, which is 30 minutes long. I am not saying it is bad that the movie itself is long, I just mean that it was overdone and there could have been a lot to be cut and it still would have the same idea. Would recommend to anyone with steel nerves, as well as people who are interested in history of that period.",0

The musical numbers are fine, some are better than others, but why are we supposed to just forget what happened, isn't that essentially what a musical is to begin with.  You have to leave reality a little, but to be beaten over the head about it took me out of the film.

However, things take an unexpected turn when her teenage daughter is kidnapped during the reception, resulting in anguish, mistrust, and the unearthing of buried secrets.  Director Asghar Farhadi turns what could have been a standard thriller into something much more by focusing primarily on the characters' reaction to a situation rather than the situation itself, much like his earlier film A Separation. Despite its tepid climax, Everybody Knows is a fascinating character study of a family in distress, clearly Farhadi's area of expertise.",1
4433,"This is a decent mystery film, with good characterisation and it certainly kept me guessing. It does feature quite a bit of shaky camerawork, which may irritate some. Its not especially fast paced either but I enjoyed it, in terms of it being a bit of a soap opera watch, with the viewer learning more about the key characters as the plot continued and it certainly does well at depicting a mothers desperation for answers, to be reunited with her child, with a decent performance from Penelope Cruz. There are some twists and turns present and I'd recommed the film overall, yes.",1
4434,"While Everybody Knows features expectedly terrific dialogue, strong acting performances across the board and an emotional drama at its core, the movie fails as a crime thriller because it is lacking in the suspense department. It also features an overly soapy middle act twist. As a result, it is far from Aghar Farhadi's best works.",1

4436,"Using a whodunit style mystery as a vehicle, writer/director Asghar Farhadi once again, in signature fashion, explores the emotions and drama that occurs between humans when a stressful event puts great strain on their relationships. By putting the dramatic side of things first and foremost and not focusing too much on the other part of the plot (which is central to proceedings), it means that the mystery aspect feels like it isn't quite as well handled as it could have been. Thankfully, everything else is top-notch: it's well-filmed, the characters and the drama that ensues are well-written and realistic-feeling, and the acting from a stellar cast is truly superb. This might not be Farhadi's best film, but when you're talking about the talented director, you can be sure that it's still pretty damn great.",1
4437,"I genuinely dont get how people are so hard on this movie and so forgiving on others. Farhadi is unbelievable, and the tapestry of characters and what they're hiding in this is nothing short of masterful. Seriously wtf.",1
4438,"This movie is a great depiction of how some ordinary families deal with issues.  This is a simple drama using strong acting while focusing on relationships.  Laura's daughter Irene is kidnapped and the family focuses on old grudges and secrets.  Multiple times we see how secrets destroy this family, but the habit continues.

What is brilliant about the film is Asghar Farhadi's was able to create the same feeling for the audience as the family…dread.  We want to know what happened and who did it but unable to do anything.  He left the audience in the dark, leaving us impatient.  It seems as if the movie moved at a snail pace but on the contrary, there was always movement.  This story isn't like Taken, where a family member is some badass going to get his kid back.  It's a family like us with limited abilities and left feeling powerless.  The longer Irene is gone, the more uncomfortable, suspicious, and resentful the family becomes. 

The anxiety was eventually relieved with an ending that wasn't my cup of tea…but it's like life.  In life we don't get the perfect ending, sometimes it's sloppy.  It's a fitting ending but not satisfying.  It's like craving cookies and cream ice-cream but you only have vanilla.

In all, the acting was phenomenal,  Penelope Cruz was perfect for the part.  The score was fitting, the cinematography was great (I loved the scenery).  The story was interesting.  The characters seem real.  This is a great film to watch if you can handle a film with ordinary imperfect humans.  It satisfies even if it doesn't hit the spot.",1

4455,The writing is the true villain of this story. They go in trying to be a strong feminist film when they make the female lead into a boring and overpowered hero. Too many 90s references and pandering to the audience get annoying over time. Brie Larson's mostly stale acting hurts the film as well when she is surrounded by such amazing talent such as Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. A disappointing entry for the MCU leading into Endgame.,0

There were times where the movie was just so cheesy, for example when they show brie larson dancing and singing in a flashback, it felt extremely forced and cheesy I just couldn't buy the scene. It felt like Brie was trying just way too hard to be silly and goofy, now that I've seen how she conducts herself in real life it makes sense, because she is actually very stern and non-humorous so the parts where they try to make her a likable hangout friend it doesn't work because she isn't that and can't pull it off in a scene. Overall the movie had some great introductions to characters like the skrulls, but if I'm to be honest it was more of a redbox film as long as nothing else looked better that weekend.",0
4459,"Refreshing new character and great cast, but the story dragged",0
4460,"I avoided seeing this one when it came out because of all the drama surrounding it, but I had the flu so I finally got caught up on some gaps in my MCU viewing.  It was about as bad as they said it was.  Brie Larsen just has little to no charisma and gave a wooden performance.  Her character was too emotional in her actions (as several characters rightly pointed out), but showed far too little emotion in her facial expressions.  She kept trying to deliver cheeky quips but they all fell flat.  Overall, it was still an entertaining movie but it was the secondary characters that carried it along.",0
4461,Started out Solid and just slowly went down. Was Disappointed. The acting is ok overall. Brie Larson just never became charming like Iron Man or had the stoic presence of Captain America. Instead she just was boring and ok. This for me was the biggest problem she just never had any chemistry with any of the other cast who turned in ok to good performances. The closest was with Jackson but even that was hit or miss most of the time. And in a origin story film about this character that is a major problem. The expose got way too much in the middle of the film also. The cinematography is alright. The ending gets ridiculous and way too over the top along with some uninspired Sci-Fi settings. The desert is forgetful. The music is not that good which surprised me mainly because the generic superhero score is fine but their are some weird pop songs in this that just don't work. Very odd choices that just don't mix well. The editing is above average but it felt like the film had too much too it almost in terms of ideas and as the film kept going it just started to drag. This leads to a subpar pacing that by the last 20 minutes I just wanted it to end because I was just getting bored. The special effects are just ok. there is way too much CGI and nothing really pops in this. The effects on Jackson though were good I have to say.  Overall it was just ok. But I can't really recommend this to anyone outside of Jackson fans for his solid performance. Everything else is forgettable and not worth the investment.,0

I thought Skin was a brilliant story of redemption and there is a superb transformative performance from Jamie Bell at it's core.  This is certainly the best performance of the lead actor's career, he completely owned this role and is a massive step away from anything else I have seen him in.

4477,Silvio y los otros [2019],0
4478,"Very, very Sorrentino 

Paolo Sorrentino's Loro [Them] is what can only be described as very, very Sorrentino; a distillation of his overriding thematic concerns and an anthology-like compendium of his stylistic tendencies. This is Sorrentino at his most Sorrentino-like. Released in Italy in two parts, Loro 1 (104 minutes) and Loro 2 (100 minutes), for international audiences it was released as one 145-minute piece. Visually extravagant, with a towering central performance from Sorrentino regular Toni Servillo, Loro is a thematic companion to Il divo (2008), and stylistically similar to the masterpiece that is La grande bellezza (2013). However, it's more interested in extravagant Dionysian excess than the former and more satirical than the latter. 

Written by Sorrentino and regular writing partner Umberto Contarello, Loro tells the ""partly fictionalised"" story of Silvio Berlusconi (Servillo) from the April 2006 general election (which he lost by a .1% margin) to the April 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and his return to power. Initially, we follow Sergio Morra (Riccardo Scamarcio), a pimp hoping to ingratiate himself with Berlusconi, before the film shifts focus to Berlusconi himself, especially the breakdown of his marriage to Veronica Lario (Elena Sofia Ricci).

Firstly, Loro looks absolutely amazing - there's Luca Bigazzi's vibrant and colourful cinematography; Stefania Cella's luxurious and gaudy production design; Carlo Poggioli's decadent wardrobe; and Maurizio Silvi's makeup, hilariously recreating Berlusconi's waxen surgery-enhanced features and permatan. Sorrentino employs such lush, over-the-top beauty because he is satirising soulless elegance. All-but drowning the audience in ultimately meaningless opulence, however, he does run the risk of being accused of recreating and thus validating that which he has set out to satirise.

It's a fine line, but he walks it consistently. Take, for example, female nudity, of which there is a lot. On the surface, it's nudity-for-nudity's sake. However, the lack of a meaningful rationale is precisely the point; to show that the characters dispassionately view women as commodities. Every male, and even some of the females, look at the escorts as objects to be used for profit, and the sight of so many young women degrading themselves for lecherous old men leaves a nasty aftertaste, as is intended.

Along the same lines is the normalisation of decadence. For example, we see cocaine snorted off escorts' naked bodies so often that we eventually don't even register it. This isn't the case of a filmmaker overexposing a trope; rather, overexposure is the trope. In one brilliantly staged scene, as Morra and his escorts are walking through Rome, a garbage truck crashes and explodes, throwing its contents into the air. However, just as the garbage falls down upon them, the film cuts to a pool party in Morra's villa, and instead of garbage falling from the sky, the escorts are doused in ecstasy tablets.

One of the most interesting facets of the film is how relatively lenient Sorrentino is - Berlusconi is not exactly sympathetic, but neither is he a villain; in a sense not dissimilar to Oliver Stone's W. (2008). Part of the reason for this is Servillo's performance; too nuanced a performer to allow any role to lapse into caricature, his Berlusconi remains always a bully, but he's also a man desperately in love with the wife who has grown to hate him.

However, for all its strengths, Loro is nowhere near the quality of This Must Be The Place (2011), the underrated Youth (2015), and the glorious The Young Pope (2016), whilst it pales in comparison to La grande bellezza (one of the top twenty films of the century, thus far). Sure, there's the visual opulence, the hedonism, the undercurrent of corruption, the casual sexuality. However, unlike, say, La grande bellezza or The Young Pope, in Loro, the visual panache often comes across as an end unto itself, rather than serving the story and/or themes.

The biggest problem, however, is that structurally, the international cut is unable to escape the bifurcated narrative design of the original edits. Rigidly divided into two halves, the first focuses on Morra and a group of politicians and hangers-on; the second on Berlusconi himself. And the transition is not smooth, with subplots abandoned without resolution, and characters fading into the background (Morra himself features in only a couple of scenes in the second half).

That said, however, this is still Sorrentino, so no matter the problems, there's always going to be much to admire. Very much a chronicler of the darkness behind Italy's sparkle, Sorrentino suggests that Berlusconi, and men like him, are driven by vanity and a desire for power as its own reward. Yes, the storyline is a little slack, and it unexpectedly finds humanity in the man, but it's also a Sorrentino film. And for that, if nothing else, it's worth a look.",1
4479,"Maybe as a non-italian I would have found this movie pretty boring, who knows. The problem is (well, sometimes is a problem, sometimes is not) that I am indeed Italian and I loved it. Sorrentino and Servillo together again: the best my country has to offer! And thanks mostly to them, to ""LORO"" I've enjoy every single scene.
Debauchery, money and power, all wrapped in the director poetry and the actor personification of... well, evil? 
Yes, unfortunately I have to thank that brilliant salesman, that egotistic personality, that evil midget: something good came out of his existence at last.",1
4480,"The film tries to be too artistic, and it is a little obvious during the scene by the pool when ecstasy pills are falling from the sky and the extras are trying to catch them. 

The first half an hour of the movie introduces and focuses on a character, Sergio, that ends up having little relevance to the rest of the movie. 

Servillo, as Berlusconi, doesn't make an appearance until then after which the movie focuses on him and his villa in Sardinia, with a couple of other key characters in his life. His acting was excellent but the story line, or lack thereof, really let things down.

Sadly I was very disappointed with this film and the potential it has. In all it was quite boring.",0

The script is good and the performances are good too. There's some amusing moments (lightly amusing, not big belly laugh funny but that's ok) and some thought provoking moments too. I liked the granny, what she said and how she acted at times - it made me smile. Its thought provoking and somehow rather poignant. I liked the imagery presented by what characters describe as being in their thoughts. Of course there's also some nice shots of the indian landscape - it gives a good insight into traditional Indian values I suppose. Generally I'd say it has a nice 'warmth' to it.

One of the most thought provoking and interesting shows we've seen.  The twisted humor, great acting and weird characters will shock the unprepared and will create several different levels of intrigue for the thinking man.  

It's not a comedy.  It's not history.  It's not factual.  But, you will get something good from this show on several different levels if you will let yourself get past standard shallow thinking which is an outcropping of the dumbing-down Public School System in America today.  Maybe it will stimulate you into seeking understanding.",1
4510,This is horrible. It is not a documentary about Johnathan. It is a bad video maker whining about too many people making documentaries about his subject. The viewer is left without knowing anything about  The Amazing Johnathon. I have to search down one of the films this guy is complaining of that are actually about the magician instead of a this waste of time.  Ross McElwee this director is not.,0
4511,An absolute force of nature and he will be sorely missed. It would appear that the armchair critics missed the point and should hold their heads in shame.,1
4512,"In his heyday The Amazing Johnathan was one of the funniest and most surprising comedy-magicians on the circuit. The premise for this slightly rambling and confusing documentary is to follow Johnathan on his come-back tour after a forced absence brought on by an apparent diagnosis of terminal illness. How much of what we're told is true and how much manipulation and trickery becomes the subject. Unfortunately the price is an increasing lack of focus. Still interesting, though.",1
4513,"Waste of time. Fake documentary scripted to look like a crazy, frustrating and intriguing story.
Berman, Chinn and the Annoying Jonathan are completely horrible at making this look authentic.",0
4514,"You never really know where the movie is heading and at first I was a bit annoyed but as the twist and turns pile up the movie really starts to shine. I was hoping for an interesting ending and staying true to the spirit of documentary, it ends in the weirdest way possible. The illusion is revealed and hilarity ensues.",1
4515,"In 2014, the Amazing Johnathan (sic), a surreal American ""Gonzo"" magician/comedian/entertainer from the 80s/90s, for those of us who don't know him, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and given one year to live. Three years later, first time documentarian Ben Berman begins filming him, very much still alive and indulging his life as he wishes to, as he embarks on a comeback tour. The resulting film, now streaming on Sky Documentaries, may have started in a conventional manner, but as soon as it begins to crack open the man's eccentric facade, it also slowly pivots into something more meta that ends up looking back at the documentary maker himself and the nature of documentaries and the ethics involved. To say any more will ruin the enjoyment of this film, but suffice to say, I was thoroughly amused by the way conversations between Johnathan and Berman casually throw up curve balls or yet another nonchalant revelation. Even though at times, it skirts close to sentimentalities and being naval gazing, Berman endears himself by the sweet-natured and genuine manner he confronts every obstacle, as its central mystery deepens to the point where you start questioning what is real and what isn't. Watching him turn legal requirements, such as the use of pixelated faces, into funny and clever visual short-hands, only further reaffirms his underdog status as we find ourselves willing him to win. The third act may be too cute for some, but I admire his gumption for going there, not to mention the ironic circularity of it all, as Berman ends on an unexpected sweet note and delivers a portrait of an illusion maker who is mischievous, elusive, yet terribly human after all.",1
4516,I Loved the Amazing Johnathon. I saw him on Comedy Central and live in Vegas. I was intrigued that something had happened to him when I saw the trailer because I hadn't heard from him in years. Don't let this garbage documentary sully his memory (if he ever dies). Its more about the director than the subject matter. It took me 3 tries to finish it.,0
4517,"This was less a documentary about The Amazing Johnathan and more a whining temper tantrum from Ben, the documentarian, all because another group had a similar idea. Competition should make you strive to be your best rather than complaining about how the other group(s) are ""big meanie heads"" (seriously surprised this wasn't a direct quote from the film). I gave this movie a full star merely for the entertainment of watching this douche rationalize his childish behavior, including smoking meth just to make it even more about himself. This is a perfect example of why the older generations complain/mock millennials and why I'm ashamed to admit being one, myself.",0
4518,"Watching this documentary was a completely unique experience. You will never see another one like this. It's a surreal trip that really captures some of the absurdities  of show business, drug addiction, fame, ego, death, and life in Hollywood without ever losing it's humor. It's good to see a new documentary standing alone in it's own space like this.",1
4519,Quite a wild ride! Definitely entertaining and worth a watch!,1
4520,"absolutely AMAZING movie. if you like art, you will like this movie. its for a more older audience. its rated R mostly because of ""nudity"" but its like art nude so its not really bad. there are some violent scenes but theyre not graphic or anything either so honestly it can be PG-13 in my opinion. the entire movie is in this picasso type of art style. the story has some inception type moments where you don't really know if its really happening or not. story is great, action is great. there is a lot of symbolism and the ending can be a bit confusing because its not straight forward. its the type of ending where the viewer interprets what happens, not my favorite thing but overall i highly recommend watching this movie!

4525,"Every scene is art. I'm watching an art that I don't really understand lol. Almost everything in the movie had a little detail or unique easter eggs, and that is art. The story is an art, the character design is also an art. If you're a fan of Pablo Picasso, Well this Film is for you.",1

4530,"Being a bit of a francophile, a film only has to be set in France for me immediately to be pumped for it. Ridiculous, of course. But Yann Gonzalez' sumptuous and brilliant second full length feature forgives any such fool hardy preconceptions. Set in 1979 Paris, filmmaker Anne is a producer of third rate gay porn. Her editor and lover Lois leaves her early in the film, and she decides to undertake her most ambitious project yet in an attempt to win her back. As the production begins however, one of her cast is brutally murdered. Consequently, Anne decides to press on with her project, and even when another of her actors is murdered (by the same masked individual) she continues, and begins to combine the atrocities engulfing the production into the project itself. There's so many genres at play here that it could lead to disaster; instead Knife + Heart encapsulates everything that's excellent about the genres it's dealing in. I've said before that when dealing specifically with sexual nature as the crux of a film, it's difficult to keep it interesting and relevant. As much as I love and respect Gaspar Noe for example, his experimental film Love 3D (2015) had the right intentions, but was fairly dull. The best example I can remember of sex and fetishism on film in recent years is still Peter Strickland's The Duke Of Burgundy (2014). Until now, anyway. The sex scenes Anne films throughout are intoxicating, with the backdrop of a wonderful score by M83 (Gonzalez' brother incidentally) and there's plenty of deliberate humour within them as well. Part thriller, part horror, part comedy, you name it, I would argue it's the best LGBTQ+ genre film of the year. The cast are wonderful, and I've heard some say the film dips off in its final quarter when it threatens to introduce a supernatural element (or does it) but I couldn't disagree more. It's a more playful film than something like Friedkin's Cruising (1980) but there's also a more chilling undertone than you might initially realise. The neon chrome lighting gives Knife + Heart a threatening sheen that works wonders as a genre mixer, and the cinematography is transfixing. It's so apt then, that Knife + Heart is about so many things, but deep down and stripped back, it's about cinema. Gonzalez has produced a masterpiece, an ode to film, arguing through his production not just the supposed satisfaction of Anne's art form for many, but tackling the long asked question of where the line is between art and porn. Through Knife + Heart, he makes a compelling case. 
Knife + Heart is available to stream on MUBI.",1

4571,"This movie is terrible. It makes no sense whatsoever with no coherent plot other than ""polite lady does what people want and it ruins her life"". It is not funny. I laughed once AT the film not with it. The most bizarre thing about it is, you watch the film where strange things happen and everyone just accepts it as normal, but then you read the amazing reviews and see 4-5 star ratings for it and wonder for a sec if the ""plot"" of this trash has spilled over into your real life.

4574,"Literally the worst movie I've ever watched.  So many problems.  I'll focus on the two worst issues.

The first problem was that Hulu listed this as a comedy/horror film.  So I'm waiting for an hour and a half for the ""horror"" to drop.  Spoiler:  it doesn't.
What is billed as ""horror"" in this movie is really just a vague sense of unease brought on by the character's bizarre behavior.

Now, I get that this movie is supposed to ""skewer"" suburban life, but it does it in such a surreal, unbelievable way that it completely lost me.  The characters are impossible to identify with, and the world is completely nonsensical. 
 
Which brings me to the other big problem:
The world is so strange that I kept wanting an explanation.  Are we in some idiocracy-style, degenerated future?  Are these weird pod people imitating humanity?  I hope you weren't hoping for an explanation like I was, because there isn't one.  We are just placed into a world as preposterous as ""The Naked Gun"", only it's not funny, and there's no justification given.  Worst movie ever.  Especially if you want a ""horror"" film.",0
4575,"Less of a feature film and more of a cinematic art piece - “Greener Grass” is a wildly unique, absolutely absurd breakdown of the façade which makes up the American dream. Freewheeling, unsettling, and sometimes hilarious, this is a truly original experience. Writer/Director/Stars DeBoer and Luebbe are great, as well as their supporting screen partners, Casey and Bennett. ",1
4576,"This is a deeply strange absurdist take on the suburban experience, plus a little magical realism. It's not just suspension of disbelief you need to enjoy this, it's more of a suspension of reality and of all the norms of society. It skewers car culture, orthodontics, petty jealousies , parenthood, television, fashion, casual greetings, peer pressure, news, and relationships. Oh, and there's a lunatic killer on the loose. Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe call to mind Samuel Beckett; you can read much into this if you like or just enjoy the absurdity of it all.",1
4577,Super odd movie and weird humor....but I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Couldn't stop chuckling/laughing as well,1
4578,Take the retro-utopian neighborhood of Edward Scissorhands and add Twin Peaks-meets-Black Mirror sensibilities with a dash of Tim and Eric. ¡Voila! Visceral counter culture commentary with moments of gag-inducing slapstick. SNL-gone-dark skits which tie together to form the perfect comedy for couples who dread suburban suffocation.,1
4579,"Dark comedies are my favorite genre.  This movies IS NOT for everyone, but I LOVED it.  I took it as a documentary about a suburban wife trapped in the mode of being overly polite and trying to please everyone to the extreme.  Some will think stupid, I found brilliant.  Laughed thru the entire movie!",1
4580,Unique story and wonderful performances,1
4581,"Just when you think this will fall into the ususl French movie cliches (man gets to have multiple affairs, etc). it will tug the rug underneath your feet and change direction a bit, use of internal monlogues of each character is effective",1

Os personagens são simples, mas com uma trama profunda. Ao assistir lembrei de cinquenta tons de cinza, mas só por causa do sexo constante no longa. Os diálogos são bons de mais. O filme representa muito a realidade dos dias atuais, com problemas familiares, relacionamento confusos, sexualidade, entre outras coisas. O único problema desse filme é apenas o tempo que a história demora para ter um certo desenvolvimento, e algumas partes são meio confusas.",1
4595,"Another decent melancholic gay French drama film. Even how melodramatic and over-sentimental the story is, I can't quite catch the movie's flow and emotion here. Other than that, everything is satisfactory.",0

4597,"A bit pointless, unnecessarily long. I’m sure there are better ways to discuss life, love, and death. ",0
4598,"For a movie that centers around a lot of sex, 'Sorry Angel', is remarkably safe and uniquely unlikable.  French films are distinctly gorgeous in many forms, and this is no exception, but when we have a lead character who is profoundly mean and selfish with no character arc, it's particularly hard to find someone or something to root for besides the movie's end.  At well over two hours, it's a slog.  I found myself hitting the pause button quite a bit.  There are distinguished performances and music to match, but there's a lot missing.   Writer and director Christophe Honoré  wedges in characters, unexplained, and they vanish nearly as quickly.  In a movie this long, several secondary characters could have been fleshed out.  It's clear, the filmmaker has vision and he's developed a decent story, but it doesn't quite come together.  Perhaps a little less overindulgence and a bit tighter would have done it.  Final Score: 4.9/10",0

4600,melancholy but somehow romantic,1
4601,"‘Sorry Angel' aims to become the cry of a generation marked by disease and sexual repression.  Honoré cooks his film over low heat, intelligently dosing the moments of dramatic intensity that lead to an irreversible end but no less effective.",0
4602,"Fresh, poignant but with little lingering self-reflection. Essential in its Frenchness but also delving into gay attitudes that resonant regardless of a national border. ",1
4603,"The story was told beautifully, and the acting was just great. ",1
4604,"There's nothing irredeemable about this movie, but it just doesn't bring much to the table. The story line is cliché and predictable and the cast doesn't do much to help. It does have a decent concept and the sets are pretty solid, but the out-of-order storytelling is just confusing and doesn't add anything to the film. In fact, there were several scenes that I felt would have been a lot more impactful if they were actually told in chronological order.

None of the performances by the cast were bad, but this movie is a western and it's set in the late 1800s, and yet all the acting feels very ""modern"". Down to the mannerisms and accents, the cast just feels like a bunch of contemporary people hanging about. The dialogue isn't really to blame here, but it doesn't help either.

A fine idea with simply poor execution, you can skip The Wind. Watch The Witch instead.",0

4606,"A great movie for critics with rocks in their heads.  For everyone else it is a slog with the ""highlights"" being occasional hackneyed jump scares and occasional creepy visuals.

Observations that would have been better left to the audience are spelled out in painfully obvious terms, and the same goes for the (very limited) scares, which the director somehow felt needed to be explained the moment they took place. Aside from that, the acting is top notch and the sound design was especially impressive.",0

However, Seth Rogen in a shell suit? ehh, not so hot - goodness knows how his character was allowed into a seemingly black tie event. Its quite a cringey film in more than one way and Rogen definitely plays a supposedly laidback but clearly somewhat socially awkward guy, out of his depth/fish somewhat out of water, although he makes plenty of pop culture references to try and seem relevant perhaps. There are some derrogatory comments about women, which may put some people off, though its hardly a film to take entirely seriously. The story is pretty unlikely I suppose, not that, that entirely matters. It's mostly a goofy film, a fairly amusing and somewhat entertaining watch - not one I'd likely want to watch again or that I'll remember for long but it was a pretty enjoyable watch overall all the same - cheesy but fun. I kind of enjoyed seeing Charlize Theron turn from serious politician to rebellious teenager type.",1
4628,"Charlize Theron can do no wrong and has never been in a roll that she didn't excel; and for the first time in a while Seth Rogen puts up a pretty good performance. Overall extremely enjoyable and a fun movie, although the romance feels a little like a plot hole. Still enjoyable though!",1
4629,Long Shot present its deeply involved themes in an overarching comedic fashion that makes for a clever storytelling.,1

4631,"Long Shot has an interesting premise, of course done better elsewhere where the single president meets the girl of his dreams.  This thing is just horrible, and there is one reason and one reason only - Seth Rogan.  Rogan is fine in gross, shock comedies, but here he is even way too gross in this fish-out-of-water story.  It is like Pauli Shore trying to make a serious drama.  Every time they kissed, I cringed.  Theron was ok, I guess.  She is a good actor, but there is just no gravitas - she is too young to be President, and too old to be the party girl, and it just comes off weird.  Her character is likeable enough, but not enough to save this.  If there is a bright spot here it is the over the top performances by Jackson and Odenkirk that got the most laughs out of me.",0
4632,Seth Roven in Pineapple Express is wild just like his half brother Eric andre,1
4633,Ages 17+ only (LOL); so funny and full of kissing scenes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1

4635,It's a love adventure,1
4636,"Dont bother. I enjoy depth movies which give us something to think about and hopefully grow from. This isn't it. Leaving too much out and having us believe there just are too many shit men over the tremendous amount I personally know who would protect and die for women. Its ironic I've watched this so close to Father's Day, a slap in good mens faces.",0
4637,"So end the end the 10-year-old little girl mans up a shoots the monster to save her father!  The ""Father"" was a complete waste of skin, he really did not want to hurt anyone, even the people who came to kill him, steal his daughter and rap her.",0
4638,This is a very well done post-apocalyptic drama. Tense and thought-provoking.,1
4639,A little long but acting was good.,0
4640,"the intro was unbearable. i could not listen to this guy just make up a nonsense story for 20 minutes straight. after that, some of their conversation got really interesting, and in many ways he was being a very supportive parent and trying to teach his kid to be smart. i wouldn't say that the rest of the movie was bad, but it was very boring, and the character development was pretty much absent. the movie ends without a real resolution or climax, otherwise i would have probably given it another half star. imo if you want to watch a story about someone traveling in the apocalypse and protecting their kid, watch the road instead.",0
4641,"The ""dad living off the grid with his child"" conceit is nothing new (""Without a Trace,"" ""Captain Fantastic""), but here, there is a post-apocalyptic spin: A virus has eliminated all but a few females on the planet.  
Casey Affleck (who wrote and directed the film) is the nameless dad, and his pre-teen daughter Rag (Anna Pniowsky) is one of the rare surviving females. Afraid that men will hurt, capture, or otherwise exploit Rag, the two are hiding out, camping in the woods (The movie was beautifully filmed in British Columbia) and squatting in abandoned houses. The mother (Elizabeth Moss, in flashbacks) has died from the virus. Rag is passing as a male, with short hair and boy's clothes. But she's growing, and her femininity can't be concealed forever.
It's an intriguing setup, but Affleck doesn't make it a thriller or a sci-fi action flick. Instead, he makes it a character study. There are long, slow scenes of conversations between father and daughter that will tax the patience of some viewers. I didn't mind, because the relationship between the two is so well developed.
Some critics have suggested that Affleck made this film to atone for accusations of sexual harassment that have been directed at him. I have no idea if that's true. But I will say that he shows a sensitivity in this film that's pretty convincing. His mumbling, hesitant way with words works perfectly here. He's sincere in his love for his kid, and we buy it. 
In spite of the movie's slow pace, there is a persistent feeling of dread throughout. And there are some extremely tense moments, especially in the final act when Dad and Rag find shelter with some men who are willing to hide them. No spoilers here, but things go badly wrong.
The ending is ambiguous, which might bemuse some viewers. But to me, it's appropriate. This movie is about the journey more than the destination.",1
4642,"I found this hard to watch. Many other post-apocalyptic movies are aesthetically similar but seemingly wish the viewer to sink into the aesthetic; but this just felt nerve wracking. Given what the characters are going through, I suppose it makes sense. The emotional charge of the movie felt cheesy and exploitative before I watched it; it drew me in as I was watching; and then in explaining it afterwards, I felt that it had worked on me better than my reaction to the premise would suggest. Worth watching, I think, if you are into post-apocalyptic wandering-the-West-Coast movies, if only because it is such a different take on the genre that is more relationship-oriented and less trying to be cool.",1
4643,"Thrilling and engrossing, bolstered with fantastic performances and a great story.",1
4644,"Holy Mary mother of God. There's a difference between having a suspicion that things like this happen and seeing how far reaching the global industrial complex can be and how evil. I am more distributed to be an American after watching this brilliant documentary than ever before. Not to spoil it for you because you should really watch it yourself, but there's more than one deep and disturbing ""surprise"". Amazing what they uncovered that was there to see all along but no one else asked. Watch it.",1
4645,"Fascinating subject presented in a bland, jumbled way.",0
4646,"Okay, I'm going to spoil the film's allegations here: former UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, who perished in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances (factual so far), was actually the victim of an assassination by a covert group of internationally funded Apartheid-allied mercenaries who were also responsible for directly infecting African residents with AIDS in a kind of race war effort under cover of vaccination. Most of the physical evidence is pretty flimsy, relying instead on a few key witnesses, though the implications are substantial if verifiable. There are instances where potential evidence is disproven, and to their credit, the team fully admits their mistake in ascribing potential value to them. Brügger often comes off as a bit manic, which I suppose is justifiable, though there are a few directorial choices that might make you groan; at one point, Brügger ponders allegations that a card placed in Hammarskjöld's shirt color in the wreckage was an ace of spades, the death card, and then multiple times plays a clip of himself playing solitaire where every card is an ace of spades. Ugh. I think it's largely the rampant speculation (thinking out loud) and lack of hard evidence that keeps the film from feeling substantial. (2.5/5)",0
4647,"Very disappointing. Movie about the movie-makers rather than the subject, and the frustration of which of their sources to believe (if any). So they found the wreckage (possibly) but never went to the trouble of getting permission to dig it up. That was the story, but they didn't do it. That is what real investigators would have done, but they were in love with themselves instead. Then they talked to a few people who would not talk to them or lied to them. Their final source, whom they seemed to believe, could so easily have been making everything up that they wanted to hear. Much of it was boring. I nearly fell asleep.",0
4648,"Like all of Brugger's docs so far, refreshing and thought provoking. Wish I could buy on Blu-Ray.",1
4649,"This ""documentary"" investigating the death (i.e., likely assassination) of former UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold in a mysterious 1961 plane crash shamelessly blurs the line between legitimate journalism and cheeky speculation, with consequences that extend far beyond the demise of one individual. What starts out seeming like a valid inquiry into a long-unsolved mystery regrettably degenerates into a questionable spectacle that doesn't seem to take its own purpose seriously, prompting viewers to ask, ""So what's the point of all this?"" While the film does uncover what could be a horrific untold story if definitively proven true, the credibility of the information underlying such a possibility is undercut by a filmmaker who could ultimately just be jagging everybody's chain -- and with material that's no joking matter. And the problem with that is, should viable evidence ever surface behind the truth of these incidents, it's likely to be discounted by the travesty depicted here.",0
4650,"This doc is bonkers.  The quest is to find out more details on the death of a former UN Secretary who died in a plane crash.  The journey is a long ride down the bizarre lanes of conspiracy theories and truth.  Where do we land?  It's hard to tell if we found anything out in the end, but the journey is well worth it!  Final Score: 8.0/10",1
4651,"Gesundheit.  So this is all about Sweedish diplomat Dag Hammarskjöld.  Back in the 1950s, he served as the Secretary-General for the United Nations.  In 1961, the plane he was traveling on crashed under suspicious circumstances over Africa, and this is about a film director (Mads Brügger) and a private investigator (Göran Björkdahl) trying to figure out what exactly happened over half a century after the fact.  Now if I am being really honest, I have no idea how this made it into my queue.  I knew nothing about it other than the fact that the poster looked strikingly similar to that of The Report.  I didn't even know that it was a documentary, so once I figured that out, I adjusted my expectations accordingly.  This is an interesting documentary feature, and I feel like I learned something.  Now the most interesting angle to this documentary is that it starts as one thing and then slowly morphs into another.  The material is presented over about a dozen chapters, and by the time you reach the final one, you would have never guessed that this would be the endpoint when you consider the beginning.  It becomes very apparent that something is fishy, and you have to admire just how much they were able to uncover with hard work and persistence.  So many red flags are raised when they start dusting off covered tracks, and with the number of bad photocopies and doctored documents they had to sift through, it is surprising that they were able to make any progress at all.  This is a cover-up of scary proportions, and if nothing else, this movie accomplishes one thing: it makes you wary of the government and the potential shady dealings conducted in the shadows or behind locked doors.  Now I'm not close to this material, I just watched this as an everyday moviegoer.  Being that this is over two hours long, I do think that this could have been told more efficiently.  This is presented in the parameters of watching Mads put together a documentary, and the only thing I feel that really accomplishes is that it adds minutes to the runtime.  There are a lot of names to keep track of, and I think this would actually function far better as a mini-series you'd catch on Netflix, especially given that it is already divided so neatly into chapters.  I think this is a very engaging subject matter and is worth your time, I just think that it could have used a bit more polish in the execution.",1
4652,"An intriguing, interesting presentation of a grim and shocking series of events. Lacks a nail-in-the-coffin ending, but gives viewers something to debate afterwards.",1
4653,"Mads Brügger is like a poor man's Werner Herzog. He even admits as much at one point in the documentary. That being said, he still somehow stumbles into a deeply troubling conspiracy with horrific and far reaching implications.",1
4654,If you loved the movie Alien 👽 You will love this documentary. I don't care for documentaries but actually enjoyed this!,1
4655,"This was such an awesome film. 
It wasn't simply a behind-the-scenes documentary of the making of a film, there was so much more to it than that.
So much has already been said, written and filmed about the Alien universe, its origins and its making, and although some of that is touched upon here, this is mainly focused on Alien and its place in our culture, exploring Alien's attachments to the past, the effect and synergy with its contemporary audience and, in hindsight, its connection to the future. 
This is a very fresh perspective for the Alien franchise, and with many new interviews and movie artifacts, this is not just a great film for those who are already fans, but for anyone interested in delving into the intersection between the film and the societal consciousness.",1
4656,"To be fair going into this review. I did not consider myself a fan of documentaries unless it was something I had a strong interest in.  Alien was a great movie. Loved it and watched it a few times over the years but didn't consider myself a fanboy. 
However, not for one second was I not deeply engaged in this story. So many intriguing tales about the production you never would have considered for the time period, and even today. It was all around a well done documentary and I will watch both this and Alien again immediately after seeing this. If you are an HR Giger or Ridley Scott fan this is a must see. ",1
4657,"Good performances and cool superhero-like take (eventually), but the story got lost in the slow pace.  There wasn't enough history to plump out the characters, or lateral story to propel the action.  It needed more dimension.  I was intrigued at my first sitting, looking forward to getting back to it.  Then it took me two more sittings to get through it. This film could have been so much more.",0

4678,"The first half or so of this film put me off because it depicts such a chaotic and disastrous, out of control female punk rocker type character and there doesn't appear to be any coherent plotline. There's a fair amount of mumbled dialogue during the scenes shot backstage - it has a documentary film feel to it, perhaps a little like 'This Is Spinal Tap' or something, only this isn't comedic at all of course. Its somewhat painful viewing at times, how Becky reacts when she arrives, substantially late for the intended show. You can hear the booming music (I assume played on speakers by the stage) while trying to make out what's being said by whom - its a little exhausting(!). I can't say its not atmospheric I suppose but still, confusing and disorientating are also terms that come to mind.

In the 2nd half, or latter half, of the film, its quieter and more interesting, with Becky trying to get herself sober and her life sorted. However, even then there's still quite quiet dialogue and the viewer is left guessing, to an extent, what's going through her head. 

Elisabeth Moss certainly gives a decent performance, portraying such a vulnerable character very well - I wouldn't criticise her of that. I thought it was poignant that one of the song lyrics she sings is 'I just want to be in control of it, control of it...' I imagine she feels like she has little control over many things in her life and situation (regardless of whether or not thats ultimately true or not).

I thought the best scenes were of her and her daughter, trying to acknowledge, befriend and get along with each other better than has previously been the case. It's certainly not an easy watch in some ways and it felt too scatter gun (if thats the right term?) but its not an awful film as such, no. It's not a film I'd actively recommend and it's not a remarkable film but for a film about an out of control young female rocker type, this certainly isn't bad. It's nearly a very good film but not quite - to me, this was an ok film that I'm glad I stuck with during the over the top, chaotic and somewhat unclear plot direction-wise first hour, first half or so. For fans of Elisabeth Moss, yes I'd recommend this but otherwise? not so much. I think Crazy Heart and Almost Famous are better films about troubled musicians, though I must say the last bit of the last scene (with Becky's daughter) was surprisingly moving. I just think if it was re-done slightly, it would have been better. Make of that what you will.",0
4679,"A raucous, clunky but somewhat intimate character study headlined by a very game Elisabeth Moss.",0

4685,"Her Smell is a chaotic mess like it's lead character. Moss is on point as usual, but the film doesn't quite work for us. It's runtime is needlessly long, and if it aims to exasperate, it succeeds. This smell isn't to our taste.",0

The plot sucks, the idea is a classic, executed in a terrible terrible way, effectively ruining the story of the careless, self-centered rockstar, turning it into a competition: ""Who can hate the main character the most"" .

I think you can say the same for this, although I can't say I actually was involved in anything here. I was more so intrigued and fascinated by her decisions. The film is too distanced and cold to actually become invested in any character and while maybe that's the point, that's just not my thing. Beautiful spectacle and completely unique to sci-fi but one I don't care about coming back to nor came away with anything I felt much of.",0

The cast do give good performances and I like some of the camerawork. I thought it was ironic seeing the scenes where the mum is acting on set, with actors playing her family, knowing her real relatives were nearby and wondering things. Overall I'd say this is an ok film but not one I'd actively recommend, no.",0
4738,"The Truth is a very fine film. There's an interesting story line with a clever take on acting and family relationships. 
Deneuve and Binoche are fantastic as mother and daughter. It's such a great pleasure to see two such masters on the screen together. They raise this from a rather average movie to something great; something imbued with the realism and subtle intensity of family dynamics.
Fabienne believes her press a bit too much. Then again, it's a much nicer version of the actual 'truth', isn't it? This is the version she wrote of in her memoirs. It's the one that sees her as the ever-devoted artist who puts her craft first, but not to the point of showing the absent mother and wife she was. That's the Fabi we take in while viewing 'The Truth'.
Binoche plays the mature. confident daughter Lumir who was maybe too strong and confident for her mother.
Also giving strong performances are Ludivine Sagnier, Manon Clavel, and the wonderful Clémentine Grenier as Lumir's daugher Charlotte.
It's fitting that Hawke plays as rather hack-y tv actor. Aside from 'First Reformed', I haven't seen him give performances or show a range that great film stars give, though his work in 'Maudie' is credible as well.
Nice job by director/writer Kore-eda.  3.4 stars",1
4739,"The film that, finally, made me connect one hundred with the cinema of the Japanese Koreeda, The truth remains a deep, beautiful and conciliatory meditation on motherhood, family and the traumas of the past.

4740,Excellent casting. The duos between Denueve and Binoche are something to admire.,1
4741,Undemanding family drama is amusing for having Ethan Hawke play the helpless bystander to a feud between the titans Deneuve and Binoche.,0

As for the story, with the exception of the middle act where it offers something a little different and hints at some depth to the narrative that it doesn't really know what to do with (I'm not sure it blends well with the rest of the film anyway, but it's an interesting idea), it finds itself in very standard thriller territory that you've definitely seen many times before (someone gets lost in a rural area and hunted by rednecks) and ends exactly as you'd expect it to. Entertaining enough to pass time with some taut scenes, but overall, it's not particularly memorable.",0

4765,"The fact that Steve Bannon agreed to this movie and thinks he's nailing it should show you how brazen he is about his agenda, how much he believes in it, and how dangerous he truly is.  Documentarian Alison Klayman allows former (current?) Trump advisor, Bannon, to make a fool of himself if the viewer can read in between the lines.  The 64 year old political strategist is smart, savvy and pretty awful.  The white-supremesist is using the poor and middle class all over Europe and the United States to essentially help the rich.  Ahhhh populism!  He's had mixed results, but his ideas of how to take over the world are powerful and fascist and if they come to fruition we're all screwed.  The film is never boring and an eye-opening venture into a truly despicable human.  Gannon should work on pleading the fifth, but several interesting things were said.  He said in the fall of 2018 that if the Republicans don't keep the House (of Representatives) Trump will be impeached.  He's very good at being the future and manipulating the media all for the gain of power.  Final Score: 8.1/10",1

4767,"A left-leaning film made by a left-leaning filmmaker for a left-leaning audience, which doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know 

Taking as its subject Steve Bannon, the so-called ""Kingmaker"" behind Donald Trump's 2016 election victory, Alison Klayman's documentary The Brink attempts to portray and engage with the controversial alt-right figure without crossing the line into hagiography. Seeing himself as spearheading a global alt-right populist movement (called The Movement), Bannon is a heroic truth-teller to some, a personification of a hateful and racist ideology to others, in whose worldview the only good American is a white Christian heterosexual American. And whilst The Brink is perfectly adequate as a documentary, it's limited by its identity as a left-leaning film made by a left-leaning filmmaker for a left-leaning audience. Very few people on the right will see it, and those that do will find nothing therein to change their minds about him.

The film begins in August 2017, a few weeks after Bannon was fired from the White House in the wake of the Unite the Right rally, and Klayman traces his disastrous endorsement of Roy Moore, the publication of Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, the subsequent break with Trump due to comments in the book, his time in Europe, and his campaigning during the 2018 midterms. She focuses on his European activities, where his aim is to unify and centralise the various right-wing populist groups.

Bannon is at pains throughout the film to stress that neither he nor Trump are racists. In this vein, at a fundraiser early in the film, Bannon states that Trump doesn't care about skin colour, religion, or sexuality, he ""cares only that you're a citizen of the United States of America"". Seeing the film two days after Trump told three non-Caucasian American-born senators and one non-Caucasian naturalised American senator to ""go back where you came from"", these words had some considerable unintended irony.

Klayman shoots the film in a cinéma vérité fly-on-the-wall style, letting events play out without really commenting on them (although she does question Bannon directly a couple of times), allowing some of Bannon's more outrageous comments to speak for themselves. For example, at a rally in Hungary, he states that The Movement will be built on ""old school Christian democracy rooted in the European tradition"" (so plenty of room for Muslims); he asserts that ""divine providence is about human action"" (unaware of the oxymoron); and in perhaps his most perplexing claim, he refers to China, Iran, and Turkey as the ""new Axis"".

In terms of challenging Bannon, Klayman's editing is very interesting. For example, she intercuts news reports on Cesar Sayoc and the Tree of Life shooting with Bannon arguing that he's not racist. Later, she intercuts scenes of migrants being attacked in Germany with Bannon's five-star hotel meetings with right-wing politicians. In another scene, when he insists that he would never take any non-American money, she cuts to him meeting Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui. Most powerfully, after the disastrous 2018 midterms, over scenes of Bannon trying to figure out what went wrong, Klayman plays an audio montage of newly-elected Democrat women condemning the kind of hatred upon which he thrives.

For all that, however, the film has significant flaws. Most egregiously, Klayman assumes her audience is in total agreement with her – that Bannon is a dangerous purveyor of hatred and prejudice. Because of this, the documentary remains all surface; she doesn't offer a deep dive into his psychology because why would she when the audience already thinks like her? In this sense, it's hard to know what anyone will glean from the film; the very few on the right who see it, will read it as more evidence of a left-leaning elitist media determined to crush the right; those on the left will simply have their opinions reaffirmed.

With this in mind, it's hard to pinpoint what Klayman accomplishes with the film – it doesn't tell us anything about Bannon we didn't already know and it doesn't reveal much about his thought processes or private ideology. In the same sense, it isn't going to change anyone's way of thinking. So what was the point? Why give such a hateful and dangerous individual so much attention when you don't have anything in mind other than having your audience agree with you? At best, the film suggests that he's a good example of the banality of evil – Klayman is trying to demystify him, painting him as a slick used car salesman, successfully selling cars he knows are defective. But really, did he actually need demystifying?

The Brink is a perfectly watchable film, but so too is it perfectly forgettable, which, given the subject and the extraordinary access, is hugely disappointing. Indeed, as it ended, the only thought I had in my head was ""Bannon would have loved that"". Which is not exactly a good thing.",0
4768,"
The Brink is an interesting yet disturbing documentary that leaves the viewer feeling passionate but angered about the state of our country. It gives young people ideas about how not to behave, especially if you are a public figure. The Brink gives an inside look at all the intimate details of the brain of a political figure and shows just how crazy life can be for them. Although I do think that they could've done a better job on some certain aspects, I left the theatre feeling ultimately very disgusted, which I believe was the intent of the filmmakers. 

The Brink is a documentary film that follows Steve Bannon, the founder of Breitbart News and Donald Trump's ex-chief strategist. It chronicles his life after the 2016 election and his attempts to form a group called ""The Movement,"" which is a nationalist movement that involves a lot of world leaders and billionaires who have primarily conservative views (not to mention are extremely racist and anti-semetic). Bannon is portrayed throughout the film as being determined and dedicated, but those qualities are misguided as he is not advocating for the good of the people. 

The Brink does a decent job of showcasing what a creep and how dimwitted Steve Bannon is. It catches him reusing the same joke over and over again (""a rose between two thorns"") and hosting gatherings for The Movement filled with old white people. Most of these gatherings were fairly small, the majority of them consisting of around forty to fifty people or less. Bannon's attempts to make The Movement happen, although arguably seeming successful, appear rather pathetic if you look deeper into it. The film captured Bannon's life and business affairs but I feel as though it pandered to him a little bit. The filmmakers could've done a better job of exposing him and making him seem more disgusting. Even though the film portrayed him in a negative light, I don't feel like it was enough. That said, there were some funny bits within the film that I did enjoy. It was also captivating, watching someone be so outwardly awful and idiotic on camera. 

I would give The Brink 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 14 to 18. Kids younger than that may not understand it or find it boring. There is also some language, used by Bannon, that may not be suitable for younger audiences. The Brink might not have done the best job of portraying Steve Bannon's story and proving their point, but I was captivated by it and ultimately learned a lot about not only Bannon, but what it means to be a decent American. This film opens in theaters March 29, 2019 so look for it.

4771,"Dogman (2018), directed by Matteo Garrone, is an Italian crime drama.  Marcello Fonte stars as Marcello, the protagonist of the film, and Edoardo Pesce stars as Simone, the antagonist.    
It's a story about a small business owner, a dog groomer and a divorced father of a sweet and adorable young girl, who deals cocaine on the side.   Things turn ugly for him when he is bullied into a life of petty criminality by his menacing client and friend Simone.
It's a story of violence and crime as seen through the eyes of a meek dog groomer set against a wider context within the pathology of Italy's divide between North and South, the disparity in socio-economic conditions, and the widening gaps of income inequality.  The story takes place in a run down, dilapidated coastal suburb of Naples which forms the backdrop to the story and where crime is endemic.  Marcello's deals cocaine.  His neighbour Franco fences stolen goods.  Francesco  keeps slot machines in his cafe bar.  Simone hustles, swindles and beats people up.  
The crime drama is superbly acted and Fonte's portrayal of Marcello is intensive and riveting as is Pesce's performance of Simone, the antagonist.  Pesce shines in his performance of the film's main villain.  Garrone creates an intimate and accessible portrait of Marcello, a meek and tragic figure, simmering with repressed anger and hostility, who in the end with nothing to lose takes a stand and fights back.  The film is full of twists and turns which fuel the narrative of the story and adds to the dramatic tension.  It's a complex film showing the cruelty and brutality of life in a run down suburb of Naples and the self-harm people inflict on themselves when they live a compromised life.    
Garrone weaves together many visual elements to create a dramatic film juxtaposing the narrative of Marcello's life, his vocation as a dog groomer, his devotion to his daughter, his relationship with his  dog Jack, and his social standing amongst his male friends who he socializes and hangs out with against the narrative of his abusive relationship with Simone who treats him like a dog by having him do his bidding and taking him down a slippery slope into a life of criminality.   The relationship between dog and human on a physical and metaphorical level stitch the narrative into a cohesive structure.  The film opens with a menacing dog barking at the camera and climaxes with Simone caged in a cage.  We see Marcello lovingly look after the dogs left in his care.  He treats his pet dog Jack with tenderness  and shares a plate of pasta with Jack.  Marcello even goes back to a crime scene to rescue a Chihuahua that was stuffed in a freezer.    Simone treats Marcello like a dog ordering him about and having him do his bidding like driving him to a heist and using his shop as a means to commit a break in.   Some scenes were hard to watch and include seeing Simone rub Marcello's bruised and battered face against the motorbike that Marcello totaled.   It's akin to the bad pet owner punishing their pet for an accident by rubbing their pet's nose in their urine or feces.  The film superbly plays on the motif of dog and human relations.  
Dogman is in essence a coming of age film because it is only when Marcello's learns to fight brawn with brains can he beat Simone at his game and take control of his life.   It's a provocative film whose ending is disturbing and unresolved with no hope in sight.  
If you are a fan of crime dramas, then, you're in for a treat.   Dogman is a compelling film and worthy of your attention.   If you are a fan of Italian cinema, then, you'll enjoy the film for its unique story line and cinematic story telling.",1
4772,"This Italian drama claims to be based on real events, if this is so, maybe it needed to be left to the newspaper headlines then archived.  It's a tragic tale of human injustice, the plight of a simple man (Marcello) struggling to make ends meet by running a dog grooming shop but who's constantly bullied by a moronic, vicious ex-boxer-thug. While Marcello's separated from his wife, he somehow manages to always have enough money to take his young daughter on snorkeling holidays. This money seems to come from his side-line dabbling as a local drug peddler – he also foolishly uses coke himself.

In good company, this simple man might possibly be a reasonably respected citizen (maybe) but under the violent influence of the brutish thug, and not being able to defend himself from constant heavy standover tactics - he allows himself to sink into the depths of crime he mostly wants little part of (or so it might seem...?)

After taking a prison rap for the activities of the thug, he begins to plan his revenge.  It's a sad indictment of human frailty and how others can push the vulnerable into shocking life-altering situations. It's hailed as an Award winner but like so many of today's ‘Award' winners - there's little to enjoy and less to recommend it - unless you happen to have a thing for tales lifted from society's file of low-life-losers.   Cinematography is good in its own dismal way and the lead performance is effective but a couple of plot deficiencies and heavy layers of ugliness mar its overall effectiveness.",0
4773,"Dogman is grim, dark, violent, and gloomy. It goes to show how much a human soul can withstand a certain amount of harassment. The direction is confident, the dialogue is realistic, and the central performance is astonishingly admirable.",1
4774,Matteo Garrone's crime drama about a timid kind dog-groomer roughhousing hard-bitten thuggery and destituteness for his daughter growls with gritty brutality and howling solitariness.,0
4775,"Matteo Garrone, director of Dogman, does a spot-on job of establishing and maintaining an atmosphere of bleakness and unease. The tone is the same throughout the film, as even in what seem to be innocuous moments, the dim lighting, desolate landscape, and garish buildings perpetuate the sense of gloom and danger. 
The writing is taut, lean, and gives us a lead character who goes from frightened tool to hopeless fool as his decisions blow up in his face. Sign the paper, Marcello. Marcello Fonte is exceptional in the lead as a meek, loving father and small-time business man is manipulated into petty crimes, and finally a betrayal of a friend and fellow business owner in their little strip mall of sorts.
Edoardo Pesce is also great as an almost too good portrayal of about the worst kind of meathead bully thug with zero respect for anyone else or life itself. Plus, dogs. The last extended shot of Marcello's face, beaten in by Simone, beaten down by life, seems to say so much about a man who is now fully realizing the folly of his actions and his helpless state. 3.2 stars",0

After Marcello takes the fall for one of Simoncino's crimes , a crime which leaves him shunned by his friends and community and forgotten about by Simoncino, Marcello decides to take matters into his own hands to put the intimidation to an end forever. 
I thought Dogman was a really good character study about the continuous bullying of a small weak man who eventually overcomes his fear to remove the intimidation from his life.  It's a tale of despair and hopelessness in a small forgotten town struggling to survive.  It's uncomfortable to watch, not because of any levels of unnecessary violence but the shear intimidating presence from Marcello's bully that brings heightened tension to every scene they share.  It didn't have a hugely satisfying ending for me but I guess it did fit with the cold, unforgiving and invisible community in which the story is set.",1

On top of that, all of the most gorgeous and stunning shots were put into the trailer with nothing left for when I sat down in the theater. 

Brad Pitt is solid as always but the voiceover was too much. ""Show don't tell,"" is an apt analysis here. We know what themes you are trying to convey Mr. Gray. Please don't beat us over the head with it. 

Also, phenomenal actress like Ruth Negga and Liv Tyler Are wasted on a few lines each. Back to the marketing, trailers made it seem like an ensemble piece with significant roles for these two. However, they merely blipped on and off the screen as a foil for Brad and his daddy issues.

The scenery was great and a human presence in the outer solar system was well-imagined.  There are scientific errors galore, but if I want a science lesson I'll listen to Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

4825,"Whatever ""Luz"" is...there's no denying it's exceptional...

Oh, and just a head's up for those brave souls out there who are going to actually read my entire review – here's a little teaser of things to come: ""Horror is the only genre that actually matters."" (Je le pense vraiment!)

I could spend hours talking about this movie and still not even scratch the narrative surface or give you any idea what it's about – which, by the way, was clearly one of this debut writer/director's intent. If you're one of those people who docks points from a film's rating because you didn't understand it, I need to tell you something...lean in nice and close because you really need to hear this...ready? YOU ARE WATCHING MOVIES THE WRONG WAY (SOMEHOW) AND SHOULD STOP WATCHING YOUTUBE CHANNELS LIKE ""CINEMA SINS"" *DING* (it's an Existential Sin to even mention that online fountain of uninspired garbage content, hence the ""ding."")

If you're still reading this review, BUT you have NO IDEA what in the world I just said about ""watching movies the wrong way"" or some stupid YouTube channel, then congratulations! (No, I'm being serious now. No more sarcasm.) You're one of the few people capable of appreciating the fact that art is...*what's the word....<snaps fingers>...SUBJECTIVE! There it is. I found it. 

Art is subjective. 

Which isn't the kind of thing you'd think would need to be explained to people, you know? So while I won't ask for forgiveness because of my aggressive and/or patronizing tone in this review, my over-the-top emotion – the fact that I seem to be taking it so personally while defending a film that's not (yet?) even been dismissed or attacked – should clue you in to just how strongly I feel about a short little Horror film called ""Luz."" Because ""Luz"" is an objectively GREAT film; the level of talent on display just from a technical perspective – remember this is the writer/director's DEBUT FEATURE FILM – is impressive enough to warrant such a positive reaction, (say 4 our of 5 stars or however you want to think about the metrics of [armchair] film criticism). So now you're wondering why my review gave it 5 stars if I just said the technical achievements alone warrant a 4/5 rating. Don't worry, baby birds! I'm about to feed you…

What cements ""Luz"" into that special tier of greatness when it comes to the way we value, celebrate, and commend such engaging pieces of art isn't difficult to explain or understand – for real, I'm being serious. While there is a sort of required amount of experience or understanding regarding all kinds of genres of film – none more important than Horror, of course – ""Luz"" remains *just barely* accessible enough to even the least equipped audience member, (one who knows nothing of the history of Horror cinema, or is even aware that the first film ever made was a Horror film – they don't even need to be aware of the fact – THE FACT! – that the single most influential, and therefore endlessly important, film of all time was, in fact, a horror film: ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"").¹

So, maybe it doesn't qualify as ""Art"" since it's objectively great, which would make it something greater and more impressive than a nice piece of art. Whatever ""Luz"" is...there's no denying it's exceptional.

[1]: For anyone still super confused about why ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is being referenced, (especially buried so deep in a nest of dependent clauses – hah, silly English grammar stuff), please be fully apprised that you – yes, YOU! – reading this review are long over-due on a re-watch of the aforementioned 1921 German film. Because while you go back and re-watch that masterpiece, you will not only realize how many *critical* aspects of filmmaking were first used in the movie, (things that are still so thoroughly entrenched into the accepted visual language of most movies & TV shows). Cross-cutting. Flashbacks. Dream/Nightmare sequences. Unreliable narrator(s) and their attendant subjective perspectives that allow a fictional narrative's credulity to be scrutinized while at the same time manifesting itself as wholly ""real"" in the minds of the audience…shall I continue!?!? These so-called ""simple things"" had never been done before. But the reason they were able to exist were, of course, inextricably-linked sociopolitical forces in the real world during circa 1919-1920 in Germany. The oft-maligned Horror genre, as a matter of fact, (there's that word again: FACT), was the only way of these creative individuals to realize their anxieties, paranoias, and myriad states of mental exhaustion while still playing by the rules of Cinema and telling a coherent story to the audience. A story with characters – people, to be precise. Where it's difficult to know whether they are entirely pure evil, (or far less likely: entirely GOOD). Funny, that. How ONE movie was able to not only stand on its own as a timeless classic in the entirety of narrative filmmaking, but also use distortions of reality to communicate and express to the audience the kind of things that words will never be able to explain. SOME THINGS MUST BEE SEEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD. Thankfully we have the genre of Horror in our fictional toolbox for storytelling. Which is why so many of my reviews feature a little personal mantra, or refrain that I've come to find quite useful: ""Horror is the only genre that actually matters."" I doubt any learned person in the world would have an easy time challenging such a notion.",1

4835,"Horror che parte da un'idea interessante; ma che si limita ad esplorarla in minima parte, e solo limitatamente alla famiglia centrale alla trama.
Purtroppo c'era la possibilità di aprire maggiormente gli scenari includendo maggiormente altri personaggi ed altre location.
Ci si limita invece ad un gioco di tensione tra i due protagonisti, nel tentativo di capire chi dei due sia il ""cattivo"".
Buona la scena finale, soprattutto originale nell'esulare dal resto del film, portando la contesa su un terreno più inesplorato per il genere di film; peccato che anche in questo caso i tanti scenari possibili non vengano sfruttati.",0

They also introduce a lot of really neat character concepts such as Rex and Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi. Overall a very good sequel with some potential for a legitimate trilogy like Toy Story, and you can guarantee I'll be there.",1

It brought to tears.",1

Its mainly a social commentary piece about a couple of girls in their 20s somewhat coming of age but I didn't find the female characters entirely likeable. I admit I'm not much of a party girl myself but it didn't strike me as entirely memorable...I guess I felt a bit sorry that they were clearly drifting apart and I appreciated the somewhat feministic undertones/dialogue at times, plus were a few scenes which were kind of funny, mainly in a cringey way, when the female characters find themselves in awkward situations but overall I wouldn't recommend the film as such, no.",0
4872,"The film is well done and the acting is excellent. The whole thing is very believable. The issue is the story. It a free wheeling pair of best girlfriends drinking and sexing their lives away in a continuous party at night. Then, one of them falls a bit for a guy and the other can't take it. You'd think lesbianism but it is not a consumed one, apparently. The cheery beginning full of promises turn into jadedness. I see this film as a cautionary tale of a death spiral about to commence.",0
4873,"Tiresomely tedious. I fail to see why it gets rave reviews. There are frequent comparisons with I Tonya, not a great movie itself but interestingly watchable. I found this completely devoid of interest and after 50 mins or so found myself not actually watching any more so turned off the TV. Unlikeable self-obsessed characters with nothing interesting to say about life, and I doubt the 'real people' were who they purport to be either. Utterly, utterly pointless, as a movie or as real life. Get a life, indeed.",0
4874,"Honest question.... why does every movie about feminism I watch involve the feminist being an overall trash human being ? Is that just like what the movement is about ? Treating all men crappy . How can you sympathize with a character just outta the blue cheating on her very nice fiancé for no apparent reason at all 2.3. Movie wasn’t terrible, I just thought if the characters were actual people the would be of low moral standards. I’m starting to think Alia may be like that in real life though because how many times can you play similar characters before you start to think eh maybe they just aren’t good humans ",0
4875,"I love the two woman who are the leads grappling through the end of their twenties into their thirties as their relationship slowly moves apart. Tyler holding firm onto what they have while Laura jumps into a different, more conventional world, Tyler on one end of the rope and Jim at the other. Her ambivalence tangible but she reconciles that this new engaged life will bring her clarity as an author, her struggle so fascinating to watch. Tyler hanging on to her coat tails for dear life also equally brilliant to watch. Half of me is rooting for Laura to make it with Jim and the other half thinking work it out for yourself and move wherever you're going to go organically not because outside influences dictate where you should be. The two women are fabulous so kudos to Holliday and Alia for creating magic.",1

It is about two thirty something women in Dublin who have led a very hedonistic lifestyle full of partying and lots of booze. Laura and Tyler have a a deep friendship but when Laura falls for Jack, their relationship changes inevitably. Laura realises she wants to settle down and plan a family. Tyler feels her friend slipping away and feels regret. This film is based on a novel set in Manchester but the film has moved to location Dublin with great effect. The chemistry between the two leads in Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat is palpable. It really holds the film together and lifts it above the usual light comedy, lending it a very strong gravitas.",1

4880,"Described as a modern day ´Withnail And I´, Animals works perfectly fine as a spiritual sequel to that film, but one that takes a few more risks with the lead characters to really stand behind their decisions.

The fact he played a huge part in exposing and eliminating communism in our government and hollywood is made to look like a bad thing when Cohn is actually a hero,  We need the same thing today.",0
4895,"This hard-hitting documentary about McCarthy Era counsel Roy Cohn presents a rather damning portrait of its subject, one whose relentlessness, determination and drive served his dubious clients well but helped set the US down a path of unbridled greed and self-serving interests that have not only given free rein to the power elite. but have also changed the overall culture for the worse. The film features a wealth of archive footage -- so much so that it almost relies on it a little too much in telling its story -- but its team of analysts helps to balance that, offering colorful and telling commentary about a manipulative puppet master who has left quite a legacy -- and not one that anyone should be proud of.",1

It just makes me appreciate how documentarians like Ken Burns and Ric Burns are light years ahead of filmmakers like these.  A nasty bit of work, much like the person it is about.  Hard pass!",0
4899,"Documentarian Matt Tyrnauer once again proves he's one of the best out there in his latest, 'Where's My Roy Cohn?'.  Consisting of tons of archival footage, Tyrnauer uses a heavy-handed style to pound into our brains that Cohn was a complicated yet evil vessel.  When he connects the dots to Cohn and one of his clients Donald Trump the film really pops.  Tyrnauer takes his time, but moves fairly rapidly along the entire life of Cohn.  There are talking heads who all seem to have a disdain for the titular individual.  It's another in the growing line of docs from this filmmaker that are worth watching!  Final Score: 8.1/10",1

Again viewers are shown aspects of Asian American life we are not familiar with as we see the karaoke bar scenes of Japan are also here in the American West of Koreatown, L.A. Kasie works there, 'working' scuzzy men of very dubious character, while drunkenly dragging herself through those evenings with their blend of debasing oneself and enjoying the party. 
This allows her to take care of her terminal father rather than going the hospice route. Tiffany Chu is very impressive as Kasie, with Teddy Lee less so as her brother who ran out on the family as their mother did, but for less material reasons. This is a fractured family, and we feel it. Also, you can get swept away by Ante Cheng's cinematography, which soaks in the darkened streets and neons light of Los Angeles. 3.3 stars",0
4902,"Justin Chon is wise beyond his filmmaking years and his latest, 'Ms. Purple' is an illustration at just how gifted he can be.  If he adds a little substance to his visual genius we could be looking at a star.  It's not as good as his first film, 'Gook', but it's immersive.  The ending didn't particularly work for me.  It felt rushed and inauthentic.  Chon takes a chance and uses unknown actors and that gamble pays off.  I believed in the characters even if they were mostly one-note.  The central characters lack any depth which means we could have used a few other players or the script needed to be further developed.  What Chon does next will be a huge sign as to what the future holds, but if we're lucky it will be something great.  Final Score:  7.8/10",1

The film's visuals along with the makeup and costume work of the leading character are all great. As a plot, the film's opening had my attention, but sadly this excitement only faded away with a slow and sadly uninteresting story for the first hour of the film.  The film certainly redeems itself later in the movie, but the damage is undoubtedly done long before something exciting appears on the screen. Despite a great concept, the plot's telling was ultimately disappointing to witness.  - Walkden Entertainment",0

And just as you think you might know what's up, they go into transferring genes, a lesbian scene, an island of green (and a full prism of other glorious shades), and a final battle scene. And of course, there's the fluffy puppies. Wow,
Credit to directors/writers Schmidt and Abrantes for this zany flick, and to cinematographer Anderson for making it look so glorious. And kudos to the sisters Moreira and also Joana Barrios. But mostly to lead Carloto Cotta as the clueless Diamantino and the lovely Cleo Tavares. 3 stars for general cult-y wackiness and cinematography.",0

This is a low budget B movie and as far as they go it's pretty darn great!  Don't think about it or try to figure it out, just let the absurdity of it all wash over you! Final Score: 7.5/10",1
4930,"A truly surreal picture that always manages to have a firm foot in reality, Diamantino, a title I still can't pronounce on the first attempt, tackles a series of issues in bizarre yet rewarding ways. The copy I watched had very iffy subtitles, so I can't fully comment on the dialogue, but what I understood often made me laugh, and there's some very insightful conversation into the nature of talent and how people exploit those who possess it. The lead is fantastic, a loveable everyman in the Forrest Gump mould, brought to life by a vibrant and sensitive performance by Carloto Cotta, an actor I'm keen to see again in the near future. The movie doesn't shout any of its messages, and instead allows them to pay out naturally through our heroes' highs and lows. The spy subplot might not go anywhere, but for the most part the movie keeps focus on its eponymous lead and takes us through several of his life-changing experiences. A movie that might offend the palates of casual viewers, but for those looking for something different, Diamantino delivers just that.",1

What is it that they believe and why is this shocking? What is truly shocking is how you actually portray this national icon when he stands for hard work, success and love for his fellow human beings.",0
4932,"DIAMANTINO, written and directed by Daniel Schmidt and Gabriel Abrantes is a wonderfully bizarre Portugal film where at the center lies an incredible warm-hearted sweetness.  The title character, played by Carlota Cotta, is a soccer player (clearly inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo), who is responsible for a cultural disappointment after missing a penalty kick during the final moments of a World Cup championship game.  Diamantino decides to make good for himself by adopting a refugee.  Unbeknownst to him, the adopted refugee is actually a lesbian secret service agent who is investigating him for money laundering.  Diamantino's problems worsen once his money obsessed siblings decide to hand him off to a mad scientist with plans to clone his genetics for a government plot to strengthen Portugal's power within the EU.  The under the radar queerness is almost undermined with the muddy sexual dynamics of the narrative.  The film veers into the dangerous old school notion that male charm is irresistible, even for a lesbian.  A notion that hopefully contemporary audiences have enough sense not to buy into as an argument for sexual preferences instead of orientation.  Additionally, the lesbian/secret service/refugee character Aisha, who is pretending to be a young boy and calls Diamantino ‘daddy' while watching the character development between the two becoming more intimate had me absolutely squirming in my seat with its implications.  The redemption of the film is the compassionate message about finding acceptance and love, even if gender bending, genetically modified breasts are involved.  ",0

This borderline esoteric and most certainly self-important film from Olivier Assayas is without the witty-worded dialogue, psychologically layered characters and cleverly thought-out and executed twists that we can often rely upon Woody Allen to produce. Instead, Assayas heavily occupies his far from engaging film with impenetrable dialogue and self-indulgent characters.",0
4936,"One of those series-of-conversations films that’s a whole genre of French cinema in and of itself, it follows the hypocritical lives of people complaining about their significant others cheating on them while they cheat on their significant others. (The question then, is if revenge is why they’re cheating in the first place?) Why the producers thought that Non-fiction would be a better title for English-language audiences is a mystery. The original Double Lives is more apt, or perhaps one of the jokes of the film, “Auto-fiction”. The acting is terrific with a top-notch cast. ",0
4937,"Somehow, a movie that contains several scenes of French artists, actors, writers, and publishers, sitting around a room eating and drinking wine, discussing the future of the literary world did NOT come off as pretentious. The title is a misnomer, as Léonard's (Vincent Macaigne) books are clearly autobiographical, as much as he tries to deny it — he refers to his work as ""autofiction,"" a term I will be stealing. These Parisians, as the stereotypes go, can't seem to keep it in their pants, and are all cheating on their significant others (sometimes with each other's significant others), except for Valérie (Nora Hamzawi), who is cold and unlikeable at first, but by the end is the most endearing character. Valérie also has the chillest reaction to being told she has been cheated on that has ever made its way on screen. This definitely is not the film for everyone, and some of the business conversations concerning hard copies and e-books and the future of publishing seemed a bit dated, like they were having a conversation for 2015 in 2019. I'd like to see a sequel if only to see whether Selena (Juliette Binoche) actually kills Léonard, who is back on his bullshit.",1

What does one learn from Olivier Assayas' latest?  The filmmaker needs to make bolder decisions and maybe cast someone more believable in the role of the guy who is overweight, bald, depressed, frumpy and just overall miserable in a role where he has a beautiful powerful wife and a hot actress girlfriend.  Couldn't buy it and it took me out of the movie.  The film just doesn't work unless except in it's own self-importance.  Final Score: 4.0/10",0
4941,"Non-Fiction is a witty yet wordy French comedic drama. All of the acting is great. The ensemble, led by Juliette Binoche, all delivered solid performances. The best part of the film is writer/director Oliver Assayas’ script. The dialogue is very engaging. The film is basically just a bunch of conversations that tackle ideas such as modern technology and love affairs. But the way the film is written stops you from being bored. However, the film does get a bit too wordy at times. Also, there are some pacing issues. Still, this is engaging material nevertheless. Overall. Assayas has crafted an entertaining film with interesting ideas. ",1

4943,"Alain is a publisher. He's married to Selena (Juliette Binoche), an actress in a cop show. Leonard is a schlumpy author who's long overdue for a haircut. He's married to Valerie, an earnest assistant to a political candidate.
 
Alain has published several of Leonard's books and the two couples are nominally friends. Near the start of the film, Alain tells Leonard (in a weaselly sort of way) that he's taking a pass on his latest work, a thinly veiled semi-autobiographical novel purporting to be fiction. In recounting the meeting to Selena later, it becomes clear that his decision was based less on the content of Leonard's book and more on his growing disdain for Leonard himself.
 
In case you didn't guess by the names (""Leonard"" and ""Valerie"" actually have little accent marks that I'm too lazy to deal with), this is a French movie. And being a French movie, almost everyone in the whole damn film is having an affair and maybe half of them smoke. They get together with their friends and talk and talk, never just shooting the breeze, but always about highbrow subjects about which everyone has really strong opinions. Their favorite topic is the effect the digital age has had upon printed books and writing in general, but they also debate whether it's permissible to use your real-life experiences with other people in your fiction and whether trying to win an election makes a politician inherently selfish.
 
I am of course paraphrasing. To say that this movie is talky is an understatement. Given that I don't speak French, I guess for me it was very ""readie"", or perhaps ""writey"" is the better analogy. I did my best to keep up, but in reality, even if everyone was speaking English, I would have still been struggling. I can't imagine being at one of these dinner parties. I envision myself saying ""wait…"" a lot and asking for clarification and then eventually giving up and trying to change the subject to a personal story, like the time (yesterday after the movie) that I got half-drenched (my left half) with dirty puddle water by a passing off-duty ambulance while walking home from the theater and wondered whether the driver did it on purpose and possibly even caught it on camera for the amusement of everyone back at the station. But yah, that thing about whether tweets and blogs are the equivalent of the writing of some ancient guy I never heard of, that's interesting too.
 
For me, the best part about this movie, and virtually every French movie, is that I'm fascinated by the French way of life, at least as depicted on film, where almost everyone seems to be wealthy and have country houses and tons of friends that they get together with all the time to eat and drink and talk themselves silly. While one of the characters is launching into a speech about ""blah blah blah digital media"", I'm focusing on how half of the people in the room are wearing scarves and just how would you go about tying a scarf that particular way anyway?
 
And look, instead of serving burgers or chicken at their barbecue, they've grilled entire fishes and veggies…veggies I don't even recognize. And isn't it lucky how no matter how crowded a cafe is, they always manage to find one little table in the middle of the room. I wonder, are Parisian cafes always so lively? Maybe I should go to Paris. If I went to Paris, would I be able to find the empty table? No, I'd probably just walk out of the café without even trying. French people are much more confident than me. Probably because of their scarves.
 
I'm also intrigued by the relationships French movie characters have with their children. Alain and Selena have a son maybe 5 or 6 years old. We see him briefly exactly twice and Alain inquires as to his whereabouts one other time (Selena's mom took him to an amusement park). On both of the boy's token appearances, once accompanied by a nanny, Alain launches into an exaggerated bout of giggle-inducing horseplay, whisking the tyke into the air and carrying him upside-down by his feet, while Selena runs in for a big hug as if greeting a long lost friend. Thirty seconds later, parenting duties attended to and the child dispatched to what I can only assume is a tastefully-decorated nursery, Alain and Selena resume their child-free existence of careers, affairs, cafes, dinner parties, and discussing the fate of civilization in the world of e-readers.
 
I was surprised to see that this film is classified as a comedy (along with a drama and a romance). I did emit a small chuckle once at Selena's directness in dumping a lover, but save for one audience member who seemed to laugh every time Leonard appeared on screen, once a loud chewer behind me finally finished his popcorn, the theater was pin-drop quiet. (Whenever a movie has a lone laugher, I always assume he's high. (Yes, I said ""he"". Lone laughers are almost always male.))
 
There is one attempt at humor or at least self-referential shenanigans that happens near the end of the film. Leonard asks which celebrity should be hired to record the audiobook version of his new novel and Selena replies ""Juliette Binoche"". Surprisingly, this line got no audible response from the audience whatsoever. No laughs, no groans, no walking out en masse. I wondered if I was the only one who got it or if perhaps everyone else was asleep by then. Of course, I was silent also, but I do most of my reacting in my head, and in this case my head was disappointedly shaking.
 
Back in the day when I used to go to two movies a week and felt compelled to see every single well-reviewed film ever released, I would have been more prone to recommend something like this. But now that I've become a much more casual moviegoer, comfortable with the notion that life will go on if I take a pass on movies that I probably won't like so much as appreciate, I realize that virtually no one I know would be likely to come out of this movie raving about it. It was something to do on a rainy afternoon, which is all I was really looking for. Could've done without getting drenched by an ambulance on the way home, but one can't have everything.

4944,What meat to chew on in this film! Also quite funny- very realistic characters and the acting was superb.,1
4945,I thought it was terrible. There were 3 older ladys sitting beside me at theater and they all 3 got up and left after about 15 minutes into the movie. The movie was nothing like I thought it would be. Waste of my hard earned money.,0
4946,Great suspense! Loved it!,1
4947,Visceral and real and off the scale brutal. DO NOT GO INTO THIS ONE LIGHTLY. This is a savage watch. If you can stomach horrific violence both physically and psychologically its worth viewing. Franciosi and Ganambarr are both excellent and should be commended for performing so well in what was certainly a grueling production.,1
4948,Genuinely one of the most harrowing pieces of cinema I have ever experienced! From the moment it begins it never relents in its unfathomable intensity! There aren’t words for how incredible this film is!!!,1
4949,cardi b sucks at acting. j lo too old,0
4950,Nothing spectacular but wasn't bad.,0
4951,it had some funny parts but the majority of it was just plain unrealistic... some pretty bad acting too.  JLO looked amazing so there was that.,0
4952,I loved it.they should of let us know what they do now since the year all of this happened and felt just in the middle at the christmas dinner it got a little slow.but Jennifer Lopez should of got that award!!!!!!,1
4953,Movie of the year. Goodfellas for a new decade,1
4954,It was entertaining through the whole movie and had an unexpected end.,1
4955,Storyline and good acting,1
4956,Love the story behind it,1
4957,"A mix of comedy, true crime, and social commentary, Hustlers is a visually engaging, well-written, and overall enjoyable cinematic experience. Jennifer Lopez delivers a bravura performance truly worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars. Her Ramona is charismatic, nuanced, scheming, funny, suave, and motherly all at once; though largely an ensemble piece, Lopez's performance truly ties the entire film together — from her dazzling entrance to her final line.",1
4958,"Very nice story, well laid out, it was entertaining.",1
4959,I wanted to like this movie but it is unwatchable and incoherent. 6 people in the theater and no one made it to the end. Watch anything else or stick toothpicks in your eyes anything but this,0
4960,"Though at times a bit slow, Aquarela is more a work of art than an ordinary film. There are moments on the screen and the soundtrack that are simply overwhelming and simultaneously beautiful. Often, I sat there in awe of how several of the sequences were filmed. If you go, go without expectations and just let the experience literally wash over you.",1
4961,"EVERYTHING!
Very repetitious and after a while boring- Half the theater left!",0
4962,"I don’t understand how all these critics could like this garbage. It was repetitive, boring, and felt like it would never end. It seems like the director had no editor and just had tons of b-roll he threw in. The initial scenes of the car rescues started out interesting, but went nowhere fast. It was amateurish, ugly, sonically abrasive, lacking in vision, and had no point.  1/2 star is generous.",0
4963,A little slow to get started but ends up really interesting and fun,1
4964,"Great flick, amazing acting!!!  Highly recommend!",1
4965,the acting of this little girl is incredible. won me over from the start and had me crying by the end.,1
4966,"one of my favorite movies of the year. total surprise! for fans of sci-fi or horror / thriller who like something deeper. 

Find / buy / see this movie now!",1
4967,"At one point, I actually screamed out loud. Like, really loud. Edge of seat stuff here folks!! Bruce Dern is mesmerizing and hilarious. Just top acting by all. Go see it!",1
4968,Loved everything about it! Chloe played her role absolutely amazing! Highly Recommended!,1
4969,so much fun - dont read reviews or watch trailers - just see this movie!,1
4970,"original, surprising and dynamic acting from all main characters!",1
4971,Wow so good ! Why did they not market this?  Great storyline good action definitely worth seeing and totally underrated,1
4972,"It was entertaining enough to not regret buying a ticket, some parts felt cheesy, other parts were clever,",1
4973,Very awesome movie to see about Linda Ronstadt,1
4974,"If you are a fan of this remarkable artist, you will LOVE this film!!! If you are not, you will leave with a great respect for one of the best female vocalists of our time. God Bless Linda Ronstadt!!!!",1
4975,"Excellent editing/compilation of her history. Classy at it's best.

This is a story that should be told",1
4976,"If you are a fan of Linda's, this is is a must-see!  I love the biography aspect & the interviews with her peers. I do have to say, this may be better seen on a smaller screen as there was some pretty grainy videos, but it wasn't horrible. It's well worth your time!",1
4977,"Really great to hear her story told first person. I learned a lot I didn't know about her. Even though I lived through most of the time detailed in the video. Excellent presentation, excellent use of her songs. Thank you for making it available!",1
4978,We liked how she was able to tell her story n way that we could relate. Learned how significantly the use of voice can affect ones life. Loved the musical review!  Appreciated her bravery n telling her story,1
4979,Such a cool movie for any one who grew up around that time.  The old footage is fantastic and brought about a lot of great memories.,1
4980,If you've enjoyed her book Simple Dreams then you will LOVE this film. Rare unseen footage is smoothly edited in with numerous interviews and commentary from those who were there. The highlights for me were not only hearing her sing but hearing her tell her story so honestly and sincerely. A bonus was reveling in her ability to articulate her views on cultural and social issues in such a fluid and intelligent way!,1
4981,"Great documentary. Has concert footage, as well as interviews from her musical colleagues and of course, Linda herself.",1
4982,A very open and honest look at her amazing talent and drive.,1
4983,One of my all time favorite movies.,1
4984,"It was more a comedy horror, which I liked",0
4985,Hilariously frightening!,1
4986,Dark humor and clever writing makes Ready or Not a near-perfect horror-comedy.,1
4987,A dark original movie that u will enjoy. I love the quick pace and will keep u at the edge of your seat.,1
4988,I genuinely liked the movie but my friends had other options. I liked it. Funny as hell.,1
4989,"Pretty crazy, and a lot of dark humor. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending was fantastic!",1
4990,Edge of your seat thriller and was a bit funny as well,1
4991,Funny horror loved it,1
4992,It was a great mix of humor and suspense. And I loved it was very unpredictable.,1
4993,"This seems to me like an indie, somewhat niche film but its one I definitely enjoyed. It features very quirky characters (Shmuel and Albert) who are unlikely 'buddies', to put it one way! the unlikely situations they find themselves in, relating to Shmuel's late wife, are quite amusing. I liked the young jewish children too - how they investigate things they find out. Its very quirky, amusing and even somehow thought provoking, borderline poignant, as far as discussions about death is concerned. I thought Matthew Broderick did pretty well as a somewhat socially awkward college lecturer, trying to justify what he's doing. I suppose its a little like a contemporary Burke & Hare, to a small extent. Very strange, very quirky, yet certainly amusing, in a darkly comic way.

Yes I'd recommend this film.",1
4994,"A dour dark comedy about Hasidism, death, burial rituals, decomposition, and pigs with an act that wears thin about halfway through despite its originality.",0
4995,Sweet movie.  I am not Jewish and do not know a lot about the laws. I enjoyed the bound that was created in this movie.  I think these are genuine concerns for others.  Oh there are some disgusting decaying body scenes but they are short and can be missed by closing the eyes when you first seeing one.,1
4996,Weird. Wonderful. Heartbreaking.,1
4997,"When an orthodox Jewish cantor loses his wife at a young age, he has difficulty adjusting to his new circumstances, especially when he has troubling dreams about whether her corpse's deterioration is proceeding in a manner that properly allows her soul to return to source. It concerns him so much that he consults a biology professor for guidance and expertise on the subject, an unlikely relationship that leads to a dark comedy of errors, one that grows increasingly hilarious with each passing episode. Geza Rohrig and Matthew Broderick serve up big, unexpected laughs that often prove deceptively profound and sweetly sublime. This delicious little gem delivers more than what it superficially seems to offer, leaving viewers with good feelings, a warm glow and a tickled spirit.",1
4998,"'To Dust' is a journey starring Géza Röhrig ('Son of Saul') and Matthew Broderick.  The former plays an American Hasidic Jew trying to reconcile how quickly his wife is decomposing after she passes.  Along the way he meets a community college professor, played by Broderick.  The duo form an unlikely bond that works.  It may not work for true believers in the Hasidic community, but it certainly was enjoyable.  Perhaps a bit too dark, but there is a story, a friendship and a resolution.  It certainly has a symbolism that can connect beyond religions.  Final Score: 6,7/10",1
4999,"This is a weird film. I'm not sure what exactly it was going for.. it's certainly ambitious.. but the tone just didn't work for me.. nor did Matthew Broderick's character.. which I just found annoying. I guess the humor of the piece, which involves trying to determine what happens to a body as it decomposes.. didn't connect for me.",0
5000,A must watch for indie heads. Had me laughing throughout,1
5001,"Dark, hilarious, and beautiful. An adventure movie like you've never seen.",1
5002,"Original, funny, dark, courageous, melancholic, ""To Dust"" is a different take to a very common and difficult topic: losing someone we love. These are the movies I am always looking for, and these time I have to thank Shawn Snyder, this unknown director for his directorial debut. More new faces with more new ideas, that is what this industry needs!",1
5003,Fowl language overdone.  First half of movie awful. Second half not bad.,0

5005,"What a fantastic performance from Miller, very real , Felt like you were really going through all the emotions with her.",1
5006,"Loved the performance by Sienna Miller
All the acting was very good-as movie went on it got more absorbing

i found the beginning not as strong and harder to follow and get involved.",1
5007,True to life....no punches were pulled....it seemed so close to how real families act & respond to certain traumatic family situations .....nothing & no feelings were sugar coated....it was real life !!!!,1
5008,just a typical made for tv movie.,0
5009,"Great acting, great cast, believable situations.",1
5010,Award winning performances. Great story development.,1

5013,"Complexo, muito complexo, diferente, muito diferente, muitas imagens, pouco sons, muito a dizer com poucas palavras, recorte de filmes, reportagens, animações, guerra, dor, sofrimento, às vezes desconexo, mas sempre muito intenso… 
Primeira obra de Jean-Luc Godard que assisto, e comecei logo pelo mais subjetivo, profundo e estranho… ""O mundo não se interessa por árabes e muçulmanos, enquanto o Islã detém atenção política."" É sobre.

5014,"Extremely cinephilic metamodern picture consisting of endless citing of feature and documentary films, which form the own statement of Godard.

The polar bear scene was exceptional (though bound to be a tame animal etc.). Not showing the rescue after seeing the rescuers at the  end was a good choice as well. A Jack London kind of film,",1
5031,Once you realise that the premise is flawed this quickly becomes a melodrama in the snow.  Are we to beieve that both a plane and an helicopter crash within walking distance of safety and they are not found.  It is though saved by the acting and direction along with the heroic yet clichéd attempts to save another and oneself against the mawkish thresholds put in his way and every snow disaster film.

Sure its cheesy and predictable, to an extent, but its amusing (the fact that the villain is called Mr Stank did make me laugh!) and as I say entertaining as well, for a family film. It features a new range of  quirky Aardman characters and has a bit of a feel of a mix of perhaps Around the World in 80 Days and Pixars Up maybe? not as good but certainly a watchable, um, watch. I also found myself thinking of the Shanghai films starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson as well, with the scenes set on a train in the wild West and in Asia. The main character is one that will likely appeal to most children. I'd recommend this film to fans of Aardman studio films and people looking for family friendly films.",0

5079,"ROCKETMAN REVIEW:

Man did I enjoy this flick. 😃 
Right off the bat, comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody will be made here. While I can see people enjoying a film like Bohemian Rhapsody more, I had a MUCH better time watching this instead! 👍👍 :

Rocketman, compared to Bohemian Rhapsody, feels like a more grounded version of the artists story! While there are a lot of highs to Elton John’s life, there are parts here where you see Elton overdosing on drugs, contemplating suicide, being bullied by his family, etc. This all makes for TERRIFIC drama, and Elton John fans will surely be impressed. 😍 😍 
What also works well is the MUSICAL songs too. There are actual fully choreographed musical numbers here to the tune of Elton John songs, and it REALLY works! They’re catchy, well sung, well directed, and fit into the drama! The films worth seeing just cause of the musical numbers alone. 
Taron Egerton is also frankly AWESOME as Elton John. He is SO GOOD in this, with Oscar-worthy acting in nearly every scene! 
With that said, I enjoyed Rocketman WAY more than Bohemian Rhapsody! The drama works unbelievably well, and though not all of it is “fun”, (a lot of this IS depressing) it won’t go breaking your heart either.",1
5080,A beautiful blend of the life and music of Elton John. Acting was superb especially Taron Eferton and Jamie Bell. Well done!,0
5081,If you like musicals.,1
5082,horrible. total shite and wast of time.,0
5083,"Such a pleasant watch. I enjoyed seeing behind the scenes of Vatican even I'm not a christian. Beautifully filmed. Its a fiction with two great British actors, but it delivered a lot as a movie.",1
5084,I thought it was a good overall story which allows to see that even the pope is human and can have interesting discussions with other cardinals. I didn't realize until the end of the movie that it was based on a true story as we see the real popes & the friendship that they had together despite their differences.,1
5085,"1ya- The film is anchored by two powerful, chameleon like performances from two of the veterans of modern cinema, the pair proving extremely well matched as a pair of contradictory popes. Unfortunately, the film noticeably lags when the pair in question leave the screen.",1
5086,"Mainly a talented showcase between the titular pair at their finest and most convicted in embodying religious statures, glimpsing only in their humanely flawed sins displaying modest worthiness rather than providing reflected insights as expected. (B+)",1

5088,Excellent acting and interesting story.  Worth a view.,1
5089,"The Two Popes it's two maestros up against each other. You don't have to be religious to like this one (trust us). It's warm, has laughs and the writing makes up for the simple premise. We've only got praise for this.",1
5090,Excellent acting. Highly recommend.,1
5091,"A – Based on the abdication of Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) and the elevation of Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), both actors richly deserved their Oscar nominations in 2020. It was very rewarding to savor these performances, which were so natural, subtle and credible that I was on the verge of tears at the end. Almost half the film also follows Pryce's character as a young man, portrayed by the gifted Argentinian actor Juan Minujín, who is another find for English-speaking audiences. One of my favorite films of 2020.",1
5092,"Funny and entertaining. Although following the romcom formula to a T, Plus One still manages to feel fresh. I'm hoping to see Maya Erskine in more comedy leads in the future.",1
5093,"Wit, friendship, and love. Well cast and sharp dialogue. Deep unexpected laughs.",1
5094,Fun movie with smart casting. The 2 leads have amazing chemistry and tell the very blah age old story well.,1
5095,"I was surprised that this worn out plot could keep my interest, but it did. Erskine carried the movie. Great performance on her part.",1
5096,"Really nice movie, easy watch but you do find yourself becoming invested in the characters unwittingly. Maya Erskine is a wonderful actress, never seen her before but would definitely look to find more of her stuff.",1
5097,Funny and adorable! Love this movie,1
5098,"Somewhat predictable (as the genre is prone to), but it was a nice, light break into the romcom zone.  Entertaining enough.",0
5099,Showing us that platonic chemistry doesn't exist and it is really just romantic chemistry waiting to be explored.,1
5100,"One of the worst rom-coms I've seen in a long time. I really expected to like this, given that I love the grumpy-sunshine mashup and the premise seemed promising. Instead I got a movie that dragged on for an eternity and somehow still rushed the ending. I can forgive a movie being formulaic if it brings something else to the table: dynamic characters, great chemistry, witty dialogue... this movie brought nothing.",0
5101,"This was a fun rom-com, with great chemistry and humor from Erskine and Quaid.",1
5102,"I hope more people are seeing this considering current events (like me). It paints a very raw picture about how different things would be today if egos were different, and makes you wonder who's fault the war in Ukraine today really is. It's not as cut and dry as one might think. 

Fantastic documentary about someone who seems largely brushed over by modern history. Must watch.",1
5103,Very interesting documentary movie... but I'm pretty sure that the one in the movie was not the real Michail Gorbachev.,1
5104,"Yet there is an abysmal difference between the various ""Aguirre"" or ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Gorbachev"": this time it is not the defeat of a delirium of omnipotence, of a utopian idealist who crashes against Nature and its indomitable laws, but of a statesman who was demonstrating how the Leninist way to a ""human"" communism was viable, so much so that the conservative forces dismissed him with a putsch. The ""repubblichino"" Ezio Mauro plays dumb denying the historical and macroeconomic evidence: the fall of the Wall in '89 was only a consequence of the multiple reforms carried out during his secretariat from 1985 to 1991. Growing up in a kolkhoz, he had learned to increase the purchasing power not by raising incomes, salaries and wages (see Landini and today's false left), but by keeping prices down and therefore the cost of living. The variables to modify the gap between rich and poor are 2, and a left that is truly such acts on the second, not on the first one. 
(Mauro Lanari)",1
5105,A poor film when it comes to a man like Werner Herzog. Nothing exceptional in particular.,0
5106,"This documentary is one of the most important historical records of our time. Every school child in the United States (and their parent) should be required to watch. I remember these events and the U.S. press got it all wrong, preferring to elevate Reagan rather than take the opportunity for world peace. Reagan's legacy should be tarnished by this reality check. What a disgusting display of opportunism. The film also reveals the contrast between the humble home life of Gorbachev (as they visit his garden) and the gross opulence that surrounds U.S. politicians.",1
5107,"Gorbachev is fundamentally an interesting character study - raised in the tumult of the Second World War in unremarkable circumstances, gradually rising to prominence on the back of reforms and internal changes, before overseeing one of the world's largest countries dissolve in the midst of substantial internal and external conflict. Too moderate for the conservative nationalists despite the efficacy of his international efforts, too Soviet for the rest of the world to really embrace, undeniably intelligent. But Herzog's attempt to document his rise, the balance of his success and failures, feels too sanitized, as if an old USSR review board had final cut approval. Still, the actual interview footage stands out among the otherwise relatively conventional documentary material, offering an often candid portrayal of a figure who inhabited a unique role in 20th century history. (3/5)",0
5108,Lessons from a man most politicians should learn from.,0
5109,"MEETING GORBACHEV is one of very few documentaries that actually falls a little short of my hopes and expectations for the content it provides and its quality. The archival footage used and the interviews do offer sufficient valuable insight, but I do feel the production (particularly the interviews themselves) has no enhancing or engaging elements to make this better than a stock-standard TV documentary.",0
5110,"I'm not much into politics, but I'm indeed into Herzog. Here his sits down with the last President of the Soviet Union and have a chat about everything from his childhood, the love of his life and political wins and downers. Interesting guy, and a nice interview but it fails to interest me.

One of the guys poorest, recent documentaries for me - but that's mostly a matter of the topic and not the film as a product. Sorry, Herzie, but I still love you.

5.5 out of 10 Presidents.",0
5111,"A candid recollection of Gorbachev's memories and opinions about the Soviet Union. He is one of the few people in the USSR who was legitimately kind-hearted, well-intentioned and wanted what's better for everyone, with or without communism.

5112,"So clever, sexy, smart, and passionate--just like Emily Dickinson herself. Forget that pretentious, boring, confusing Tar, watch this delightful, insightful gem instead!!",1
5113,"This is a delightful film - tender, amusing, quite a light and fun watch. I liked that lines of Emily's poetry is displayed on screen. The relationship between Emily and Susan puts things in context. it is somewhat thought provoking, though I believe it isn't intended to be an entirely accurate/faithful period film but that didn't bother me - the themes are well conveyed. I enjoyed the piano pieces played throughout that feature in the background but don't make it difficult to hear the dialogue, thankfully. 

I enjoyed this film and would certainly recommend it to others, yes.",1
5114,"Absolutely hilarious! I think I laugh more than I should. It isn't any historical period drama that had those heavy, intense scenes and moments. I've watched a video that talks about Emily Dickinson and how this movie portrays her life in the way it should.",0
5115,"Wild Nights with Emily (2018), written and directed by Madeleine Olnek, is a biographical comedic dramatization of the life of 19th century American poet Emily Dickinson.  It shines a light on her life as a writer, her pursuit of success to become a published poet, and her romantic relationship with Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson which dispels the literary myth that she was unloved and lived a life as a reclusive spinster.    Molly Shannon plays the adult Emily and Susan Ziegler plays the adult Susan.   Amy Seimetz plays Mabel Todd, Austin's mistress, and the first person to publish her poetry.  Jackie Monahan plays the Adult Lavina and Kevin Seal plays the Adult Austin.    Dana Melanie plays the Young Emily, and Sasha Frolova plays the Young Susan.   Allison Lane plays the Widow Kate.   Lisa Haas plays Maggie, the maid.   Robert McCaskill plays Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Brett Gelman plays Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

The film follows a non-linear structure.  Olneck juxtaposes the narrative of Emily's romantic relationship with her childhood friend Susan Huntington Gilbert who eventually goes on to marry her brother Austin and live next door against the narrative of Mabel Todd's version of Emily's life as she tells it during a talk at the Ladies Rotary Club Auxiliary celebrating the publication of Emily's poetry.    As adult women, Emily and Susan steal passion when they can and keep up a daily correspondence with Susan encouraging and inspiring Emily with her poetry.  Emily's brother Austin never suspects but Susan's children seem to have an inkling especially Martha Dickinson.

Olnek has woven together many visuals elements including narration, diverse angle shots, superimposed images, juxtaposition of interior/exterior shots, editing techniques, and the filmification of Emily's poetry to create a refreshing and intriguing film which puts aside preconceived notions of her life as a spinster, a recluse who never left her room.   The motif of romance and intimacy between Emily and Susan and to a lesser degree between Austin and Mabel stitch the film into a cohesive structure.  The film is peppered with comedic moments and touches of slapstick comedy which gives the film a ""je ne sais quoi"" feel.  The opening shot of the two sisters-in-law greeting each other in the homestead parlor which turns into an embrace and then, a romp sets the tone for the film.  Shannon is marvelous to watch as is Ziegler.  Shannon gives a poignant portrayal of the head strong, irreverent, intelligent, and talented poet.   Ziegler shines in her performance as Emily's romantic love interest.  Their performances allow us to empathize with their characters and experience the narrative of their romantic relationship.

The visuals reveal much about Emily's life and the enduring and loving relationship she shared with her childhood friend Susan.  There are many tender and touching scenes in the film and one of the loveliest and sweetest is seeing the adult Emily hoist down a basket of freshly baked bread from her bedroom window to a group of appreciative and smiling young children, and than, seeing the same children revisit the spot under different circumstances.  There are many comedic moments in the film which are cleverly done and a hoot to watch especially seeing Shannon's face as she hosts Judge Lord and listens to his rendition of the Bronte novels, or when she catches a glimpse of Ralph Waldo Emerson from a doorway.  Another comedic highlight in the film is the scene between Austin Dickinson and Lavinia Dickinson.  Austin impresses on his sister to force an introduction between Mabel Todd and Emily.  Lavinia suggests she substitute her cat who happens to be called Emily Dickinson.  One of the most moving and heart wrenching scenes in the film is seeing the adult Susan prepare Emily's body for burial.   

There's so much to recommend the film.  It retells the poet's life in a bold and beautiful way and shatters preconceived notions about her spinster life, and her character.  It's a film that celebrates the bonds of love between two women whose relationship found a way to thrive despite the constraints and conventions of 19th century American society.   I am fan of period films about literary characters and this film went beyond my expectations for its refreshing take on Emily Dickinson's life.   It's superbly acted, well-written, and beautifully shot .  Olnek has succeeded in shattering the ""lily white"" image of Emily Dickinson and creating an authentic portrait of the true Emily Dickinson.   If you are a fan of period pieces, you'll love Wild Nights with Emily.  If you are a fan of Molly Shannon, you'll love her in her brilliant performance of the poet.  If you are a fan of the poet Emily Dickinson, you'll love the film for its authentic re-telling of her life.   Do see it for you won't be disappointed.",1
5116,"I enjoyed this film.  I like Molly Shannon and the type of humor she presents.  The numerous Emily Dickinson stories are wearing a little thin, but this comic treatment made the retelling interesting.",0
5117,"Loved all the research that went into this, though it definitely takes its liberties. Lavinia is the true mvp, best scene is when she suggests they introduce Mabel Todd to Emily Dickinson the cat instead of the human.",0
5118,"Something about the line delivery didn't work for me. The actors seemed to be deliberately reading the lines like high school students might read a play aloud in class. I can see what they were going for with that, maybe, but it didn't work for the movie. If I didn't already know a little bit about this story, I'd have been confused by the jumping around between time periods. For a fresher, more irreverent look at Emily Dickinson's young life, check out Apple TV's Dickinson series.",0
5119,It often seemed like the actors were reading their lines for the first time and trying hard not to laugh.,0
5120,"Hubby has seen a lot of these Emily Dickinson biopics over the years and the way Dickinson is portrayed here is the antithesis of anything you've seen.  If this is your first dealing with one, like it was for my wife, then you may be better off.  Even if this is 100% real, the film just wasn't funny.  It's a comedy filled with long stretches of time where we were both bored.  Molly Shannon is acting the heck out of this, but we're talking a great comedic actress in a comedy where she doesn't make you laugh.  For us that adds up to a miss.  And if this is the TRUE Emily Dickinson story (the press packet had citations to facts), then YOU GO GIRL!! Final Score: Hubby: 4.2/Wife: 5.6 Average: 4.9/10",0
5121,"So glad this movie was made! It's laugh-out-loud funny and an important window into what we had been taught about Emily Dickinson in years past and why. Thank you Madeleine Olnek and everyone involved for the great writing, casting, acting and everything else!",1
5122,Thoughtful and well act d,1
5123,Difficult subject handled really well. One scene was too on the nose but it was held up by a stellar from Octavia Spencer.,1
5124,"Very well thought of movie...however, the ending was rushed and left you hanging! Would have been a great story if they worked on a better ending!",1
5125,The acting was superb and the story engrossing.  I really enjoyed the movie tremendously.  Just unsure of the ending and would like to hear what others thought it meant.,1
5126,"A great story and great acting. Octavia Spencer deserves another Oscar for this one. The young man playing Luce was amazing as well. The movie constantly makes you teeter the line of who is telling the truth and who is lying. It was a roller coaster of a ride and it keeps you thinking about race, stereotypes, etc for days after.",1
5127,"Small, Powerful Character-Driven Drama which leads you in a Surprising way! You think its one thing but it goes in a different direction & thats a Good thing! Excellent Performances.",1
5128,"Tim Roth’s British accent leaked through his American character at times. A little disappointing that Kelvin Harrison, Omar Brunson, Andrea Bang and Brian Bradley are still playing high school kids at 24-25 years old. Dialogue felt forced and stilted at times showing the movie’s stage origins",1
5129,Strange ending. Left guessing who was the monster.,1
5130,"Nothing novel about this movie.  Sure, it put me on the edge of my seat the whole time (and I was in a super comfy theater recliner), only because I was edging to leave the seat itself and to leave the movie and request a credit for a different movie.  Suspenseful? HA!  Psychological thriller? You must be kidding me!  Logical script?  Not a chance!  It was literally dull and boring to the modern intellectual movie goer! Buyer Beware! :-)",0
5131,This movie really made us think and discuss the characters and motivations. We kept coming back to it the next day in conversation.  I hope there will be a Luce 2.,1
5132,"Notting Hill crossed with Jeanne Dielman, with all the joy of the later and the depth of the former.",0
5133,Convince me Right Now ..Why this is NOT the best Film I have ever seen ..kid u not ..PERFECTION ..absolute Perfection,1
5134,"This is very much a subtle and arty kind of a film. The scenes move slowly and its mainly a sort of depiction of the main characters sense of personal isolation and their ability to open up to one another, thus its about secrets and trust to a if but small extent. I can certainly understand why some may feel this is a bit bland and dull - its not the sort of film that exactly grabs you visually, its safe to say. This will only really appeal if your ok with dialogue heavy and perhaps introspective type films, I'd have thought.  There is a fair bit of talk about film, i.e. film analysis, although its a drama rather than a documentary, of course.

I can also see why its regarded by some as rather self indulgent. I thought it was ok, slightly good and perhaps thought provoking but not entirely captivating. Its a thoughtful watch which won't appeal to all but for what it is, its ok.",0
5135,"Many frames look like paintings in this movie, but nothing remarkable though, nor anything revolutionary. The story is quite simple in itself, however we don't get much access to the characters' feelings, what a shame ! Music is used quite poorly even though it is nearly absent from the movie",0
5136,"A very poor bored movie that really doesn't say all that much.  If you have an hour and a half to kill, this movie might just be for you, but it wasn't for me, which is why I rate it *1* stars!!",0
5137,"Hogg paints what she knows; clipt, brooding, beautiful aristocrats who know their rules and the need for secrets, stiff upper lip and the need to quietly stray. Here two bright young things find their way in life and to a neatly suppressed authentic voice. Hogg makes the clearly autobiographical point through Julie, joining film school, aspiring to give authentic voice to the people of Sunderland she's never met (but has photographed some art conceptual work there), and sets up this pretence to be ridiculed. Julie's counterpoint is Anthony, who knows who he is and his voice. Dressed in a wonderful heirloom dressing gown, perfect suits, bow ties and cuff links at all times; he's foreign office old school with a proper old school habitual heron addiction, as one does; a Patrick Melrose for the diplomatic corps. The heroin provides the mild tragedy in this otherwise comforting world, a world where Julie's film teacher knows she doesn't have to think about budgets. It's beautiful, arrogant and libertarian; who doesn't want to be found passed away in the toilets by the Wallace Collection?",1
5138,Pretentious twaddle.  The whole thing is just very beige - nobody says or does anything interesting.  The courting couple are unconvincing - why would anyone be interested in them?  They just mumble a lot of the sort of pseudo-intellectual piffle that you'd be unlucky to hear at a 'stayed-up-all-night-first-year-of-uni' experience.  Very tedious.,0
5139,"Some beautiful, heartwarming moments but ultimately a movie that misses making an impact. An anticlimactic story with a promising premise. Hogg clearly made this to be autobiographical in nature. I'm sure it's meaningful to her but not to the world. I would pass",0
5140,Tiresome cliché. Excruciating and obvious script coupled with awkward acting makes this movie one to remember for all the wrong reasons.,0
5141,"God awful. Director Joanna Hogg presents a pretty but stunningly dull and dreary autobiographical coming-of-age story about a privileged film student trying to make meaningful film about real people and, instead, becoming involved with a male friend/lover who consumes her life. The director seems to have come to believe her own story, in the end, has worth but she fails to persuade the viewer. The supposedly charismatic, irresistible man, played by Tom Burke, is an unappealing sad sack always borrowing money, blaring his opera through the apartment and tearing down the talent of the film student while seemingly doing nothing of value himself. There certainly could have been some material here to make the audience empathetic to the protagonist but instead it comes off as a pretentious film experiment (improv can work but is completely inane in this case) that she should have kept to herself and her group of pretentious film friends. And there is a sequel???!!! God no.",0
5142,How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a film that will leave you with a heart wrenched feeling and tears dropping down your cheeks. At first you might feel sour but it reveals its-self that this is the best closing to the HTTYD trilogy that we were going to get from DreamWorks.,1
5143,Best of Movies/TV Series Collection,1

5148,a beatiful end to the httyd series im glad dreamworks didn't milk the series until it became a simpsons sydrome hiccup and and toothless realise that as long as humans like grimel are still alive even if grimel himself is dead people will still threaen the dragon so they have to say goodbye but at the same time remain apart of eachothers lives,1
5149,Amazing. Recommend watching.,1

I LOVED THE WAY IT ENDED OMGGGGGG!! I thought at first, the dragons were going to the Hidden world and they'd never see them again, I was so SAD!! But then when they see eachother again, years later and they both have kids, YAYYY!!! Was just awesome!! The whole movie was GREATTTT!! I love ALL 3 of them and all the series and everything about this!! My son and I read the books together when he was a kid and we were just chuffedddddd when they movies came out!!",1

5163,"It was okay, but could have been way better.",0
5164,"Aside from the Batman films, ""Shazam"" is hands down the best film adopted from DC Comics this century (and I can appreciate the argument for Shazam over the Batman films). This movie is a pure joy, much like like the Tom Hanks movie ""Big"", of which this is really a superhero version. Heartwarming, yet not so gooey sweet to lose the superhero-ness of the film. Live action superhero films need to pass the realism test, and this one does. Best of all, it reminds us older guys what it was like to be a young kid, but in a really weird situation which none of us ever experienced. Just watch it, ok?",1
5165,"it's a fine movie but didn't feel like a movie enough, it was more like a tv thing, just not cinematic enaugh, liked the horror moments the more and i feel like that tune would've suited better, i just don't thing magic blend very well with chezzy, funny and pop type style or whatever you call it",0
5166,"The humor all throughout this movie and what they chose to do with the boy/hero transitions was very creative, plus introducing his foster housemates into the action toward the end. The villain was slightly hollow but I did like some parts of his backstory. I liked what they did with Billy's foster home friend throughout the film too and I think he made a good supporting character when it came to him discovering his abilities and turning into Shazam! Plus, a strong emotional angle was added to the movie with the protagonist's mother abandoning him as well which made a heart string-tugging twist. This is definitely one of the funniest and fun DC films!",1
5167,One of the better justice league movies to date,1
5168,Great for kids yearly. Fun and entertaining. Niece loved it.,1
5169,ShaZam real name in the comic books . Captain Marvel. The good old days when Superhero's FIGHT more than making jokes on film,1

5171,"To me, it was just OK. There was nothing memorable or exciting about the movie. The acting was flat. The antagonist didn't have a strong motivation for me to care about.",0
5172,It was good action. There were many scenes which had my heart pounding!,1
5173,The performances were great and the cinematography was just outstanding.,1

5191,The best spiderman so fast!,1
5192,Great movie and the lighter side of the mideast crisis...,1
5193,"Tel Aviv on Fire is a superb film.  I think that it has taught me more about the fraught Israeli/Palestinian nightmare than anything else that I have read or come into contact with.  The acting is superb (and how about the dreamboat Israeli commander Yehuda!!!, the dialogue is sharp & pointed, and the message resonates deeply.  Or as the main character (can we call him a hero?) says:  'Is there something between surrender & bombs?' //. The writers & directors are to be deeply commended for allowing our hearts to be moved, using humor & 'real life' to enter into a political morass.",1
5194,"PERFECT SUMMER FILM!  A comedy, drama, and soap opera, dusted with authenticity and tucked into 100 mins of pure entertainment.",1
5195,My favourite documentary!,1
5196,Nice little story about trying to farm and doing what everyone tells you can’t do,1
5197,"Calling this the world's greatest documentary would not be much of an exaggeration. It is singularly intellectual, common sense, heart-warming and hope for the future. I love this couple and their ideals. Can this filmmaker run for president of the world and spread his goodness throughout. Why does it seem that the world is unfortunately not made up of more people like this?",1
5198,I thought it was very good and interesting to see how they made the animals and habitat all work together over a 7 year period. If only we could apply what they learned to the real world and find some balance in the environment,1
5199,"It's a beautifully shot film about two very privileged people who, appallingly, decide to farm when they know absolutely nothing about farming. Apparently the glossy cinematography has allowed many viewers to overlook what they are actually watching. He is chasing coyotes to their deaths, leaving infected animals untreated, letting his chickens be massacred on a nightly basis, and shooting ill animals in the head before he's even sought treatment. My parents are vets in the LA area and I've spent a good deal of time on farms where people actually care for their animals. I can assure you that this is not normal. I was so excited to watch this movie, but now I wish I could unsee it.  And what is going to happen to their ""perfectly crafted"" ecosystem when the water runs out? It's California--we're in a perpetual state of drought, and wells and aquifers don't last forever. The water will run out.",0
5200,Very inspirational movie. I appreciate how their personal story on the small piece of land is a mirror for the larger world and how we are treating out natural environment. I can't imagine how anyone would not find this movie both enjoyable and reflective.,1
5201,"Well done, all around.  This is one of the most important films of all time, and as an added bonus, it's fun to watch.  You will come away a better person for the watching of it, with the knowledge of why our approach to meeting our needs must change in the same direction.",1
5202,A revived way of farming that includes the ups and downs of the trade. Great show for families and if you want a warm happy feeling afterwards.,1
5203,Great show to watch with the whole family,1
5204,A fantastic presentation of a remarkable story on a number of levels.  Highly recommended for all but particularly for children.,1
5205,"This is a somewhat subtle and understated film about a middle aged woman living in the LA, who expresses herself via visits to the local dance/nights clubs, which lead to a number of relationships. It may make you think about how society judges and reacts to people who don't have too much to tie themselves down to. It features a good performance from Julianne Moore as the titular character and I enjoyed the music played in certain scenes - there are some decent disco tunes played, for one. I think this film is good from a feminist point of view, depicting a woman who is quite determined to live life her own way, though 'empty nest syndrome' does play a role in this film. I suppose you could say its about detachment perhaps?. Plot wise it seemed a little slow perhaps and possibly somewhat directionless in the first half of the film maybe, though that may be being a bit harsh but otherwise I would gladly recommend this film. I think it's good that Hollywood are depicting such tales.",1
5206,"Una mujer fantástica Gloria, es la enseñanza clara que no hay edades para poder decir claramente que Yo prefiero bailar sola.",1
5207,"Interesting movie, with a robust story and good acting",1
5208,"Incorrectly described on here as a romantic comedy.  No, if you enjoy depressing realism you'll enjoy this.",0
5209,"As a woman in my mid fifties, I would have to say Diane nailed this as an actress and producer! ",1
5210,"La straordinaria sensualità e l'ancor più incredibile talento di Julianne Moore sono uno spettacolo per gli occhi e per il cuore.
Purtroppo il remake non ha una sceneggiatura in grado di emozionare come la sua protagonista; si capiscono i suoi stati d'animo ma non si riesce a fare un ulteriore passo cercando qualcosa oltre.
Per giunta i personaggi che girano intorno a ""Gloria"" sono zelanti, problematici e poco interessanti.
Tutto quello che riguarda la Moore è buono grazie a lei, il resto è noia.",0
5211,"I like Julianne Moore & John Turturro, but they sometimes make poor choices of films in which to be involved.  This was one of those.  Don't bother.  It was a sadish story and told in a rather mundane manner.",0
5212,"This was a ""stuck on a plane for the next 6 hours"" film for me, otherwise I would've never watched it all the way through. After viewing it, I really started to question how airlines pick these films, as this one went nowhere, except you get to see Julianne Moore's breasts while she's read poetry. So, if that's what you were looking for...Lo and behold! This film is for you, and that's about all you'll get out of it, because the dialogue stares longingly at itself through its own a@#hole, and plays like an immature art school brat production.

The draw here for me was John Turturro, as his character was loaded with agony due to the relationship with his wife and his daughters. I kept watching because his character's story had me intrigued, and it went nowhere. I was disappointed, although--again, he does read poetry to Julianne Moore's breasts, and the conversation is deep while her breasts are out. So...it's not the best movie to watch on a plane, because your neighbor can't really hear the poetry, but they can see you watching Julianne Moore's breasts.",0
5213,"Not Good.  Despite everyone's acting best efforts it is simply not a very good movie.  If one watches another person's boring life struggle for 2 hrs there has to be some message, some purpose, some reason, some redeeming conclusion at the end, some lesson to be learned or taken away which would justify our suffering.  Regretfully there is not.  Who greenlights this stuff and why?  Who when they read this idea or screenplay said 'Yes, that would make an entertaining movie'?  I'm perplexed and so is just about everyone who sat through it.",0
5214,A subtle masterpiece. The filmmaker brilliantly captures the mid life experience. Julianne Moore is transcendent. John Tuturro is wonderful. Great cast. Great film.,1
5215,A frightening reality; wonderfully told.,1
5216,Spectacular film.  'Forever chemicals' should never be the price humans pay for money and jobs.  Get ready to throw out your Teflon cookware.,1
5217,It is an eye opener!,1
5218,Mark Ruffalo was amazing.  Disturbing real-life drama.,1
5219,Compelling ! Especially living here in Parkersburg our whole lives !,1
5220,IT WAS WELL DONE. GREAT ACTORS AND ACTING,1
5221,Very informative. Heart wrenching. So glad to have started the year seeing this film.,1
5222,Mark was great a few slow scenes but great with an amazing story that tells the truth.,1
5223,It was very interesting! Kind of slow but very informative. Loves that it was about my home state of West Virginia!!,1
5224,"Interresting!
Heartbreaking how many years it took!",1
5225,"This movie really touched me.  It is a beautifully filmed bittersweet drama that shows the effects of patriarchal sexism on two sisters in Brazil.  While most of the film takes place in the 1950s, it ends in the present day.  The characters became very real over the course of the movie.  It depicts the sisters' perseverance in their separate lives, despite the major obstacles they faced.  It feels like a modern version of 19th century epic novels, in which you feel for the characters as you get them to know over a long period of time.",1
5226,"Wow! Ridiculously overrated movie. The story line is absurd as the main premise is the two separated sisters live in the same town and never know it? The girl gets kicked out of her parent's house but has no friends or relatives in the city she grew up in, and it would not have gotten back to her sister she was there?! If the foundation is weak the rest of the story falls apart. This is just plain stupid meant to attack old values as the father figure as its symbol. Additionally, its obvious why Hollywood would like it, anything that promotes promiscuity and exposure of the male member are sure to make them excited. As far as entertainment value, it is long boring and sad. Not the way I want to spend my time. Do not waste your time.",0
5227,"الحياة الخفية.. تتعمد إيلام يوريديس وجيداه
كتبت/ ضحى الورداني

افتتحت سينما زاوية فعاليات أسبوع الفيلم البرازيلي بفيلم The Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão من إخراج البرازيلي ""كريم عنيوز"" وبطولة Julia Stockles و Carol Duarte وFlavia Gusmao و Antonio Fonseca، والفيلم مأخوذ عن رواية بنفس الأسم من تأليف Martha Batalha، وسبب إختياره لحفل الإفتتاح هو حصوله على جائزة أفضل فيلم في مسابقة ""نظرة ما"" بمهرجان كان السينمائي 2019 وأيضا منحه جائزة أفضل فيلم روائي عالمي في حفل توزيع جوائز الأوسكار 2019، فضلا عن شهرته العالمية رغم طول مدة الفيلم التي تصل إلى ساعتين و20 دقيقة من أحداث تفيض بالميلودراما البرازيلية المصحوبة بأسئلة لا يتم الإجابة عليها.

الحياة الخفية لمن؟
عند قراءة إسم الفيلم يبدأ المُشاهد في محاولة توقع أحداثه فالعنوان هو العتبة الأولى لقراءة أي عمل فني، ولهذا ينتظر أن مشاهدة الحياة الخفية أو السر الذي تخفيه الإبنة يوريديس جسماو في حياتها عن الآخرين إلى أن يجد المُشاهد نفسه متورطا أمام سرين لشقيقتين يمتلكان حصة متساوية من الحياة الخفية وهما ""يوريديس وشقيقتها جيداه"" وقد مهد المخرج عنيوز للحياة المأساوية التي سوف تلحق بالشقيقتين منذ المشهد الإفتتاحي الخاص بالفيلم والذي تم وضعه مخصوص لهذا الغرض، يبدأ عنيوز المشهد الإفتتاحي بوجود الشقيقتان معا في غابة مليئة بالأشجار بمنطقة ""ريو دي جانيرو"" وأثناء رحيلهما معا وقبل هطول الأمطار والعواصف تفقد الشقيقتان تواصلهما ويرتفع صراخهما بحثا عن بعضهما البعض داخل الغابة الكثيفة وفي ظل الأجواء العاصفة، ورغم عدم ظهور الغابة مرة آخرى خلال أحداث الفيلم إلا إنها عملت على كشف الصراع النفسي الذي سوف يتم مشاهدته.

تدور أحداث الفيلم في منتصف القرن الماضي حول العشرينية جيداه التي تسعى من أجل نيل حريتها الخاصة فتقوم بالهروب مع حبيبها إلى اليونان رافضة سلطة والدها عليها ويوريديس شقيقتها الصغرى عازفة بيانو محترفة تحلم بالسفر إلى إيطاليا من أجل تعلم البيانو وفي أحد الليالي تعثر يوريديس على جواب تودعها شقيقتها به مصحوب بفردة واحدة قرط الأذن الخاص بجدتهما، وخلال الفيلم تعود جيداه مرة آخرى إلى المنزل ولكن يطردها الأب ويخبرها كذبا بسفر شقيقتها إلى إيطاليا وبسبب هذه الكذبة تحرم الشقيقتان من المقابلة مع أمل اللقاء مرة آخرى.

عندما يمتلك الإنسان سرا تتملكه الهواجس من أن يفضح يوما ما فيبدأ العيش داخل حياة خفية مليئة بالرعب ولكنها مع الأسف داخلية فلا يقدر من هو خارجها أن يتذوق ألمها، الس الأول كان خروج جيداه لمقابلة رفيقها والسر الثاني كان أكذوبة والدهم على جيداه بأن يوريديس في إيطاليا لتحقيق حلمها، والسر الثالث كان إخفاء والدهم رسائل جيداه إلى يوريديس، أما السر الآخير فكان تغيير إسم جيداه بأسم رفيقة سكنها كما طلبت منها رفقتها قبل موتها حتى ترث المنزل، العديد من الأسرار والخفايا لم تساهم إلا في زيادة البعد وتقيح ألم الفراق ومعاناة يوريديس وجيداه دون وجه حق.

الصرخة المستمرة للنساء
كشف عنيوز من خلال أحداث الفيلم الصورة التي كانت تعامل بها النساء في خمسينات القرن الماضي فقد جعل الفيلم عبارة عن عالم من الإضطهاد والسلطة الأبوية خاصة فيما يخص علاقتهم بجسد المرأة وظهر بوضوح في زوج يوريديس الذي ظلت مشاهده تتكرر حول إغتنامه الفرصة من أجل معاشرتها مما تسبب في إستنكار المُشاهد منه، أما جيداه فقد تم خداعها من قبل حبيبها وتركه لها عند علمه بحملها، وخلال أحداث الفيلم يساومها بائع المسكن على إقامة علاقة جسدية معها في مقابل حصولها عليه من أجل تخفيف الألم عن رفيقة سكنها.

 رغم كون يوريديس وجيداه الشخصيتان الرئيسيتان في الفيلم إلا أننا نجد باقي الشخصيات النسائية فيه قد تم تهميشهن وتعنيفهن من قبل المجتمع، فنجد أن شخصية الأم لم تكن شخصية رئيسية ليس فقط في أحدا الفيلم ولكن أيضا في حياة الشقيقتين فقد كانت خيال مآته أقرب إلى ظل الأب فهي ترضخ لأفعاله ولهذا كان غياب مشهد وفاتها وذكر الأمر في صورة حوارية على لسان الأسرة أمر بالغ الذكاء من المخرج عنيوز حيث أن وجودها وعدمه متساويان على عكس شخصية الأب الذي تسبب في إستمرارية معاناة الشقيقتين وأخذت شخصية نصيب كبير من الظهور على الشاشة.

في ظل هذا المجتمع كان على يوريديس أن تحارب من أجل الإبقاء على طموحها بالعزف والسفر على قيد الحياة فكانت تحارب والدها ووالدتها الذين تسببوا في سرعة زواجها ثم صراعها مع زوجها بتأخير الإنجاب إلى أن تصبح مطالبة بتربية إبنة فقد كانت حياة يوريديس بأكملها منذ إنفصالها عن شقيقتها ليست سوى معاناة، مثل هذا الحظ اللعين لم يصيبها فقط فلقد عانت جيداه منذ الإنفصال أيضا بأن تحتم عليها أن تجمع بين كونها أم وحيدة تحتاج إلى المساعدة وبين عملها كعاملة في وظيفة يدوية يقوم بها الرجال فقط فكانت المرأة الوحيدة في هذا العمل.
لا يمكن القول بأن الرجال كانوا مصدر الإزعاج والألم دون سبب، فقد كانوا هم أيضا مثيرين للشفقة وقد أخرجهم لنا عنيوز في أكثر من موضع ضعف سواء الأب أو الزوج وحتى حبيب جيداه الذي تخلى عنها فجميعهم ضحايا عادات وتقاليد المجتمع الذي لم يستطيعوا الفرار منه وكان عليهم التمسك بها حتى وإن كانت على حساب أغلى ما يملكون.

تعمد المخرج فصل الممثلة Julia Stockles والممثلة Carol Duarte عن بعضهما البعض عدة أشهر من أجل الشعور بألم الإنفصال ومعاناة الإشتياق والتلهف، ورغم أن  الإعتماد على هذا النوع من الأداء التمثيلي يتسبب في الإرهاق النفسي والبدني على الممثلين إلا إنه قد حاز ثماره بالحصول على آداء تمثيلي رقيق وساحر من بطلتيه، بل وقد عمل بطء السرد في نصوعهما وإشراقهما.

السرد الجمالي
تمتاز الميلودراما بتعمد إبطاء الأحداث من أجل التماهي الكلي ومعايشة المُشاهد لأحداث الفيلم ولهذا فإن أقل مشهد يمكن أن يسبب مجرد بسمة يصل المُشاهد إلى اللذة والنشوة بسبب تلهفه الشديد لهذا الشعاع الخافت داخل العتمة الداكنة، وهي الحالة التي وصل إليها المُشاهد عند رؤيته إبتسامة ""يوريديس"" للمرة الآولى والوحيدة منذ إنفصالها المؤلم عن شقيقتها، أثناء إخراج هذا المشهد تعمد عنيوز اللجوء إلى التصوير السينمائي المشبع بالألوان ونبضات النغمات الموسيقيقة عن طريق البيانو مثل شوبان وليزت وبيتهوفن في صورة ساحرة معبرة عن الألم العاطفي الناتج عن إنفصال الشقيقتين ثم الحنين إلى الماضي إلى أن تنتهي المقطوعة بتخيلها إنها تمرح مع شقيقتها بلا أي قيود.

مثل هذه العلاقات المضطربة تؤكد صعوبة خلق كل من الشقيقتين لأسرتها الخاصة، فنجد أن أغلب أحداث الفيلم تدور حول محاولتهما المستميتة في التواصل واللقاء إما عن طريق جوابات جيداه التي لم تحصل عليها شقيقتها وإما عن طريق المرشد المأجور الذي وظفته يوريديس من أجل العثور على شقيقتها، وبسبب ذلك لم يشبعنا المخرج بالكشف عن التفاصيل التي تخص علاقة كل منهما بطفله رغم إهتمامه الدائم بأقل التفاصيل التي تخص الشقيقتان في إطار زمني طويل، أحد أهم التفاصيل التي أثارها المخرج هو قرط الأذن فقد ظلت كل من الشقيقتين ترتدي فردة واحدة من القرط على أمل اللقاء من جديد ولكن السينما البرازيلية تمتاز بالميلودراما الحقيقية على عكس سينما هوليد ولهذا لم تلتقي الشقيقتان طوال الفيلم منذ لحظة الإنفصال بل حتى إن اللقاء الوحيد يكون صدفة بمقابلة يوريديس لحفيدة شقيقتها جيداه.


نهاية محبطة دراميا وفنيا بسبب كسر المخرج عنيوز أحد أهم مميزات هذا الفيلم وهو السرد البطيء للأحداث فقد تعمد إلغاء الإنتقال المنطقي للزمان الدرامي ولجأ إلى الإنتقال المفاجئ بالقفز في الزمن في نهاية الفيلم بظهور يوريديس كسيدة مسنة دون أي تبرير منطقي هو أمر محبط دراميا، وقد تسببت هذه النقلة في كسر حالة الميلودراما التي أغرق عنيوز المُشاهد بها ورغم إضافته لمسحة إنسانية في نهاية المشهد، إلا أن مثل هذه النهايات تتسبب في قتل مشاعر المُشاهد لأنها تحده من البوح بالحزن والألم الذي شعر به طوال مشاهدته للفيلم وفجأة يصبح مرغما على الإبتسام فتثقل إبتسامته أثناء توحيد فردتي القرط ليصبحا زوج متصل من جديد، ورغم هذه النهاية إلا إنه من المؤكد أن هذا الفيلم هو أحد أهم أفلام السينما البرازيلية لهذا العام وينصح بمشاهدته بشدة.",1
5228,"A touching story that lets you really feel close to the characters. A story of selfishness and non-empathetic people who make others invisible. But still you can feel the love of Euridice and Guida, surviving all this hatred. Must see.",1
5229,"The 2 leads are great. It is slow in spots, but overall it's powerful, with a good ending.",1
5230,"Well this one turned me into a pile of goo.  It's a somber Brazilian film that flies and leaves you bittersweet.  Perhaps not the most glowing of recommendations, but this flick works.  This may be a click pic, but guys do yourself a favor and find this on DVD and play it for your significant other!  You're gonna get big-time points for anyone who had a sister they were close to.  I didn't have a sis, but I still enjoyed this immensely and anyone who enjoys good cinema should.  Only regret was not getting to watch this with wife! I'm sure she'll see it soon!  Final Score  8.8/10",1
5231,"""Invisible Life"" reminded me the best Almodovar, the first Almodovar, the one that wanted to tell you beautiful stories. And ""Invisible Life"" is a beautiful story indeed. A story that reels you in slowly and steadily. ""Invisible Life"" is based on a novel, but the characters are honest and sincere, and the emotions they bring, too.",1
5232,"This movie is very good. One of the best Brazilian movies I've ever seen. The story feels real, shows what it was back then for women. I just loved it. I did not live in that era but fully understand that was very possible to happen due to the way women were treated and how easy it was to become invisible.",1
5233,"The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao is very well shot, well-acted and often undeniably moving. Many of its scenes are certainly quite powerful and the storyline is overall very strong. However, the film's treatment of its central theme is pretty unsubtle, and the obviously repetitive nature to it along with an overlong runtime robbed it of its momentum unfortunately.",1
5234,"Como faço para ver esse filme por aqui, baixar",1
5235,"Horrible film, not even worth watching on Netflix.",0
5236,"Far TOO SLOW, and so apparently POINTLESS, even as it SEEMED to be trying to say something worthwhile. Most certainly a wasted opportunity all around: Do NOT waste any more time on this.",0
5237,"This seemed like a pretty ""real"" depiction of people who have been marginalized, and many of them are suffering from serious alcohol use disorders. There's some harshness to it, but it comes across as being pretty honest.",1
5238,"Slow-burn wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't repetitive - this slice of life representation of depressing squalor is portrayed in very few shades. Smoking, drinking and monotonous sermons are atmospheric and naturalistic, which would be a welcome addition to a solid story. However, it is an achievement for a 17 year old and hopefully the young director will build upon all the laurels instead of falling asleep on them.",0
5239,"Yes, I know the director is only 17, but this has to be one of the worst films I ever saw.  
If it was a senior high school project I would have been more gentle in my review.  But this film is now on the world stage.  I saw its premiere at Tribecca and thought I was alone in hating it until I polled people around me.  We all found the movie depressing, the editing a mystery and the end a complete enigma.  This young man has promise, but he is far from where he should be putting his films in theaters yet.  About the only saving grace was good acting and that wasn't easy in this failed film.",0
5240,"Burning Cane is a small and delicate film that offers up food for thought and beautiful images, but is also a mess narratively and strangely disappointing. Made by 19yo Phillip Yeomans I feel this film could have been better with more development and structure. Set in rural Louisiana, it is about a woman named Helen who struggles to understand how best to love and help her alcoholic son and the alcoholic pastor of her church. The pastor is played superbly by Wendell Pierce and is the highlight of this film. The film does make important commentary on toxic masculinity and the overbearing power of the chutrch. But I feel the film tries to hard to be impressive rather than making a film with a cogent story. A film of promise but lacking true effectiveness.",0
5241,"Husband and Wife date night in the lovely indoors during a pandemic featured 'Burning Cane' which was't able to live up to the critic hype.  17-year old first-time filmmaker Phillip Youmans may have a career in cinematography, but it's most certainly not in writing.  Another in the growing line of feature films that could have told the story in 30 minutes.  The story should have been compelling, but instead it's expanded to excruciating levels with so little text on the page it makes you wonder if this may have been more effective as a silent film.  There's no there there. It's beautiful and it's clear Youmans will have a career in the industry if he wants it.  It's hard to imagine how a teen could get his movie financed, however it got done and it may be something to measure up with future work.  Unfortunately, this isn't a captivating or engaging film.  It's novel that a high school aged kid does a movie, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't treat this picture on its merits!  Hubby: 3.8/Wife: 4.6 Average Final Score: 4.2/10",0
5242,"This film has an interesting visual style, which is impressive considering the filmmaker was only 17 years old when he shot, directed and edited the film. The only recognizable actor in the piece is veteran character actor Wendell Pierce, who also co-produced it. The story is somewhat unpleasant to watch, but it is rather short by feature standards. Definitely shows promise.",0
5243,"The kind of quiet little indie film that has the power to stay with you long after you've seen it. Wendell Pierce is excellent as usual, but Karen Kaia Livers strong-willed performance is the glue that holds the film together.",1
5244,"This was great! It was extremely well-written with very interesting moral tones. The rural life portrayed in the film feels very real and the cinematography was very good. The performances were all incredible, especially Wendell Pierce and Karen Kaia Livers. My only real problem with the film is its fluctuating audio problems, but other than that, this is a must-see for indie and film fans alike.",1
5245,"I found this interesting in terms of the story, what happened to the company and the legal case etc. that followed, which I hadn't previously been aware of. However, I found the acted parts with Alec Baldwin portraying John DeLorean rather distracting and I didn't think it fully worked. I'd rather they use genuine library/archive footage and talking heads to discuss what happened - which, by the way, they do but the mix of that and acted scenes, reconstructions, jarred with me. I found it a bit hard to follow some of the aspects, the finer details of what happened and I wouldn't say its an especially engrossing or gripping watch but if your interested in the story, you do learn some things and also I did enjoy hearing from John's children. That aspect was insightful, how his kids reacted to what happened and their memories of things.

This is a somewhat interesting documentary, which seems to be not 100% sure if it wants to be the TV documentary show it mainly is, or if it wants to somehow also be a more glitzy Hollwood drama film, which it isn't really. It doesn't really work entirely but its still ok, hence my rating. I wouldn't go out of your way to watch it though, unless your particularly keen on the subject as such. I'm still a bit unclear about quite how he was framed, frankly.",0
5246,"Gosto de documentários com protagonistas ambíguos e polêmicos, aqui a dúvida é visionário ou vigarista... Basicamente John comete dois grandes erros, ao fazer duas grandes escolhas de forma completamente equivocadas, aumentar a produção de veículos defeituosos e a principal, negociar com narcotraficantes, ainda que tenha sido vítima, ao cair como isca do informante e do FBI... Como o filho bem disse depois ""para mim, é uma faca de dois gumes o tempo todo, à prova de que tinha sido armado estavam lá, mas o senso comum e a realidade me dizem que ele não era o idiota, que ele devia ter suspeitado que ia dar m****""",1
5247,"An interesting story presented in a unique way that probably ventured to far into self reference for me. Interviewing an actor, while they are dressed for the role, about the character he is playing in the recreated scenes for a documentary where the historical footage not only exists but is being presented alongside the reenactments, is something I had never seen until now.",0
5248,"Once again, The pompous Alec Baldwin has to make the story about himself.   He couldn't be satisfied just playing the part of John Delorian.  He had to make the story about Alec playing John Delorian.  It's a shame because the real Delorian story is very interesting.  This film actually includes the badly filmed footage of Alec putting on makeup and talking on a cell phone.   It's laughable (not in a good way).",0
5249,Alex Baldwin could never suppress his ego long enough to get into the role.  An interest story but Baldwin was 40 pounds too heavy and too much weight was given to his opinion about the subject matter.  With a different actor it might have been more watchable.,0
5250,"I love documentaries and was hoping this would be an excellent one. It was not. The writers completely eliminate any background on Delorean, such as when and where he was born, how he was raised, etc. The musings of the actors (particularly Baldwin) detracted from the story and were too subjective to take seriously. I considered giving this 3 stars if only for the good parts that were real newsreel footage. However, the reliance of recreations was extensive, and it lost a solid star because of the vulgarity of the son who used the f word in virtually every sentence. His utter classlessness detracted form the documentary. Then the writers used the same vulgarity in th end credits. Very disappointing.",0
5251,"It's hard to believe that it took this long to make this . What was interesting is the life of John DeLorean , what was a lot less interesting was anything Alec Baldwin had to say.",0
5252,"Hearing the name DeLorean, most only know about the car and the drugs.  This documentary fleshes out the entire story, and what a fascinating tale it is.  However, I could have done without the Baldwin performances, although he is clearly as arrogant as Delorean and thus perfectly cast.  With that nonsense cut out, it would have shortened the fil to a manageable amount.",1
5253,"If I wanted to watch a docu about Alec Baldwin's acting process, well I wouldn't want to watch that so there's no ""then"" but you catch the drift. Why do we need to know how he finds his inspiration as an actor in a documentary about John DeLorean? Or really, about any of the documentary making process? I am pretty sure they make docu's about making docu's so we're kinda covered.  Way too much horn tooting from Alec, et. al. 
 Lee Pace did a superb job playing DeLorean in Driven, so watching poorly made up Alec try to match that was just sad. *sidenote: what has happened to the make up industry in Hollywood? The wigs alone are hideous in period pieces! Where have all the good artists gone? * 
Now, all of that nonsense aside the documentary itself was way too slow. Delorean was such a mysterious, fascinating guy, why take so long to tell the story? Keep the viewer hooked, not so bored they turn it off...which is what I ended up having to do. Oh well. $.02",0
5254,"This documentary was great. The entire crew did an excellent job of bringing John DeLorean's story to life. Alec Baldwin, Morena Baccarin, Josh Charles, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job as well to reenact particular moments of his life. This true story was very dramatic and shocking. John DeLorean was a clever man who had it all and then just made the biggest mistake of his life that ruined not only his career, but his life. If you haven't seen this documentary yet, check it out sometime. It's a must see.",1
5255,Two crazy guys stuck together on an island with a Lighthouse. All I can say is Robert Pattinson and William Defoe both got snubbed out of Oscar nominations.,1
5256,"This movie is Masterpiece that, In a fair world, would win virtually every applicable Oscar. Visually Stunning, amazing performances, and on point in virtually every way.",1
5257,One of the most gorgeously shot films in recent memory. Cannot more highly recommend for fans of cinema which is in itself a master class in scene composition. A second viewing was necessary in order to really evaluate the acting - which was superb.,1
5258,"The Lighthouse is an atmospherically brilliant puzzle of a film - with stunning black and white cinematography, haunting visuals, and a foreboding score. Taking many cues from The Shining, it's successful as a chilling (even terrifying) exercise in semi-horror (with enough humor to balance out the darkness), even if not all of its provocative symbols and events fall into place. You may leave the theater scratching your head, but you will be satisfied by what you saw. The film will stick with you after - as you try to unpack its strangeness.",1
5259,"You ever have a hard time forming even the most basic opinion of a film because you're stuck discerning what exactly it was trying to tell you? It was far more clear-cut a deduction with Robert Eggers' previous film The Witch, but The Lighthouse has left me pondering character motivations, supernatural themes, and even stuff as fundamental as the very timeline of the movie. In any case, Pattinson and Dafoe turn in some frightening performances, the imagery, well, does its job, and the story, at its barest, ingrains the notion of being nice to seagulls. Please, don't piss off the seagulls.",1
5260,Beautiful and wild. I laughed until I cried. Would buy this movie to have it always.,1
5261,It’s a crazy movie and you won’t get closure from it at all. It will stay with you for a long time. The cinematography is insane and it’s more effective n a big screen. If you really Willem Defoe then you have to see it,1
5262,What did I just watch? Bad doesn’t even begin to describe this film. William Defoe’s character came right off the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Kept waiting to experience Rotten Tomatoes 92%. Huge disappointment.,0
5263,"Great acting, super cool cinematography. Good movie to see in a theater.",1
5264,"No narrative to draw you in, no characters to get behind or even remotely sympathize with, no journey to go on.  Such a massive disappointment after the enthralling “The Witch”.",0
5265,"Léo, un jeune homme de vingt-deux ans se prostitue dans la rue où défilent les hommes pour un peu d'argent. Les hommes défilent, tandis que lui reste là -- en quête d'amour. Il ignore de quoi demain sera fait. A non-judgmental film with great acting by the main lead, Félix Maritaud. Despite some shocking wild scenes and explicit sex, it is a character for which basic instincts for survival are essential and the movie makes you care for the main character and wish he would stop suffering so much of hunger, homelessness and a sad lack of affection.",1
5266,"Sauvage is a polarizing movie due to its extremely graphic nature and a very ambiguous ending, but that final scene was thought-provoking in its implications and the film is one of the best ever to tackle the subject of prostitution. The acting is fantastic and the direction is excellent as the movie honestly depicts the surprisingly sweet, but mostly creepy and some downright dangerous facets of this dehumanizing profession.",1
5267,"French gay porn; that was a first for me. I had this movie for so long and I don't even know why. And the ratings are high for no reason, like; the 'amazing' acting or the 'unusual' plot?!",0
5268,"Great movie, one of the best French movies I have seen for ages. Very truthful and to the point. Gutsy film making. The main actor is outstanding. Recommended.",1
5269,"'Sauvage' is a queer cinema masterpiece, until a third act blunder nearly completely ruins the movie.  This feels real until a decision made by our central character goes against everything we learned.  This is a bit hardcore about one particular male prostitute who's looking for love in all the wrong places.  Is this worth seeing?  For sure!  Will you be frustrated by the ending?  Up to you!  Final Score: 6.4/10",0
5270,"Too fragmented, it spends a lot of time going nowhere. It could have been 22mins long.",0

5272,One of the best movies about The sex business and what harm it can cause I have ever seen.,1
5273,"I expected much more approach to the character, interesting moments but gradually loses strength. ",0

5277,Sublime journey back to the late 60’s in Laurel Canyon. Loved every breathtaking moment of Jakob Dylan’s dream....,1
5278,"Documents a special time, a unique coming together of artist.",1
5279,Good to learn about the history of this music right from the musicians mouths.,1
5280,"Finally, somebody takes the time to to memorialize the seminal efforts of the Byrds & other purveyors of the California Sound.",1
5281,"Seemed more like a promo vehicle for Jakob Dylan than an actual doc on the Canyon. Sorry, but his voice, singing and talking is Boring!. There were a lot of bands missing (the Doors, Love, etc.). I use to hang out there alot in 68-71 but started to go there in 65. I thought Brian Wilson lived in the Los Feliz area as my daughter went to school with Wendy & Carnie Wilson and remembers Brian's sandbox, etc at their house. No Joni Mitchell, very little Zappa and other artists..",0
5282,Loved the original music and musicians. Didn't like the fact that the Jakob Dylan seemed to make it all about his very bbn of the songs. Too much of him playing and not enough original footage.,1
5283,"Would have liked more footage of the original bands performing and less of Jakob Dylon's band. But overall, a really enjoyable film with great music.",1

5286,"Intresting if you're a fan of Bob Dylan. Brilliant music and fun storys. 
Much fun footage as well. Great documentary!",1
5287,"Its a very mediocre music documentary, maybe interesting for Dylan fans but there are really few things to make it remarkable. Seems like no one who was interview remembered the time very well and Scorsese had to use the footage to keep the boat afloat.",0
5288,"Finally watched Rolling Thunder on Netflix last night - loved it! Favorite moment for me was a conversation just between Dylan and Joan Baez -- among myriad other wonderful moments.But this is a strange documentary....I'd like to read or hear what Scorsese says about it. I know nothing about how it came to be what it is. There isn't that much contemporary or retroactive analysis...and a goodly portion of what's there is a goof (which I hadn't read/heard about ahead of time, but caught on quickly, being knowledgeable about Dylan, and about some of the people featured in the film. The music and the footage from 1976 is well worth it tho. Especially if into Dylan. I tried to watch Renaldo and Clara twice in my lifetime and don't think ever got through it...it's really not watchable...but some of the footage from that is here. And handfuls of super cool footage--musical, audience, societal, interpersonal, and talking heads (like Sam Shepard, Allen Ginsberg).",1
5289,Meandering with great footage and music. ,0
5290,"Not long after I moved from Seattle, I got a special invitation to see this film at a small screening at Tacoma's Grand Cinema. I was baffled and called up a friend of mine who also knew and worked with Stefan Van Dorp, whose footage was integral to the movie's narrative. Apparently word had gotten back to Dylan's camp (and ergo to Van Dorp) about my positive review of his album ""Shadows in the Night"" for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which explained the invitation. I found the film quite revelatory about the nuances of Dylan's mythology, and was astonished at some of the heretofore unknown events of the Rolling Thunder Revue that were, quite honestly, unbelievable. I don't want to spoil any of it for you here, but I imagine I might have to address some of it in my liner notes to Dylan's upcoming boxed set, ""The Bootleg Series: One Night in Boise, 1972,"" an as-yet-unheard solo performance of songs that weren't good enough for inclusion on ""Self-Portrait.""",1
5291,"Enjoyed the music and insight into Dylan and this tour.  Don't agree with NY Times that's it's the best movie, so far, in 2019.",1

5293,Best film I have seen in 2019,1
5294,"Dob Dylan -- Most over-rated musician in modern history. Hasn't done anything of importance since the early 60s. Mumbles his way through this dull, boring and tedious 'musical carnival'. The drugs must have been REALLY good for anyone to believe this was art in any way.",0
5295,"Such a story of innocence, beauty and reality - all within a dream. The ending is profound ♥️",1
5296,"Poignantly presented and an amazingly candid portrait of a gifted artist coming to terms with his own mortality and taking stock of his failures as well as success. His music is timeless and I saw him in concert the night before the movie. See it even if you are too young to know the music. He has lessons to teach, cautions to heed.",1
5297,"This movie basically was a condensed version of his book, which I am glad did not get into the debauched life he really led.  One feels sorry for him, yet if you read the book you would understand more about why his friends won't talk to David, as he did really bas things.  It came down to the quote in the movie"" Are you a good guy or an asshole?""  Now David is sorry after decades he wasted up his veins.",0
5298,"It was a beautiful insight into the life of David Crosby, narrated by him, and so very honest and real.",1
5299,Really enjoyed understanding the life of David Crosby from his perspective.  He was very honest about his stupidity with drugs and wasting so much of his life. I understand now why Crosby stills Nash is not together.,1
5300,the candor and raw openness of David about his life and how he's fucked up and yet survived is remarkable. this movie truly takes you back to a time that got its claws in us.,1
5301,"We get it David Crosby was a drug addicted, egotistical, asshole. More music evolution, please. Could have been 30 minutes shorter.",0
5302,"It was nice to get to know David as a person, not just as a performer.",1
5303,"This was a total walk down memory lane, while learning so much about David and the people in his work and personal life.  Little did I know when I saw CSN at Woodstock !   I was pleased to find that David's voice is still great.  I've seen so many entertainers who lost their range and voice, but they continued to perform.  Walked away from those performances-sad.  I felt this was a heart felt apology from David.  I hope that Nash, Stills & Young can set aside their anger and reach out to David before it's too late.  Who doesn't have regrets ?!!",1
5304,Hi for the story. Really. And the music is phenomenal!,1
5305,"A decent sports movie and a brilliant comedy. The film has a great cast and Stephen Merchant's comedic writing is spot on. On the more dramatic side of things, I think Vince Vaughn delivers a very good performance, and Florence Pugh helms the movie nicely. Unfortunately, I think it's a little tonally imbalanced which keeps it from true greatness, it's still a very enjoyable time, however.",1
5306,I don't like this movie,0
5307,"This is a surprisingly nice natured film, although it undoubtedly felt cliched but that didn't stop me enjoying it none the less. The fact its based on a true story made it more interesting and I liked the determinism showed by Paige but moreso I though Vince Vaughn did particularly well as the WWE trainer, who has some good lines and, its fair to say, isn't afraid to put people in their place. Its a bit corny, in a 'person chases after their (sports related) dreams' way but its not bad either, as it has decent characterisation and features a good cast, which can make all the difference sometimes.

There is a nice atmosphere present during some of the bigger performance scenes. I wouldn't say its especially funny as such - probably the main plus point, other than the general characterisation, is the more fundamental theme of family dysfunction. I think probably quite a lot of people can relate to an aspect or two of this film, which helps add to its appeal. It wasn't a greatly memorable film but its relatively good all the same, so I suppose I'd recommend it overall, although the critic in me does feel like this film could have somehow been a bit more substantial but I can't deny that it must have been a quite atmospheric watch in the cinema at certain points.",1
5308,"y1a- Cast with more charm than one could ever expect from a wrestling film, the ensemble makes it a story that is heartfelt and impactful, even if the film does spend a fair amount of time glorifying the sport as a dream machine.",1

5310,"Great movie based on a true story.  Genuinely funny, heart-felt and lays the smack down!",1
5311,"I've never been a fan of wresting, say one exception and it wasn't the WWE.  But this is well written and well acted with only mild character and pacing issues.  But overall, I think it's pretty damn good.",1
5312,I hope to someday watch it on prime looks like fun with the rock,1
5313,"I mean, come on! The whole movie the performers train not to hurt each other (they have to ""fight"" ""5 times a week""), and the final fight is shown like ""totally real""!!! Like they punch and throw each other for real. Is it for mentally disabled? And it has 90+ ranking.",0
5314,"The excellent cast, along with an emotional and personal story, makes this a great watch even if you don't watch wrestling.",1

5337,Great movie that keeps you glued to the screen!,1
5338,"Uncut Gems is an anxiety inducing thrill-ride from start to finish. From the first moments of the film, clever tracking shots create an anxious and claustrophobic feel for a film that largely takes part in the sprawling streets of New York City. The Safdie brothers deliberately kept cameras close and minimized any panning shots to further emphasize the frenetic tone of the film. Sandler gave an excellent performance as the gambling debt riddled Howard Ratner (I'd argue its this or Punch Drunk Love for his best performance) and his nervous energy was compelling to watch. The score was, as expected, original and creative, really fitting the 'club' vibe of the film. Ratner's downward spiral is expertly crafted through Sandler's thoroughly convincing performance and excellent writing that consistently showed the cracks in his plans to strike it rich, despite his own opinion to the contrary. But where the film really gets good is the message at its core; gambling addiction is a battle that can never be won. Now, while most gambling addicts generally don't end up with a bullet to the head, even in victory, Ratner lost his life. After winning the biggest payout of his life, likely enough to cover his current debts and continue his obsessive gambling, he still lost everything. I appreciated the dark ending and similar to Good Time, having a morally deplorable character get their just desserts is a bittersweet ending that the Safdie brothers have made part of their calling card. The final frantic minutes of the film truly elevated Uncut Gems past Good Time because for once, the stakes were high and felt palpable. And the payoff was oh so sweet once Ratner got exactly what many felt he deserved. Overall, Uncut Gems is a step above Good Time and I'm thoroughly excited to see what the Safdie brothers have in store.",1
5339,"I wanted to see Adam Sandler in this role.  He was great.  The basic story was quite simple, but It was hard to follow who all the other characters were. The movie was disturbing.",0
5340,"It was a lil confusing with the goin back and forth, but I enjoyed it.",1
5341,"It was good to see that the ""Black"" Ethiopian (DNA confirmed) Jews were recognized and acknowledged on the big screen.  Misinformation has abounded in the history of American media on this issue.  I thought this to be pretty major and scored big points for me. It also addressed the issue of exploitation of African people for their resources. 

The build up toward the end with the unexpected conclusion also scored points for this storyline.  Good to see Sandler in a different type of role.",1
5342,Loved the pace. Loved the realistic ruthlessness of life. Loved the ending. Quality work.,1
5343,Very good movie. Ending put the icing on the cake for me. Well done.,1
5344,Seeing Adam Sandler in a dramatic role was exciting.  The movie itself was disturbing.,0
5345,"I didn't fully pay attention to this film, I feel, as I couldn't help but wonder what I missed. Something happens between two characters which is the pivotal moment in the film but yet I feel like I didn't see it. I thought this was a pretty hum drum, run of the mill type high school/coming of age film, which didn't really appeal to me frankly. It got good average rates on IMDB but it didn't really interest me. I suppose people of high school age may enjoy it more than I did. It did seem reasonably well made but it didn't work for me as such. I wouldn't recommend it, no.",0
5346,I enjoyed this comming of age movie and its quite gripping at times where you get a sense of emotion due to the storyline and quite sad story between friends when clearly he's quick to point the finger at his friend than admit himself that he's either gay or bisexual and the plot feels real and I bet many people can relate to aswell,1
5347,"Wow! What a movie! Beautiful, an emotional rollercoaster. So clever, subtle and nuanced. I loved every moment of it.",1
5348,"I really enjoyed this. Great acting, and overall production. Glad it didn’t feel like a lecture, like many movies on this spectrum do. Would definitely recommend. ",1

Giant Little Ones is a fresh approach to the Coming of Age Genre. The work of the Cast, I think most were Newcomers, was really good. The Screenplay and the Direction from Filmmaker Keith Behrman was good. The Cinematography from the DP was really fitting to what one would imagine summer is. The film is a different Coming of Age Story, one that isn't always funny but Shows big Drama at points.",1
5351,Exceptional movie that comes off as an honest and real depiction of high school  sexuality and the rollercoaster of emotions that come along for the ride.,1
5352,"Beside the beautiful pictures and the amazing soundtrack, ""Giant Little Ones has a bit more seriousness than ""Love, Simon"" but it still doesn't lack humor. I personally liked the open ending very much, since it forces the audience to reflect the whole subject. In general, the film rather challenges the viewer which I think is a very good thing.",1
5353,"Not really my type but I can also sit back and judge from a non biased stand point . Everything about this movie was undeniably above average 3.4. A coming of age and coming out movie, but it’s a little more complicated than that, there’s a bit of a twist ",1
5354,"This movie takes turns throughout the watch leaving you wondrous on how it'll fold. nevertheless this movie isn't much about its ending than it's about how it ends, and that's what it succeeded at, that process is difficult, slow and unknowable yet somehow worth it.",1
5355,"Technically fascinating - it was shot an iPhone, meaning we get to see events from perspectives rarely possible with more conventional techniques. It's well-acted also, a decent script - it's just a little dramatically inert, especially of you're sporting interests lie outside the NBA. It raises important issues around race in the context of professional sport and economics, but it needs more to grip us and make us care",0
5356,"Steven Soderbergh has an interesting take on the NBA draft system in this thought-provoking feature. 
However, entertainment value is not it's strongest point and I'm not sure I'd want to watch it again. 
With that said the editing style is pretty novel and does add an extra layer of interest to the film.",0
5357,"I'll admit my bias right up front - I love basketball.   So, to see a story loosely based on the 2011 NBA lockout was interesting.  To see a story with a ""behind the scenes"" look, actual interview snippets with NBA players, a gym in south Bronx teaching youngsters the game, all of it was enjoyable.  Do you have to be a basketball nut to enjoy this story?  I don't think so, but it helps.",1
5358,"Soderbergh's latest iphone romp is political talkfest with a real lack of shooting hoops.
I can not stress enough how little basketball is played in this film.  And I cannot stress enough how much talking there is.  It's more like a gangster or heist film with lots of powerful people endlessly talking at each other.  And in the end it is a heist.",0
5359,What a great and timely movie!  Bravo!  A pleasure with witty dialogue and great production values.,1
5360,Very entertaining for basketball fans and fans of sports business.,1
5361,"A thoughtful and compelling sports drama with an impressive cinematography, clever editing, a poignant and talented direction, and compelling performances.",1
5362,"As a Soderbergh movie, it falls flat, disappoints, and only makes me wanna stay away from his more rotten/ill received movies; While it may be good for passing time on your apple device while watching anime or a prestige show, but I'm with the audience on this one.",0
5363,"There seems to be a big disconnect between the critics and other reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes on this movie. I didn't find it appealing at all. I think the screenplay needed more work. I didn't know what was going on through a lot of it, and I'm well-versed in the NBA. I'm not sure what this was about: an agent trying to hang onto his clients, the culture of a lockout, a young basketball player trying to find his way? I don't know what the interviews with the actual players really added. I found myself bored most of the time.",0
5364,Did anything even happen? Snoozefest.,0
5365,"I loved this movie so much, watched 2-3; times and was not enough.
The first time I didn't understand the plot 100%, but the cinematography was amazing, the second time everything  became clear and loved it.
I liked the flashbacks/memories, the long shots along with dark colours, and in the second part the one-shot scene.
In the end it's all about love, you might look for an old love and not find it, so you choose the one that comes first.",1
5366,Once in a Lifetime kind of experience if you had watched it in a theater. One of the rare movies which was must watch in theaters. Film was partially 3D. First Half of the film is 2D sets up story where our protagonist searching someone reaches to a village where there's a singing competition and person he is looking for is going to participate in that competition. Lady tells him that competition is in the evening there's lots of time for that meanwhile he can go and watch a film. He goes to the theater and start watching film wearing 3D glasses which is cue for audience that next half is 3D and they should wear their 3D glasses and then follows uncut single shot breathtaking dreamlike sequence which hypnotize you. This was one of the most unique film I ever saw.,1
5367,"Bi Gan's mesmeric tale of a man, Luo, who returns to his depressing and downtrodden hometown shortly after the death of his Father, is split into two halves. The films' title only appears halfway through the tale, adding another layer of confusion to the already hallucinogenic proceedings. Luo's return to the place he left twenty years ago triggers memories of a distant summer romance after he finds a picture in the back of a clock taken from his Mother's restaurant. Their relationship is documented in flashback sequences, but the transition between past and present is seamless, and Gan manages to make the film flow consistently, albeit at a snails pace. Those who aren't fans of slow core style cinema (think the films of Apichatpong Weerasethakul) might struggle to find a foothold here, but for fans of pure cinema Long Day's Journey Into Night is an exhilarating and absorbing journey. The second half, one single unbroken take (originally in 3D on release) is mesmeric, and appears to be a dream sequence although this is certainly down to interpretation. Gan brings a Lynchian feel to proceedings, reminding me quite strongly of his 2006 piece de resistance Inland Empire. Long Day's Journey Into Night is nowhere near as confounding as Lynch's film, but it sucks you into its world, and if it works for you, it won't let you go until the credits roll.",1
5368,Please return back my 2 hours. Please.,0
5369,My lack of understanding of what was going on led to a disdain for the over two hours of mostly pain.  I was kinda into this until I wasn't and when i wasn't I REALLY wasn't.  I couldn't get into the second half of this and if you can more power to ya.  This has a hypnotic feel and not in a good way.  Final Score:  4.8/10,0
5370,"The first hour is a Kar-Wai Wong esque romance with such a slow pacing that would make Terrence Malick or Lars Von Trier feel like the Road Runner. But the second half turns into something completely diferent, an oniric experience in the vibes of a David Lynch movie but filmed in a ""single shot"". So when the second part starts you are actually so sleepy and weary that it actually helps you feel engaged in the oniric vibes it's trying to achieve. Remarkable! Themes of time, dreams and expectations are present trough the movie.


It is actually mesmerizing how difficult it is to try to find the cut in the second half, and the way they manage to avoid the equipments shadows to be present in the shot.

If you gotta copy, copy from the best.

The ending shot is a bullet to the heart ❤️",1

5373,The most beautifully dreamy cinematography you'll ever see.,1
5374,"Luo has returned to his hometown after the death of his father. The trip back evokes memories of a friendship with a man he calls Wildcat and Wan, a woman with whom he fell in love and then who disappeared from his life. The film is in two main parts. During the first half, he begins his search for Wan with only an old photograph he finds in his father's things. The film moves dreamily between past and present to develop the story of Wan. During the last hour, Luo ends up where Wan possibly is singing, falls asleep in a movie theater and we enter his extended dream. This is a fascinating, haunting, moody film that has all of the characteristics of a great David Lynch film. You can see the influences in the coloring and the way the director moves back and forth between past and present as though in a dream. The score and sound are excellent. The cinematography is brilliant – every shot is meaningful, and I loved the dream sequence that appeared to be a single take. The acting overall is exceptional. The director manages to make you feel like you do in an actual dream. Big thumbs up for a very creative film – if you like David Lynch films, you will probably really enjoy this one as well; it requires patient and very attentive viewing. This is a director whose films I want to see.",1
5375,A sad but beautiful movie!,1
5376,"Diane is a beautifully observed small film. A meticulous and authentic film that is very small in scale but large in truth. Set in a small town in Massachusetts the film follows Diane, a woman who is central to her community. She spends a lot of her time visiting her cancer ridden cousin in hospital and also her drug addcited son. She spends her other time caring and listening and visting friends. This superb film is small on action but big on conversationsa and human interactions. It shows quietly how rgret can transform a life and how family bonds can sometimes be broken. It can be sad at times, but there is some degree of hope. Mary Kay Place is superb in the lead role. She ads plenty of empathy to a rich and rewarding film.",1

Also, if you like the word ""Goddamn"" you are going to love this film.  I'm thinking that the Goddamn drinking game would be appropriate.  Very lazy script-writing.",0
5380,An intimate and earnestly acted film with some relatable dilemmas that fuel the searing titular character study.,0
5381,"Diane is an analysis of life and how we deal with grief and guilt. This film may not please everyone as it does take a darker path. However, Diane offers up a very engaging story and thanks to incredible performances from the entire cast, including Mary Kay Place, the film felt so raw and real, as if you were peeking through the curtains on someone's life. There was one pretty significant plot hole, however I didn't think it hindered the film too much.",1
5382,"The acting is first-rate, and it's great to see older female actors in abundance.  I just wish they'd been better served by the script, with elements that are confusing, implausible and unoriginal. In the end, I wondered if the writer understands women as much as he thinks he does.",0

5409,"I can completely see how this movie can be hit or miss for people, but I just really enjoyed this movie. I, like most people, loved Get Out, and Jordan Peel went for a much more ambitious approach to his 2nd directorial film. 

The story takes an already horrifying concept and it even scarier, while having an element of intrigue and weirdness. The actors are amazing here, especially Lupita Nyong'o who puts in an incredible performance. The child actors do very well too. 

Again, I completely understand why this movie is hit or miss with people, but this one just worked for me. My only major problem is there's a lot of out of place humor.",1

That being said I would not want to endure the intensity and grueling interrogation of our tribal tendencies of the second half of the film- again. But I say this in the best kind of way, in that it is exciting, terrifying and brutally effective. The strain of impending doom never seems to waver, giving a revitalized pit of bleakness to your gut every time another wave of conflict crashes into the Monos crew. The real ending of this film is when you exit the theater and re-enter civilization and can finally breathe a sigh of relief, because Monos doesn't want to let you have it.",1

5438,"Miles Davis:  Birth of Cool (2019), directed by Stanley Nelson, is a documentary about the life, career and times of one of America's greatest musicians - jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer, Miles Davis.  

Nelson has created a powerful visual memoir of Miles Davis' life and the importance of his music and composition to jazz and 20th century music.  He weaves archival footage spanning Davis' life, narration, first person interviews with former band members and colleagues, his family including his son Erin Davis, daughter Cheryl Davis and nephew Vince Wilburn, childhood friends, his former loves from Juliette Greco to Frances Taylor Davis to Marguerite Cantu, third persons interviews, and still photography to create a riveting documentary set to his music.   

The words of Miles Davis are voiced by American actor Carl Lumbly which are based on taped interviews that formed the basis of the Davis autobiography.
The film follows a linear narrative from his childhood in East St. Louis, Illinois to his final performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1991 to the retelling of his last moments.   One of the most powerful images in the film is seeing a still photograph of a bloody Miles Davis whose physical injuries were inflicted by New York Police Officers.   One of the most moving interviews was with French singer/actor Juliette Greco recounting her love affair with Miles Davis whom I sensed never stopped loving him.

Nelson has crafted an insightful documentary where his musical genius and the dark side of his personality meet fame in racist America set against the significant events of the last half of the 20th century.  The film awes, inspires and offers up a candid and uncensored look at one of America's greatest musicians and composers.

Nelson has succeeded in creating an intimate portrait of the man and his music and the importance of his music and composition not only to the development of jazz but to 20th century music.   Do see it for you won't be disappointed for it's an excellent documentary that is well-crafted, beautifully shot and edited, and tells the story of an American master.  Fans of his music will be enthralled as I was.",1
5439,"I appreciate biographical docs, like this one, that take a more balanced and honest look at their subjects as opposed to the more celebratory style, which tend to gloss over the negative aapects and shortcomings.",1

5460,"THE S WORD

It's time for the talk. You know, the, talk. 

Thanks to a tiny, pepper pot, ex-sniper and now media darling personality since 1980, North America can now converse sensically whilst employing previously taboo words like, wait for it: orgasm! 

Whew.

Now 91, Dr. Ruth continues her tireless campaign to make everyone comfortable with sex by talking about it with a stark openness that, because it is delivered by someone who looks like grandma, elicits everything from awe, to shock, to giggles, to inspiration. No secret there, that's just perfect film fodder, but what this well paced doc does offer is a combination of her astounding history, her unrelenting workaholic pace, and why they are connected.

As a jewish girl at the outbreak of World War Two, Karola Ruth Siegel was whisked off from her native Germany to a Swiss orphanage, never to see her parents again. Her remarkable journey from that bleak beginning to her celebrity status, is a riveting one. ""Ask Dr. Ruth"" follows, at a good pace, Dr. Ruth as she scampers from one event to another, pausing for some historic tidbits and reflection. Westheimer is all business though, even when discovering some long buried secrets, or visiting childhood friends. She is Dr. Ruth, the sparky, perky dynamo we see on television, and one of the most important voices for women who avoids the feminist tag. What's not to love?

Dr. Ruth will be at the upcoming October 21st screening at the venerable Mayfair Theatre. Maybe she'll answer some saucy questions.

5461,"Despite going by in a breeze, 'Ask Dr. Ruth' wasn't as effervescent as woman herself.  One pet peeve that took me out of the movie.  Ruth claims she grew up very poor, yet we have plenty of home videos of her.  As someone who grew up in the middle class in the 1980s, I can tell you that video cameras were not something most could afford then let alone in the 1950s and 60s.  To have that much footage and be ""poor"" didn't resonate.  So, considering how reluctant Ruth is to talk about certain topics, how much are we really getting to know our subject?  I take people to 'Gilbert"" about Gilbert Gottfried.  There you had an unvarnished look into a person.  This is a surface, albeit entertaining, perhaps a 'Dr. Ruth for Dummies' version of the documentary I'd like to see.  This is about the most the director, Ryan White, could have plucked out of the movie. Final Score: 6.6/10",1

5467,"In some ways perhaps Ceylan's greatest achievement so far, again dealing with human development, inter-generational relations and life in modern Turkey. Once again a superb production filmed in Canakkale (Troy) and in the countryside. The ending is profoundly moving as a son matures and comes to understand and support his father who has a gambling disorder. There are touches of humour and fantasy along the way. Key moments are indicated by the well chosen Bach Passacaglia (orchestrated presumably by Stokowski). As with the other Ceylan epics it is very slow so unless you prepare yourself for this you could be fidgety. But it is a work of (at least) minor genius. I am impatient to see what this director can do next. Like his other best films these stick in the mind and are not easily forgotten.",1

5470,"The Wild Pear Tree (Turkey, English Subtitles): Sinan has just graduated college and returns home to a small and more rural town, hoping to publish his first book that he refers as an ""auto-fiction meta novel"" (which in itself reflects the film's ability to get you to constantly try to unpack the narrative). His father is a schoolteacher who has gambled away the family home. He is close to retiring, and at the beginning of the film, he is trying to dig a well on a family plot that everyone says will never run. The film is partly a father-son relationship journey, but it is also the story of a young, post-college idealist who is at times obnoxious in his pomposity but is also trying to find a place for himself in the world. It is a period in time many of us coming out of college go through when we know without a doubt that we have all of the answers and that it takes life, living, and experience to recognize that we don't. The dialog is deep, and I think that I may have to see it again at some point to capture more of the depth of the conversations about religion, writing, and art. The acting is wonderful, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The Turkish landscapes are exquisite. There is a scene early in the film when Sinan runs into an old girlfriend who is getting married. The director captures such beauty in both people in those camera sequences. The film gets a big thumb's up from me. It is on the longish side (a bit over 3 hours), and it is in places ""heady"", but it is also a powerful and different kind of coming of age story. I loved it.",1
5471,"The Turkish film, 'The Wild Pear Tree', should be admired for what it is.  It's ambitious even for Nuri Bilge Ceylan to allow a film to kind of get away from the viewer, only to reel them back in.  It didn't work for me.  It took me out of film and there's a lot of movie here.  Well over three hours and there are stretches that are boring.  Not my cup of tea, but it's beautiful and an exquisite performance from Aydın Doğu Demirkol.   Final Score: 5.9/10",0
5472,"The Wild Pear Tree is a complex, multi layered film that is beautifully rendered and totally engrossing. The latest film from Turkish master Nuri Bilge Ceylan continues his tradition of long, complex films that shine a light in to the soul of humanity. Like his previous films this one is long, clocking in at over 3 hours. But it never feels too long, it is full of marvellous dialogue that shifts and changes. This film is the story of Sinan, a young man who returns from university to the small town of Can. He hopes to publish a book, named 'The Wild Pear Tree', before he has to potentially take on a mundane career, quite possibly teaching. He returns to living with his family, a mother weary of her marriage and a rather quixotic father who fritters his money away gambling. The fim is dotted with long conversations with various characters. Such as an esteemed writer and two scholarly imams. The conversations reflect on life in modern day Turkey, wich are also indicative of life aorund the world. It is a contemplative film that is rueful but realistic about humanity. Supremely intelligent and full of pathos.",1
5473,"This tongue-in-cheek and beautiful film is full of metaphors, wonderful imagery and deep, intriguing conversations. Yeaah another NBC film, I guess no words needed to explain how it was amazing in terms of photography, cinematography and so on. It is just another NBC work and how it has to be. But what I liked about this film was firstly successful explanation of existential problems of people from small village. Maybe its topic seems dull or monotonous, but the way that NBC expressed the problem is very strong. Secondly, films may be longer than standard films (3 hours). If you think there are lots of scenes that make film boring, I am sorry but you are mistaken. Because at the end I felt that every scene was necessary to get closer to Sinan's feelings. All of scenes as if helps us to understand, perceive Sinan`s feelings . There was one scene where Her Mother watched some turkish film alongside her daughter, in the scene from film, mother (I guess) slapped his son`s face. Maybe that episodes inspired mother to make ""why didn`t you get the money from him, I sent to you there bla blah"" conversation with her own son, Sinan. It is not secret that we all can be inspired by something and apply it somehow. Or just the topic and conversation with these religions guys maybe show Sinan`s concern or protest about his father. And I would love to say that final scene where there was one shot, Sinan used suicide method to finish his life, actually there were 2 times of suicide message. But it showed Sinan killed previous Sinan (?) and kill his feelings towards his father or even maybe give up on his poetry passions alongside the previous reasons.  Yeaaah you see how powerful this film is. Especially 3 moments touched me so hard. Firstly Sinan`s conversation with his mother when he gave his book to his mom with own signature, Secondly again her conversation with his mom after his father throw away his dog`s pic, and finally when Sinan`s found out newspaper`s article about his own Ahlat Agaci book in dad`s pocket. They made me very sad, they touched my heart and soul so hard. ohh my god",1

5478,"This one required another go 'round to grasp more fully what was happening with the dual characters of Commander/Jing, the shifting presences of Madam and Princess, and just much of the first half of the film. This part is largely setup and very slowly paced machinations and dialogue that will set the framework for the second half of the film. 
""Shadow"" is a film built largely on dualism, as the protagonist is two characters played by the same character; one deeply embroiled in the political and military maneuvering of the day, and one a meer commoner 'shadow' of the other. The structure is built around two roughly equal parts, with the first half a complex political drama and the second half a wuxia action movie.
I still struggle with the acting in the more period piece, wuxia/xinxia Asian movies. I find find the acting often contrived and over the top, and I believe if Western films had acting of this manner that critics would lay into them for it. Maybe this is too ethnocentric of me, but it's honest; it takes me out of the world of the movie to some degree. The laughing of the king (and Lu Yan), is supposed to show him as a spoiled, egocentric (even sociopathic, maybe) figure who is untouchable, but instead seems forced and fake. 
But more than anything else, even more than the fantastic action/fight sequences, this is a beautiful film to look at. It was shot in digital color but it's almost all hues of black, white, and gray, with the one glaring exception being human flesh and blood. The sets, costumes, weaponry and natural scenery are all varying shades (or shadows) of black and white, with even the riverbank apparently desaturated.
So give this one a second try if it was overly confusing, frustrating, or the first half poorly paced for you. I believe it will be a noticeably improved experience the second time around. 3.8 stars",1
5479,"This film is perhaps a little slow to get started but once the plot pace builds, its really something. It does well at giving an insight into the culture of the time (AD 220-280). The cinematography is quite impressive - with black, white and silver being the main colours visible throughout. There is certainly a strong grittiness to it, lots of bloody violence and some potential jump scares. Its very atmospheric and tense. I liked the scenes depicting characters playing stringed instruments - the sound of it highlighting a sense of fragility in an otherwise seemingly cold and brutal setting. The dialogue is quite good - its relatively thought provoking. There are some interesting gadgets used, a bit like those featured in James Bond films, although obviously this is no modern day Hollywood spy film. Overall I respect this film as a brutal and insightful, thought provoking watch that may stay with you for some time, so yes, I'd recommend it.",1
5480,"Wuxia film legend Zhang Yimou takes inspiration from the city of Seattle for Shadow - it's always raining, and everything's gray. 

With it's penchant for speeches, egomaniacal characters, and deadly political intrigues, Shadow is sort of like action Shakespeare. However, the director is clearly more adept at his action choreography than his screenplay design; the action setpieces and even the weaponry are inventive, well-shot, and compelling, but the story seems to end up too convoluted for its own good, concluding with a series of betrayals that seem largely unnecessary (much of the film's central device, regarding truth vs. presented narrative, could be served much more cleanly with a straightforward ending). Some of the plot even seems slightly recycled from Zhang's earlier project Hero, which also uses a period setting, royal intrigue, and a series of deceptive warriors as key components of its plot. 

Overall, a decent film. There seems to be a much more in-depth plot regarding Deng Chao's titular 'shadow', including commentaries on identity and inner turmoil that were only hinted at, but they were largely sacrificed for more choreography and smirking Machiavellian plotlines. Good choreography, but still. (3/5)",0

Its quite atmospheric and I suppose its somewhat stylish. There's a heavy emphasis on artificial light, with the bright red of the dress being clearly highlighted. Its certainly an arty type film and I wasn't surprised to notice Ben Wheatley's name attached to it - it is quite an English film with a dark side to it, certainly (bright colours aside!). I notice its categorised as a comedy film - it's not what I'd consider a particularly funny film, even dark comedy wise I wouldn't really class it as a comedy film, more drama, and horror or supernatural in tone I suppose. It has a hypnotic element to it as well.

It is essentially two different stories that meet at the film's halfway point, both of which develop their characters beautifully without being too heavy handed.

This film is very weird in not a, oh there is weird things going on way, but more of like an oh this film has no idea what it is doing kind of way. It seems to be caught up in the aesthetic and feel it is trying to create and keeps forgetting that it is suppose to be telling a story. Just a mess. I do not know if I can genuinely recommend this film to anyone, if you think the description of a mix between Halloween 3 and Suspiria sounds interesting you will probably enjoy this at some level and if you care more about the visuals and aesthetics of a film and less of the plot, themes, ideas, story being, purpose of the movie then you may also enjoy this.",0

5506,"The first part of this film was so engaging, I felt like I could connect at an emotional level with the characters, then out of nowhere they decide to reboot everything with some plain characters making the main character of the movie the... dress? Maybe the vendor? I don't know. I gotta give props to the director and writters for the originality but this movie feels like an overly ambitious project that fell waaaaay short. Needless to say, I don't recommend it.",0

It is risky for its setting, modern and recognizable compared to a bygone era and, unfortunately, still recognizable, which makes it go even further than its love story. It is led by a formidable and overwhelmingly handsome Franz Rogowski who, alongside an enigmatic Paula Beer, defies all expectations and takes the viewer into an emotional and political journey that, in the end, leaves a inexplicably sublime taste.",1

5512,"What I liked: the general mood of uneasiness where everyone is trying to leave Marseille but spending most of their time in long lines at the consulates; the surreal menagerie of characters, such as the dog-minder who kills herself; the understated adaptation of the story in vaguely contemporary times. What I didn’t like: everyone except the main character is barely developed, and despite attempting to be a poetic love story, seemingly profound relationships and life-changing sacrifices are absurdly established after one or two brief encounters between these half-characters. ",0
5513,"An illegal guy tries to get away from the city but that's not easy. He get some contacts to help him and they bond. The help is some times great, other times people around him makes it harder to leave. A pretty flat, film that sometimes glimmers. I never really care for the characters and that's a big downer. I also don't need the voiceover telling me what's going on. Otherwise there is cool music, in this OK story and it was a great ending.

5515,"Petzold generates a powerful aura of impending doom in this tragic tale of travellers desperately seeking escape from the present into an illusory future paradise. But, ultimately, love is the only impulse worth pursuing. As with his previous films, Petzold works his themes slowly but inexorably under the skin and into the heart, leaving you quietly stunned",1
5516,"Absolutely no point. There was nothing substantial. Not in a self-reflective way, but in a droning, pointless way. There is no subject or motivation. An absolute waste of time. I have enjoyed Petzold's previous works. However, the casting is not great. A few moments with potential, such as his relationship with Driss, but nothing worth your time. The concept of the film could be interesting, but it is poorly executed. Once more, critics rate it well to seem like they have a sophisticated understanding of the human experience. Nothing is gained but lost time.",0
5517,"Transit is a quietly powerful  and important film about place and the ways to a safe life. Based on a novel set in the Nazi occupation of France during World War Two, this film is set in modern times but the themes are the same and just as important. The central character is Georg, a political refugee from Germany who is about to flee Paris as the occupiers are taking names and jailing aliens. Before he flees he has to deliver two letters to a doctor. But the doctor has killed himself. When he arrives in Marseille he takes the opportunity to assume the doctor's identity and take transit to Mexico. But there are complications involving his widow and other characters that impact every decision Georg tries to make. This subtle film, in German and French, is multi layered and very intelligent. It's about the sanctity of life and how to survive. Some choices don't work, I think the narration is probably overplayed, but this is a very rewarding and graceful film.",1

Its quite grim really and frustrating because its clear that certain people are taking advantage of others - there is an element of manipulation. There were some mildly amusing moments, believe it or not, involving the kids, although I did feel sorry for them too, frankly - certainly the younger ones. I suppose its a somewhat thoughtful watch, not one that will suit or appeal to, everyone but I'd say this is an ok watch, which yes, I'd cautiously recommend.",0

Let me tell you this isn't respectful or generous or caring.  It's another in the increasing long line of movies that culture the audience to punch down at the less fortunate of the world who would never watch a film like this in the first place.  We're supposed to hate these people.  We're supposed to be repulsed while feeling a certain sentimentality for the kids.  When the movie isn't unflinchingly hideous, it's flat out boring.  The final act could cure insomnia, not to mention we haven't developed any care from the characters on the screen.  Disgusting.

5558,"An extremely important film with respect to representation for people with disabilities. Zack gets to be a full human with a wealth and depth of life experience just like any one of us without a disability. He is not reduced to a trope, nor is his disability ignored. In fact, this film has a very important question to ask of all caregivers, family members, and friends of people with disabilities: ""What if your care is doing more harm than good? What if your helping is actually hurting and stifling?"" The film does an excellent job wrestling with this question. 

Beyond that, the performances from the entire ensemble deserve major kudos (especially Zack Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf)!

For a first-time indie film, the team did an incredible job. I especially loved the score and cinematography. Everything was so grounded, so real. I felt I was in actual familiar places. 

My main qualms is that the film ends quite abruptly and I felt could have said more of what it was trying to say. Perhaps budgetary constraints? Regardless, I would definitely recommend this! A great under the radar flick from this year.",1

5603,"This is very much a film about despair - about living in dark, mundane circumstances and you could say there's an element of 'keeping calm and carrying on', or whatever the Chinese equivalent of that motto is. Of course, the irony of the current situation with coronavirus (this review dates from March 2020) came to mind but this is different. I suppose you could argue there's an element of fate about it or inevitability but then people may complain that it's too simplistic to say that. I'll let the viewer come to their own conclusion - in any case, its certainly a thoughtful film, with quite good use of camerawork, to pan around the various characters, show how downtrodden their existence is and it's easy enough to imagine how disheartening it must be for them to be in that place, mentally, physically and emotionally I suppose.

The vitriol some people show towards others did seem, on one hand, believable and also, for me it was obviously quite frustrating and saddening, for obvious reasons. It's in this sense that it is certainly a thought-provoking watch.

Speaking of camerawork, I did feel there was quite a distinct sort of floaty feel or atmosphere to this film, with the viewer apparently observing the characters from multiple angles, while also glancing around at the surrounding area. Its a thought-provoking, sad (also just to note there is one scene featuring a dog being attacked and we are briefly shown a somewhat bloodied dog afterwards, which could be quite upsetting for some) but a memorable film that's well worth a watch, as long as you know it's not going to be very cheery and perhaps it's not the ideal thing to watch at the moment but otherwise, I would recommend this film, yes.",1

The film's ending is  one of the prettiest I've seen.",1
5607,"Hypnotizing and delicate 'An Elephant Sitting Still' is an ambitious Chinese film written, directed and edited by Hu Bo. It's the first and last film of the novelist-turned-director who offed himself days after completing his work on the film.  This is a grim look at life and it doesn't have any pick-me-up qualities.  It's the worst form of humans on screen and that's a horrible point of view.  Add that it's nearly four hours, and one would expect this to be a slog, but it just wasn't.  I can't explain it other than to say I was entranced.  I'm not sure if i was rubbernecking, but the subtle performances mixed with the visuals and the music worked well enough for my taste.  This won't be for everyone, but don't be surprised if two hours fly by.  Of course, at that point the movie is just over halfway complete.  Final Score: 7.2/10",1
5608,"An Elephant Sitting Still is incredibly long for sure. Couple that with a very slow pace and excruciatingly dark, depressing tone, and it may be difficult to get through. But it does leave a strong impression as it explores loneliness, depression and especially darkness in humanity very potently. It's also well shot and it features powerful dialogue and emotion.",1
5609,"When it finally sets free, sets apart, sets loose, the sweet fragrant floods in, inside you, washing away your anxiety.

An Elephant Sitting Still

Bo Hu, the writer and director, whose first project, this project, is an almost four hour long achievement. Now, usually, it is advised to shoot something, some short film or a video before taking on a big project like this. And he has previously worked behind the camera. But even if he hadn't, this journey of making a film like such would have taught him well. Joking aside, the film never gets to that weak point. It doesn't have any. In fact there isn't a loose thread for you to follow up to that alpha material. You can't deconstruct the engineering of this film.

The film starts from an ambiguous lost point following an equally oblivious character in each scenario. Capturing a day of these fellows' lives, the film is difficult to watch for two reasons. Don't worry they are deliberately installed to speak more expressively. First, are the characters. Each character that we come across with, is always the by product of its miserable fate. As in, it is never in control of what is to happen to him or her. Either someone knows and is keeping its mouth shut than someone can't control it.

And if some can control it, it doesn't have the authority to and if someone has the authority to, then it itself is lost, misdirected and misinterpreted. Second, the cinematography. If we are following four lives in An Elephant Sitting Still, we are literally doing that. The camera doesn't leave them at any cost. The result is a close up shots of these various incidents captured through their expressions, performances. You feel congested. You aren't able to breathe. Horrible things go down and the emotion adds more trouble for the audience. Neither meltdowns nor reserved nature gives us a shoulder to hang on to.",1
5610,"This movie is different from anything i've ever seen before. This is a masterpiece.
I haven't seen a better usage of long takes + long silences like in this movie.
I haven't heard better soundtracks. They were all placed so perfectly.
I loved this movie so much, everything about it is perfect and pretty. The blueish tint and the cold atmosphere, the dialogue, the honesty and also insincerity. It was all amazing.

Easily my favorite movie of this year.",1

There's some narration telling the viewer about supposed bad luck relating to historical events and pop culture. I don't know how accurate it is but its kind of interesting. Not the most original of this sort of film, its not the best but not the worst, if you know what I mean. You may feel the ending to be a bit disappointing.",0

5615,"The overly comedic tone of this movie makes it less enjoyable than a true horror film and that's why I'm not giving a higher rate to it. As every good horror movie this one recognizes that less is more, that's the reason why the whole movie present to us just a couple different scenarios and only 3 characters. The multiple plot twists makes it intriguing, acting is top-knotch, but again the inappropriate comedic tone mess everything, including the ending.

5619,"From some of the same team that brought us ""Knuckleball"" comes a salty tale of betrayal, lies, deceit & murder, ""Harpoon"" (‘19). Written & directed by Rob Grant, this dark morality fable features long-time ""friends"" Rich (Chris Gray), Sasha (Emily Tyra) & Jonah (the excellent Munro Chambers) go on a day trip on Rich's Dad's yacht to celebrate his Birthday, but what sets out to be a pleasure trip takes a much darker & vicious fight for survival, as the truth behind their alleged loyalties & lack of trust comes to a head. This starts of in a jokey, if unsettling style of ""Dead Calm"" meets a sweary ""Dawson's Creek"", but this cruise is anything but plain sailing. To say too much more about the plot would ruin some of the very clever twists & turns of this great-looking, but disturbing thriller about how knowing someone for a long time can be more deadly than desirable. The trio of cast members play it brilliantly, especially Chambers, who really is an actor to keep your eye on in future & the script is believable, nasty, funny, snarky & it ramps up the violence, lies & revelations steadily in it's short 82 minute run-time, which is no mean feat, yet this film manages to pull it off with plenty of style & claustrophobic face-off's between the three leads, a decent amount of gore & some great lines. None of the characters are particularly likable people & it's hard to root for anyone here & maybe their fates are more of their own doing than they realise & they don't see this until it's gone way too far. A film about human nature, the price of betrayal & who you can really trust, which is much scarier than any beastie. It's a scary, but also darkly funny movie, made even better by bits of wonderful narration & naval superstitions provided by Brett Gelman, whose disembodied voice gives great little additions to the film & the plot without ever seeming intrusive. This fabulous Canadian chiller is a must for anyone who feels let down by their pals in the past & love a well-made, ironic morality tale, but without ever being preachy. If you're planning a trip with friends, just make sure that you have a think about if you've ever upset them first. In this fab, little movie, the truth just doesn't hurt - it kills. Bon Voyage. Grimly.",1
5620,"A well scripted, tight riff on Sartre's ""No Exit"". Engaging for a limited cast, presumably low budget Canadian indie. Manages to keep the tension despite long gaps between gore. The ending doesn't really make sense. It only occurred to me after the credits rolled.",1

5622,"I like Tessa Thompson and Lily James.  They put in good performances in this film.  The story was just okay, though.  It was rather depressing.",0
5623,"The performers are all doing excellent work and I do appreciate a film that occurs in North Dakota, yet the end results are rather drab and dull. It's hard to stick with it until the end simply because the film wants to feel genuine, yet has certain moments that don't quite match reality. The writing wants to discuss poverty, yet feels as though it was written by someone who never experienced it. All that could be forgiven if the narrative was more engaging, but it just doesn't quite stick the landing.",0

But different from films like First Cow and The Green Knight, the movie's slow pace bothered me a little bit, and it's quite predictable. It was the first movie written and directed by Nia DaCosta (who is already set to direct Candyman, Captain Marvel 2, and The Marvels), who did very good, and counted with great performances from Lily and Tessa Thompson. Nia knows how to create a tense atmosphere, and it's a good signal as she is now in charge of a horror movie.",1

5630,"In the pandemic of 2020, apocalypses have become the escapist/cautionary genre du jour, judging by Contagion's weeks-long run atop the most-watched streaming titles along with a host of other viral classics, zombie and non-zombie alike. The truth is that, for millions of Americans, America itself IS post-apocalyptic, the remnants of a civilization in decline after some unknown collapse at some yet-to-be-determined point in the not-too-distant past, borne out by the election of a man who promised to return America to this mythical era of past Greatness. These millions of Americans, like Ollie and her sister Deb, live precarious lives of quiet desperation, funambulating along a hair-thin line between survival and poverty. When one unforeseen circumstance could pull one under for good, sometimes survival depends on crossing that line.

Nowhere is this made more stark than in Little Woods, where uninsured workers are often forced to choose between crippling pain or crushing debt and it costs at least $8000 just to be pregnant (and the nearest family planning clinic is hundreds of miles away), in unblinking juxtaposition with the land of social democracy north of the border, where generic medications and reproductive rights flow like milk and honey. Canada as Canaan and North Dakota as the wilderness.

For most of the developed world, Little Woods is dystopian fiction. For millions of Americans, it's all too real.",1

5642,"By trying to not glorify the marihuana trade frenzy, the movie presents an exceptionally grey worldview of the culture it's trying to showcase. In those vast desert locations that start to feel more and more ominous as the movie goes on, It starts to be perceived as a limbo where the family is trapped in and the only thing that changes through the years is decoration. Combined with esoteric spiritualism, it creates a vivid setting. The movie looks gorgeous, to say the least, and has a great tribal soundtrack. The cast does an amazing job of presenting lucid and affecting characters that succumb to the allure and the greed. Some take up too much time, some just lumber along with the narrative like Zaida. 
What sort of puts me off is the implications that the backbone of the story eventually leaves. I do want to commend the movie for not pretending like the family was being put between choosing traditions or wealth from drugs. No, Ursula moonlights as a mob matriarch and still gets to have her little rituals and rites with no pushback, and so do the other bosses. It's not even Ursula's branch-specific feature. Apparently, the entire family can start waging a war on short notice. 
So in the end, the entire culture gets transformed by whatever the director chose to be the bane of these people: drug trade and unregulated capitalism, but Ursula's specifically gets punished because they've gotten too greedy by building a condo in the middle of the desert? Even if a third of her problems stem from her moron of a son that she literally didn't even try to do anything about? This entire set up makes tragedy feel hollow.",1
5643,"Birds of Passage (2018), co-directed by Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra, is a dramatic film about Colombia's drug trade, spanning a period of two decades from the 1960s to the 1980s, as seen through the eyes of a multi-generational indigenous family who become involved in the business of drug dealing.  The film is based on a story by Jacques Toulemande with screenplay by Maria Camila Arias.  The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer David Gallego.  
Gallego and Guerra weave together many visual elements to create a compelling dramatic film where marginalization, lawlessness, and poverty meet business opportunity.  The film is set against a wider context of Colombia's decades long conflict beginning in the 1960s between the Colombian government and several militant groups including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the drug cartels.
The film is in Wayuunaki, an indigenous language spoken by the indigenous group the Wayuu, along with Spanish, and a little English.   The film is sub-titled.
A recurring motif running through the film is the avian birds-of-paradise, a sacred bird for the Wayuu people.  This bird species is endangered due to the deforestation of their habitat like the Wayuu themselves who have been under threat and have seen a loss of territory and a traditional way of life.  These avian birds-of-paradise lend their name to the beautiful, colourful flowers which resemble the avian birds-of -paradise in flight.  The avian birds-of-paradise hold great spiritual significance for the Wayuu people as seen in their courtship dance called the YONNA when the female protagonist's daughter wraps herself from head to toe in a red blanket and chases a male suitor while mimicking exaggerated bird-like movements.  The birds-of-paradise appear throughout the film which serves as metaphor to an endangered people victimized by centuries of colonization and exploitation since the time of Columbus to a dangerous way of life that puts them further at risk and in harm's way.  Another recurring motif is the culture of the Wayuu people.  Wayuu culture, beliefs, and traditions are contextualized in the narrative of the film giving it richness and complexity and a documentary like quality.
The film is well-crafted making use of diverse angle shots, editing techniques incorporating long and short takes, night and day, scenic and diverse locations, and dream sequences.  The directors use interstitial titles to structure the film over a time span.   Close ups and medium angle shots are interspersed with wide angle shots.   The directors juxtapose the narrative of the family drug business against the simmering tensions amongst the characters and the community to create dramatic tension that moves the film.  It's a compelling and powerful film that shines a light on the drug trade in Colombia as seen through the point of view of an indigenous family trying to survive not only a failed state but to overcome poverty and marginalization.",1

5645,"I knew about this film beforehand that it was about Columbian drug rings and about Wayuu culture (although I didn't really know what Wayuu meant). I assumed it would just be more glorified violence and gratuitous drug use like many of these drug films, I was very pleased to see that it wasn't. Admittedly the plot was a little thin - a poor person with a lot of potential needs money and gets into drug trade, soon becomes hyper rich and along the way many people get hurt, eventually he regrets it all and everyone he loves gets taken away or killed, nothing new there. The characters were OK but the protagonist Rapayet basically disappears after two thirds of the film, the wise woman of the tribe (Ursula?) whom I actually quite respected earlier in the film for her insight and steady reason combined with mysticism became some crazy old bitch woman who can't loosen the apron strings and other characters who actually had some depth and honour become little more than one dimensional violent psychos later. Perhaps all this was intentional showing how greed and capitalism ruins individuals as well as cultures and societies or perhaps the film makers just ran out of ways to develop the characters further or perhaps they were just using the characters for the story and that ruined the flow a little. I was surprised how much the Wayuu culture added to the film, I actually found that very interesting and although no doubt a little over romanticised or overdone at times when I accepted the artistic license I believe there was some real depth and genuineness behind it. Of course a lot of the film was passing on the message of how greed and capitalism have, and continue to, ruin people, land and culture, how it infects societies and spreads, how it is very dangerous, how it has just invaded the land and taken it from the ancestors, nothing new there but I'm not going to complain about that because it is a very important message and one we still don't seem to have really learnt, not really, as things are just carrying on the same, if not worse. I thought some of the cinematography was very nice with some good shots of nature, whether that be vast featureless desert, scrubland or even lush forest. Some of it quite creative too, particularly what stood out was when they assaulted Ursuala's(?) house near the end - this house in very fashionable (and no doubt expensive) architecture and not at all traditional standing in stark contrast to the sunburnt desert around it and they all just arrive, blast the hell out of it and off they go, almost surreal. Also loved the end scene with the girl wandering off with the goats with beautiful sky and some desert and little patch of water, very poetic - sad and beautiful. I liked the interjection with the singing and poetry, putting it all into context, although these horrible horrible things do happen, including in real life, when it finally comes to it just a drop in the ocean of existence (doesn't make it acceptable of course). Then the opening scene with the dance, mesmerising and beautiful. So although a lot of this had been done before and things seemed to lose power towards the end the message is very important, the cultural elements were interesting and added much depth and it was nicely done.

I could have used some more (any) John Williams, but when you do a project like this you may not be able to sit down with all the people you want.

2. They hardly mentioned anything about Jack Foley--you know, the man they named foley sound effects after.

5670,"A predatory priest isolates and sexually abuses young boys who are put into his care — unfortunately, somehow, we've seen it 1,000 times before. In By the Grace of God, we're transported approximately 30 years into the future — depending on which character we are following — where a victim (Melvil Poupaud), now in his late-30s/early 40s, decides it's time to speak out after the harrowing realization that his abuser, Father Preynat (Bernard Verley) is not only still working with children, but has faced basically zero consequences for his crimes. It's 137-minute run-time is due to the fact that the plot does not just follow Alexandre (Poupaud) and his struggles receiving any accountability from the Church — personified through Cardinal Barbarin (Francois Marthouret) — but that it also opens up the stories behind two more victims: Francois (Denis Ménochet) and Emmanuel (Swann Arlaud). All three victims have taken various paths in life and have faced various effects of their abuse — Emmanuel is the only one who has a physical defect in the form of a crooked penis from the way Preynat would assault him, which he continued to do to himself through puberty, as he figured that was the proper technique for masturbation. The victims — and their larger network — are not monomaniacal in their approach either and have various perceptions of the Church. Alexandre, the catalyst, is very much the picture-book family man who still regularly attends Mass with his own young boys. Francois, on the other hand, is a rabid Atheist. The confrontation scenes between victim and abuser — one coming much earlier than I expected — are not shocking or tearjerkers. In fact, Emmanuel's scene with Preynat was abrupt, almost casual, as they sat only a few feet adjacent to each other in the presence of a detective. The most jarring moment comes early, when Preynat has the gall to state, ""I'm the victim here"". How Alexandre doesn't leap across the table and strangle the old man, I can't comprehend. Based on true events, the victims and larger advocacy network not only brought attention to the Church's cover-up, potentially saving future victims, but successfully made changes to the law itself, specifically, the hindering Statute of Limitations. This is a movie more about organizing, strategy, and highlighting the lingering impact of childhood abuse instead of a courtroom drama or network of cover-ups.",1

A tratti leggermente avaro di eventi significativi, il regista Ozon è abile a sviluppare la trama cambiando protagonista, riuscendo così a mescolare storie diverse e caratteri agli antipodi, dando modo inoltre di sviluppare personalità e reazioni diverse legate ai fatti accaduti.

The spectator gets some hints to be cautious to take sides, but in the end an avenger tone, however sober, is unavoidable. Very pleasant to watch, it never seems too long.",1
5679,"A well-made film about dignity in the face of hypocrisy

Written and directed by François Ozon and originally planned as a documentary, Grâce à Dieu (By the Grace of God) is a partly-fictionalised account of the case of Fr. Bernard Preynat. Probably Ozon's most formally conventional work, with none of his usual visual panache, the film was modelled after Tom McCarthy's exceptional Spotlight (2015), an important comparison insofar as it speaks to Ozon's lack of formal gymnastics; in short, the conventional style is matched to the thematic seriousness, which depicts the Church as an institution that talks a lot about forgiveness and redemption, but seems to have very little understanding of justice or punishment.

The film begins in 2014 as Alexandre Guérin (Melvil Poupaud) discovers that Fr. Bernard Preynat (Bernard Verley), the priest who he believed to have been defrocked for sexually abusing him, is not only still a priest, but is still working with children. He contacts the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin (François Marthouret), but the Church won't take the matter much further, citing the 20-year statute of limitations. Alexandre, who has raised his five children in the faith, feels compelled to act, and reluctantly takes his story to the press. He's soon contacted by François Debord (Denis Ménochet), another victim of Preynat. Now an atheist, the more militant François advises marshalling the power of social media. Soon, they're joined by a third man, Emmanuel Thomassin (a heart-breaking turn by Swann Arlaud), whose entire adult life has been negatively affected by his childhood.

Although the film's central trio are fictional composites, the sequence of events is based on real-life, whilst both Preynat and Barbarin are very real, with Preynat (who has now been defrocked, with a criminal trial pending) believed to have molested up to 85 boys over a thirty 30-year period, most between the ages of 9 and 12. Rather than telling the stories of Alexandre, François, and Emmanuel concurrently, Ozon structures the film in the style of a relay, giving the narrative over to each in turn. Of course, there is overlap, and towards the end, Alexandre re-emerges as the protagonist, but this style allows for a slightly different story-telling technique for each man. Alexandre's act is largely epistolary, the stylistic formality of which captures his formal relationship with the Church. Once the more bullish and theatrical François takes over, the style becomes more confrontational. Then, in the third section, which focuses on the emotionally fragile Emmanuel, the film is at its most empathetic, with a stronger sense of humanism. In a film noticeable for its director's formal restraint, it's a well-handled and subtle way of matching form to content without necessarily foregrounding it. This structure also lends itself to exploring the psychological specificity of each man in a way that wouldn't have been possible via concurrent editing.

This is important because Ozon is interested in the mechanics of healing, with each man dealing with their experiences in different ways. Although Alexandre found strength in his faith, he's constantly on the defensive about how his actions are not intended as an attack against the Church, arguing ""it's about justice, not revenge"" and ""I'm doing this for the church, not against it"", as he points out that ""families need to know the Church will always protect children"". However, whereas Alexandre reaffirms his faith, François rejects his, arguing, ""my faith is human, not Catholic hypocrisy"". For Emmanuel, the process of healing seems barely to have begun, if it ever will. However, the film is unequivocal in asserting that for all three men, the trauma will never leave them, it's a part of who they are, not necessarily the main part, but a part nonetheless, a part with which they will always wrestle.

From a more critical standpoint, Ozon overuses the epistolary format in the first act, which often feels less like a coherent narrative held together by letters and more like a series of letters occasionally interrupted by ""on-screen"" events. The film also occasionally finds it difficult to escape its origins as a documentary, with some scenes, notwithstanding the superb acting, feeling more like respectful reconstructions rather than scenes in a narrative drama. The fact that the case is still ongoing also robs it of a natural structure, and one wonders if perhaps Ozon wouldn't have been better waiting until the conclusion of the criminal trial.

Less procedural than the investigative journalism-basis of Spotlight, Grâce à Dieu is no less honest or unsettling. It may be too controlled for some, whilst the measured pacing and hefty subject matter will undoubtedly put off others. Nevertheless, uncharacteristically solemn for Ozon, it is another important document on a subject that, sadly, seems unlikely to go away any time soon.",1

5681,"'Love, Antosha' is an utterly charming documentary on a person lost much too soon, actor, musician, artist and all-around talent, Anton Yelchin.  It's a fascinating life story, which includes tons of pictures and video of the prodigy.  I wonder if we'll have this footage from cell phone pics in 40 years.  Pictures froms the 80s and 90s stayed in drawers, as did VHS tapes, but with the 21st century everything is digital and so quickly to be erased.  Anywho, it's really good it will made you smile, but perhaps it will also make you value every day.  I did want to know more about Yelchin's dark and dirty side which is brought up and glossed over.  It's easy to understand why it's not fleshed out.  These docs are a dime a dozen, but few delve into or have this much access to the subject's surroundings.

She later moved to America where she built her own movie studio in the then-prototypical Hollywood of Fort Lee, New Jersey, home to many nascent movie studios. After her marriage, her studio, and her filmmaking career ended she was then written out of film history by many film scholars. This movie tells the story of her life and her groundbreaking career in the early days of film, when she was recognized and well known as a successful filmmaker. The maker of this documentary tracks down her descendants and her papers and explores Alice Guy-Blaché's life through letters, film, pictures, interviews and through short clips of the over thousand short and feature films that she made.",1
5700,"I have been a movie critic in France and had cinema classes at University but I had never heard the name of Alice Guy Blaché before. I thought I knew everything, even wrote an article celebrating the 100 years of cinema highlighting Mélies and the Lumière brothers. Little did I know that women enormous contribution had been erased by movie historians (all men). Thank god, Alice is now re discovered thanks to the help of a new generation of archivist and documentarist. This woman was the very first movie director on both sides of the Atlantic. Her movies are incredibly naturally acted and fresh almost as if filmed yesterday. A rare talent now celebrated. A must see for anyone loving cinema and for every feminist out there.",1
5701,I highly recommend this. The background and history to Alice Guy-Blache's story is fascinating. I loved the way the research was animated and visual. So great that Alice's part in film history is now documented. A must see for many reasons.,1
5702,It is an amazing documentary i would highly recommend it 📽,1
5703,"If you love cinema, and the history of cinema, I urge you to watch 'Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché'.  Alice Guy-Blaché (July 1, 1873 – March 24, 1968) was the first female director, screenwriter, producer, and studio owner.  She wrote, directed, or produced more than 1,000 films. She worked successfully in France and USA.  She was one of the first directors to use narrative fiction, to experiment with colour, sync systems, and many other innovative techniques at the time. In 1912 she made a film with a cast of only African-American actors (A Fool and his Money). Despite the significant amount of scholarship and earlier documentaries on Guy-Blaché, her name still remains unfamiliar to many. Being able to see a documentary like 'Be Natural' in cinemas will hopefully fill this gap.  Let's write women back into history.",1
5704,"I hope everyone interested in Film, Women's Studies, and/or History in general, gets to see this! While it was disappointing to hear about the racially stereotypical nature of one of Ms. Guy-Blach's films, I do hope this opens to door to hearing more about her, Lois Weber, Oscar Micheaux, Noble Johnson, and other major voices in the creation of the motion picture industry.",1
5705,No idea where these stellar reviews are coming from.  Fascinating topic made SO BORING.  Terrible job.  I couldn't even finish it.  I'll do research on my own. My goodness.,0
5706,"The documentary is a combination detective story and biography of Alice Guy-Blache. One of the first women filmmakers, if not the first. She introduced many innovative narrative filmmaking techniques in the late 1800's and the film argues that she may have created the very first narrative film. 

The film is structured so that it tells the story of the research and detective work of the films director, Pamela B. Green, in tracking down the family, colleagues, and films of Guy-Blache. 

It shatters the early history of film, showcases dozens of scenes from Guy-Blache's films that have survived, and provides a detailed biography that includes her family history and filmmaking career. It also incorporates archival interviews with Guy-Blache herself.

The highlights for me were the documentation of the notable filmmakers that were influenced from her films and the opening animation sequence of the documentary. This sequence utilized vintage photos from the late 1800's to recreate the zeitgeist of the time, turning the images into a three-dimensional space that takes the viewer on an amazing ride that continues throughout the film.

5707,I love documentaries to begin with but Be Natural is now one of my all time favorites. I'm glad Alice is finally getting the recognition she deserves and I can only hope that more filmmakers do for other important but unheralded or forgotten people what Pamela Green did for Alice Guy-Blache.,1

5740,"I rented this with the idea it might be a story similar to Edward Abbey's novel, _The Monkeywrench Gang_. It was that, but there was more to it that made it a truly memorable film.

For one thing, all of the music heard in the film was filmed live on screen along with the action as it unfolds on the screen. I think this is a trend that was started in Denmark some years ago, but it is used especially effectively here. The musicians, a drummer, a tuba player and an accordion player/pianist along with three female singers, keenly observe the action and, on rare occasions, the actors react to the musicians, which creates an interesting surreal aspect to the film. 

The music has an Eastern European flavor. It reminded me of the famous Bulgarian choir whose name eludes me at the moment. I guess they are meant to represent the small role the Ukraine plays in the plot. (The child to be adopted is Ukrainian.)

This reminds me of a devised-theatre production of Jane Eyre I saw in London recently where the musicians occupy prominent spots on the stage and are intended to be seen and not just heard. And several other recent ""plays with music"" such as The Victorian in the Wall also take this approach to music, giving it a prominent role in the plot, almost as if it were another character.

On a related note, the Wikipedia page for the film mentions that an American remake is in the works and that Jodie Foster has been designated to direct it and act in it. I have mixed feelings about that. Why does everything have to be translated to an American context? Do we really need to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world in this way? And what's wrong with watching a film in a language you don't understand? People from small countries like Iceland do it all the time.

But it's not just foreign-language films that do this. Consider The Office, which apparently wasn't good enough as a British series but had to be translated to an American context, or The Wickerman, the masterpiece that was completely ruined at the hands of Hollywood.

Not to knock Hollywood. Hollywood does great films its own way. But why not stick to what we know best and let the rest of the world make their own unique contributions?",1

Doña Quijote contra los nuevos molinos

Extracto

Inclasificable, original película islandesa sobre una quijotesca activista ambiental y una decisión que cambiará su vida, con ecos del cine de Kusturica y que combina admirablemente el relato intimista con el cine de acción.
Reseña
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

Reseña:

Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir) es una directora de coro islandesa cercana a los 50 y al mismo tiempo una solitaria activista ambiental que lleva adelante una serie de atentados para desalentar inversiones chinas en la contaminante industria local del aluminio. Pero una novedad que puede alterar radicalmente su vida privada entra en escena.

La película de Benedikt Erlingsson suma al carisma de su protagonista, varios rasgos de originalidad en su puesta en escena (que recuerda al cine de Kusturica), un humor seco (por momentos absurdo) típicamente nórdico, los hermosos paisajes islandeses (no como postal sino como marco necesario), una clara crítica a las industrias contaminantes y agudas reflexiones sobre el manejo de la agenda política y una lograda y curiosa integración de relato intimista con película de acción.

Halla es una mujer comprometida con su causa, quijotesca, que pone en juego su comodidad burguesa (con una importante demanda física para la actriz protagónica), frente a una encrucijada cuya resolución es conmovedora, en un filme con un desarrollo difícilmente previsible.

Doña Quixote against the new mills

Abstract

Unclassifiable, original Icelandic film about an quixotic environmental activist and a decision that will change her life, with echoes of Kusturica cinema, admirably combining intimate storytelling with action cinema.



………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ………………………… ..



Review:

Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir) is an Icelandic choir director in her late fifties and at the same time a lonely environmental activist who carries out a series of attacks to discourage Chinese investment in the polluting local aluminum industry. But a novelty that can radically alter her private life enters the picture.

Benedikt Erlingsson's film adds to the charisma of its protagonist, various traits of originality in its staging (reminiscent of the Kusturica cinema), a dry humor (at times absurd) typically Nordic, the beautiful Icelandic landscapes (not as a postcard but as a necessary framework), a clear criticism of polluting industries and sharp reflections on the management of the political agenda and a successful and curious integration of an intimate story with an action film.

Halla is a woman committed to her cause, quixotic, who puts her bourgeois comfort at stake (with an important physical demand for the leading actress), faced with a crossroads whose resolution is moving, in a film with a development that is difficult to foresee.

5744,"Talk about white privilege! The woman is a domestic terrorist, but her family is still able to adopt a child. The musicians are creepy, very stalkerish. The best part of the movie is the Latino guy who keeps getting arrested while on vacation...that is the most believable part of the film.",0
5745,"Brilliant film - the storyline, the context (trying to protect the future for our children and our environment), actors, script, the sharp wit and dry humour, the music, the astute observations of our politicians and industry. 

I can't recommend this movie highly enough - one of the best I have seen and experienced. Long may women stay at war for the future generations.",1
5746,"Woman at War is a film about a woman who has taken on the role of eco-terrorist to try and fight increased industrialization in Iceland. The question is, can she fight for what she thinks is right, keep her identity hidden from the authorities, and live a normal life in the meantime? This movie was exhilarating in all the right ways. I was totally invested in her adventures, and always wondered if she would take things too far. When regular life comes into play, I was even more interested to see what she might do, since balancing life as an outlaw with domestic life could be impossible. I was totally intrigued by this character. She is likable, and feels like one of the most friendly women you could possibly meet, and yet she is also fiercely passionate about a cause and does what she can for the betterment of her country (without hurting anyone in the process.) One of the more quirky elements of Woman at War is something I’d rather not spoil for those who haven’t seen the film. However, it’s a fun way of breaking the fourth wall that I never saw coming. It made me laugh every time they went there, and added a unique element that sets this film apart from others I’ve seen. Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir is absolutely awesome in the lead role. She has to carry a great deal of this film on her own, and she manages to do it all and make it look easy. The tone of the film ranges from serious to silly, and that could throw some people off. Personally, I thought it worked remarkably well, and I enjoyed both the chuckles and the stress of our hero possibly being caught. It’s a movie that entertains you and makes a point all at the same time. I would highly recommend Woman at War to anyone looking for something off the beaten path. It’s a delightfully different kind of film.",1

To protect against the bombings, the doctors have built an underground cave tunnel system for the patients.

This is a powerful film that shows the result of a government attacking its own people. Every time the camera cuts to an exterior shot, and I see hollowed out buildings and rubble, I have to remind myself that it's not a post-apocalyptic fictional set, but rather real life.

5802,"If you consider yourself knowledgable about Syria and the civil war that has torn through the nation then you are certainly familiar with some of the documentaries that have come out with just harrowing footage.  'The Cave' is no exception.  It's a hard and vivid watch.  You wish it wasn't real.  You wonder why a great nation like the US would allow these things to go on.  Yet where do we go from here?  Syrian film director Feras Fayyad has cobbled together a fantastic companion piece to his Oscar nominated  'Last Men in Aleppo'.  What really strikes me is the treatment of women even during this crisis.  We have a husband of a patient who is upset that a woman runs the hospital and even when a woman does the cooking of food that likely isn't fresh the men STILL complain. Beggars apparently CAN be choosers.    The film profiles Amani Ballour, the aforementioned doc running the makeshift hospital.  Look up hero in the dictionary and there's a picture of her.  Final Score: 7.7/10",1
5803,"The Cave is an extremely important and vital documentary about the ongoing situation in war torn Syria. It's a very concise and extremely well made film about the area of Ghouta near Damascus that was a rebel stronghold against the Syrian regime. For many years it was bombed constantly by the regime with the support of Russian fighter planes. In this environment existed 'The Cave', an underground hospital to care for the countless wounded. The main doctor is Amani Ballour. Hers is a profile in courage. Not just her daily battle to save lives but also the battle in being a women in a charge in a patriarchal society. This film is often distressing to watch, but it is a great document of this unbearable suffering.",1
5804,Oscar nominated documentary highlights a female doctor during the Syrian civil war.  It is very hard to watch knowing there is no good ending to it.,1
5805,"This is the latest film by Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad, who made Last Men in Aleppo, the gripping film about the White Helmets, the men who risked their lives to rescue civilians from bombing-related rubble. This documentary follows Dr. Amani, a pediatrician and managing physician of the Cave, an underground hospital in a city near Damascus, as she struggles to keep her hospital running. Food, medicine, and medical supplies are dwindling (one of the surgeons plays classical music on his phone and asks his patients to relax during surgery because of the lack of anesthesia), and the increasing risk of chemical weapons forces them to conduct their surgeries below the ground. It is a powerful and inspiring story of a woman and her many female colleagues who fight against the Russian army as well as prejudice from their own patriarchal culture to ensure that as many people as possible, a large number who are children, can be healed. While the film is a bit difficult to follow sometimes, the images are striking; like For Sama, which has a similar subject matter, the visuals of the bombings and the scarred city are horrifying. There are many shots of children who have been damaged by bombings, chemical attacks, and loss of their parents.  Big thumbs up for an important film that shows us the work of true heroines saving lives against great odds and, also like For Sama, presents important questions about the choices we make.",1

A través de la historia de un abogado (a cargo de Darío Grandinetti) frente a un suceso inesperado, Benjamín Naishtat articula un potente policial político y un verdadero ensayo sociológico sobre las miserias de un pueblo de una provincia innominada de la Argentina en 1975 y su aparente normalidad en una etapa turbulenta de su historia. Y con una gran cinematografía.
Through the story of a lawyer (led by Darío Grandinetti) facing an unexpected event, Benjamín Naishtat articulates a powerful political policeman and a true sociological essay on the miseries of a town in an unnamed province of Argentina in 1975 and its apparent normality at a turbulent stage in its history. And with great cinematography.

....................................................................................................................................
Corre el año 1975. Claudio (Darío Grandinetti) es el Doctor, un abogado de prestigio de un pueblo en una provincia innominada de Argentina, casado con Susana (Andrea Frigerio) y con un hija adolescente. Un tenso incidente con un extraño (Diego Cremonesi) en un restaurante del pueblo será el primero de una serie de eventos que pondrán en cuestión la calma del Doctor.
En realidad, la primera escena de la película es otra, un potente plano fijo sobre una casa, en una escena de enorme elocuencia. Para quienes no lo saben, o no lo recuerdan, en 1975 gobernaba Isabel Perón y ya la Argentina estaba asolada por los secuestros y asesinatos de la Triple A (Alianza Anticomunista Argentina), una organización parapolicial vinculada al Gobierno, en un verdadero anticipo de lo que sería el terrorismo de estado instaurado por la dictadura cívico-militar que derrocó a Isabel en 1976.



Rojo es un film notable y perturbador. Su trama sufre una aparente deriva por situaciones que parecen inconexas pero que en realidad se integran en una poderosa e implacable radiografía de una época: la violencia (a veces dejada fuera de campo), las desapariciones, el despojo, el saqueo de las víctimas, la estafa, el silencio, la impostura, la impunidad. Pero todo bajo una capa de aparente normalidad y en el marco de una provincia intervenida para ""restaurarla"".

La película de Naishtat podría definirse como un policial negro sociológico y político. Cada escena es un apunte necesario (y jamás subrayado) sobre el cuadro general, incluida la lograda escena en una playa de Mar del Plata.

Desde lo formal, la recreación fílmica de la época es notable, con ese tono entre desteñido y sepia que domina la fotografía y sus títulos rojos. Hay un gran uso de los planos fijos y de hermosos planos generales en locaciones desérticas.

Muy buena actuación de Grandinetti, mientras que la aparente sobreactuación de un personaje que aparece luego a cargo de Alfredo Castro (el actor de Tengo miedo torero), también tiene su justificación.

No podía estar ausente el dispositivo escolar en esta historia, cuando una profesora (Susana Pampín) ensaya con la hija de Claudio y otros compañeros la danza Los Salvajes de la ópera Las Indias Galantes de Rameau (un lujo de la banda sonora) para un acto escolar y lo que dice para ponerlos en situación para la escena,  en lo que constituye una inquietante puesta en abismo.

......................................................................................................................................
It is 1975. Claudio (Darío Grandinetti) is the Doctor, a prestigious lawyer from a town in an unnamed province of Argentina, married to Susana (Andrea Frigerio) and with a teenage daughter. A tense incident with a stranger (Diego Cremonesi) in a town restaurant will be the first in a series of events that will call into question the Doctor's calm.

Actually, the first scene of the film is another, a powerful fixed shot over a house, in a scene of enormous eloquence. For those who do not know, or do not remember, in 1975 Isabel Perón ruled and Argentina was already devastated by the kidnappings and murders of the Triple A (Alianza Anticomunista Argentina), a parapolice organization linked to the Government, in a true advance of what that it would be state terrorism established by the civil-military dictatorship that overthrew Isabel in 1976.

Red is a remarkable and disturbing film. Its plot suffers an apparent drift by situations that seem disconnected but that in reality are integrated into a powerful and implacable X-ray of an era: violence (sometimes left out of the field), disappearances, dispossession, looting of the victims, the swindle, the silence, the imposture, the impunity. But all under a layer of apparent normality and within the framework of a province intervened to ""restore"" it.

Naishtat's film could be defined as a sociological and political black cop. Each scene is a necessary note (and never underlined) on the general picture, including the successful scene on a beach in Mar del Plata.

From the formal point of view, the filmic recreation of the time is remarkable, with that tone between faded and sepia that dominates photography and its red titles. There is a great use of still shots and beautiful wide shots in desert locations.

Grandinetti's very good performance, while the apparent over-acting of a character who later appears in charge of Alfredo Castro (the actor from I'm afraid of a bullfighter), also has its justification.

The school device could not be absent in this story, when a teacher (Susana Pampín) rehearses with Claudio's daughter and other classmates the dance Los Salvajes from the opera Las Indias Galantes by Rameau (a luxury of the soundtrack) for an act school and what he says to put them in position for the scene, in what constitutes a disturbing stagin",1
5810,"Rojo is a mixed bag - on the one hand, the film maintains a valid portrayal of a society (specifically, its middle class) that maintains the appearances of stability and reason even as it becomes more and more apparent that cracks are gradually developing in the facade, and a bubbling cauldron of unrest lies beneath. On the other hand, the subplots feel inconsistent (the adolescent romance in particular) and the tension doesn't feel oppressing even when intended, but perhaps the latter is in part due to the language barrier and the need to interpret dialogue through subtitles. Perhaps there is some clever social commentary or historical context that I'm missing to tie some of these pieces together. The film still has a clear overarching voice that deserves commendation, though. (3/5)",0

There are some completely absurd scenes, but the people in them don't seem to find them absurd at all, which, I think, is the point. It's the way that we human beings can gradually be led to accept the unthinkable as normal that makes the film so chilling as a parallel to current times. Fascinating, also, that the film-maker is too young to have experienced this time in Argentina. I rather liked the film, but I can see why it's not accessible to everyone.

Full of empty.  The best thing about this movie was the dog and he wanted to escape and for good reason.  There may have been a better movie down the road.  Make no mistake it's gorgeous and the child performances are endearing (two critics favs), but for the average cinephile, there's no there there.

5823,"aesthetically very pleasing, beautiful shots, round story, but you can't make an entire movie on nice shots. It's okay to leave a viewer with some questions, but I felt a bit too lost sometimes, maybe a lot of questions are unanswered because they're irrelevant, because those things could distract you from what it is you should really be focused on. For me the plot wasn't clear enough and that makes it hard to really get into a movie. Of course, you always need to break some rules while making a movie, but it's really important to know which ones to break. A movie doesn't always have to be introduction, inciting accident, journey, climax, resolution of course. Movies are not defined as good guy beats bad guy. But I think that in this movie a structure like that was missing in such a way that it makes it kind of hard to know what you should be feeling and maybe that is the point. However, it is a beautiful movie just as call me by your name and they've done an incredible job at establishing a mesmerizing ambience. ",1

5825,"- It's Too Late for these kids to Die Young -

Watching Too Late to Die Young (Tarde Para Morir Joven) felt like being carried by a gentle stream. Sure, there were some sharp edges and cold spots along the way that jostled me a bit, but it had a dreamlike, even-keeled quality I haven't found in many Hollywood movies.

This latest offering from Chilean writer/director Dominga Sotomayor (Thursday Till Sunday) is about a group of children growing up in a commune during the hot summer of 1990, inspired by her own similar upbringing. Up the mountain and quite a drive from the nearest city, a loosely organized group of families have created an intentional community where the children rove in packs, everybody knows everybody else's stories, and decisions are made together. 

Yet it's not the finer points of commune life, or Chile's changing socio-political climate which drive the story. Rather, we get to look through the eyes and ears of three young people reckoning with their adolescence in the midst of very peculiar and chaotic surroundings. I was honestly expecting more plot and politics (after all, Chile's military dictatorship had just ended!) but was pretty delighted that instead, I got to see a sweeter, more universal story that was so easy for me to relate to, even though I grew up in totally different circumstances! 

Ten-year-old Clara (Magdalena Tótoro) is a curious and observant child, who insists that she is only too little ""on the outside."" And teenagers Sofía (Demian Hernández) and Lucas (Antar Machado) are wrestling with first loves, the ache to drive on the open road, and figuring out their own bodies and friendships. The plot builds around fairly mundane moments, like Clara's dog going missing, or the big upcoming New Year's party. But even moments which seem insignificant to an outsider can have a monumental and lasting impact in the life of a child. I, too, remember plotting with my fellow tiny comrades on how to best keep ourselves awake 'til dawn during sleepovers. I too, remember the joyful, terrifying rush of the steering wheel beneath my fingers when I first barrelled onto the interstate at sixteen years old.

While not a thrilling suspense or a splashy blockbuster, this movie has a truly charming quietness and is noticeably created by people who know how to frame a good shot and catch the ideal light. The score and soundtrack are also perfect to set the tone; the viewer only hears music when actual music is being played in the film, either from a battery-powered cassette player or from live musicians. I loved the almost dreamlike direction and camera work, and how the scruff, pale landscape of the dry brush and rocks is framed bright and clear, rather than bleak, even without many flowers or green things. From the brittle brush to the hanging moss, everything looks so flammable - I was constantly anxious that it all might go up in smoke at any moment. It's a fitting reminder of the fragility of their commune, and of youth itself. Beautiful, but so vulnerable.

This was the first screening I got to enjoy as a member of the press at the New York Film Festival, and I'll admit, it wasn't the most thrilling start to the week. But the more I reflect on it, the more I'm glad I got to see it, and the more impressed I am by different elements like the performances and the cinematography. Because of its slow-moving pace and thin plot, Too Late to Die Young might not be everyone's perfect Friday night flick. But for subtlety, and the small, beautiful moments that make up the way childhood morphs into adolescence, it's a winner for sure.

5826,"A great documentary about China's infamous one-child policy. Though, the filmmaker sort-of trips over herself when she smuggles in the topic of American Abortion rights. Other than that awkward moment, it's a nearly perfect film that I'd recommend to anyone.",1
5827,Documentarian Nanfu Wang (whose name alluding to hopes for a son in the family) is a new mom whose own memories of China's one-child policy spanning 35 years led her to adventure upon the darkening trenches of a nation's harrowing extreme population control and its spine-chilling affliction on its people and their families.,1
5828,"Although everyone should see One Child Nation, this is perhaps especially important material for those raised in Western democracies while the one child policy (among many government decisions over many decades) ravaged our counterparts in China. I can't recommend this film any higher.",1
5829,"Nanfu criticises a regime but does not offer an alternative and gaslights Chinese opinions as ""brainwashed"" and invalidated their actual thoughts. Obviously biased. Can she please suggest how she would have tackled overpopulation.",0
5830,For a more objective and insightful analysis of the one child policy you'd be better off just reading the Wikipedia article on this topic. Don't waste your time with this documentary.,0
5831,Not fit for anti-abortion believers. Great work but it fails to reach any conclusion.,1
5832,"'One Child Nation' is a wide-reaching American documentary film directed by Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang about the fallout of China's one-child policy that lasted from 1979 to 2015.  It's illuminating and eye-opening and could change your mind on certain things while disgusting you at the same time.  No matter what your information level is on this subject, it's a great lesson to not believe everything the government tells you because they just could ruin the species.  Things are almost always done in someone's self-interest and while the filmmaker doesn't connect the dots in this case the self-interest lies in rich Chinese men.  There is no way to change the irreparable harm that's been done, but watching this rather large subject being consolidated to less than 90 minutes is a good start.  There's no one person portrayed that I felt connected to, but I did feel a symbiosis with the subject matter overall.  While there are disturbing images that may even go too far, it's another great doc in a year filled with them.  Final Score:  8.7/10",1
5833,"Important to see this perspective on the restrictions in China and the interesting work being done in Lehi, Utah to reconnect families.  Amazon was the medium.",0
5834,"A film about a country-wide problem giving us a personal look into it, but at the same time giving a broader view into the mostly unknow history, about that period of a not long time ago",1
5835,Wow what a great way to see how a country convince their entire population to follow a rule. I really enjoy this documentary and the way it's done so unique.,1
5836,"I just couldn't get into this film. I finally turned it off about halfway through after it seemed like nothing ever happened. It was interesting to see the main characters navigate the Turkish-speaking areas of northwestern Iran, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested.",0
5837,"Love the car as viewpoint, at one point the reflection of the mountainside bush in the half rolled up window.  Beautiful color palette in mountainous villages of Iran: tan, gold, blue.  Loved the billowing wraps the women wore. Great moments of tension and relief: the initial scene, 3 men approaching the car at night, hulking brother with a large stone in his hands.  One could say the entire movie was a relief.  Wonderful scenes of village hospitality, customs, and life, ""They're doing something there,"" unique images--the lighted eternal abode for instance.",1
5838,"A very gentle, slow moving, observational story that has an intriguing premise. The movie is more about the cultural aspects of the people that the main characters interact with on their journey to helping the young girl who triggers the journey. The acting is calm and understated and it is photographed almost as if we are just there watching as the events unfold. Behnaz Jafari is actually a famous actress in Iran and Jafar Panahi is an actual director who has was banned from making movies for 20 years in Iran due to a number of controversial films he made (controversial for Iran, I assume). The movie is filmed in a remote part of Iran that his parents come from. The movie won Best Screenplay at Cannes in 2018. If you are happy to be patient with a movie that moves along slowly and subtlety, it's worth a look.",1
5839,"Slow journey through the tradition and customs of the Iranian countryside, with various commentary on differences and history.",0
5840,"Jafar Panahi co-wrote, directed and stars as himself in '3 Faces', an Iranian film that worked for me until the third act.  I watched this with wife on a Hubby Wife Date Night and she felt the same way which makes this review much easier to construct.  It's beautiful and the story is alluring, but once the reveal happens we're not left with much more.  The problem is there's another 40 minutes of movie and what was once a cohesive and hypnotically beautiful film, becomes a slog.  Perhaps the final act will work for you, but for us not so much!  Hubby 6.6/Wife 6.0 Average Final Score: 6.3/10",0
5841,"Quizá para los que vivimos en tercer mundo no impacta mucho y puede resultar aburrida ya que no es nada muy nuevo. La historia es interesante y, desde su sencillez, esta bien narrada, pero a la final no resulta cautivante.",0
5842,"Just saw this at Toronto International Film Festival tonight and had to stop seeing any more films because I just wanted to absorb the profound meaning of what I think is Jafar Panahi's finest work sinee he has been denied passport privileges by the Iranian government. Exploring the 3 FACES of past, present and future Iranian actresses, he slowly reveals injustices to women imposed by uninformed traditions and government. Appreciation of the film is enhanced if viewers are aware of the double meaning of references to Iranian cinema, most importantly the career and fate of Shahrzaad, the Persian actress and poet.(See Shahn Parhami's Sharzaad's Story. Through metaphors, mastery camerawork, empathetic insights and brilliant storytelling, Jafar Panahi has smashed the limitations imposed upon him during his eighth  year of a 20 year  sentence to not travel or direct a film.",1

5873,"An incredible documentary. Growing up in the United States, real war has been a borderline alien experience for decades. People see it in film, romantacize it, view it through the lens of a political administration, but there hasn't been a real threat of domestic combat for generations; as a concept, it largely belongs to long-passed generations. Likewise, foreign wars are presented largely as statistics or in broad, remote geopolitical terms, as if those involved were somehow not human, that there suffering somehow is not significant. For Sama forces viewers to confront the reality that terrible conflict is an everyday reality for some, and it does so by demonstrating a universal, heartbreaking humanity within the victims of the conflict. When that child is born in a war-ravaged Aleppo hospital with blue skin and no hint of life, only to be woken by the dedicated efforts of the doctors after harrowing minutes, it is a devastating moment, particularly within the context that it creates. The film is so profound, if I was unaware of the circumstances behind its production I would have immediately assumed that it was a docudrama. I can't recall an objectively better found-footage style documentary; others, like Grey Gardens and Hoop Dreams are shot with an intimate style and follow an evolving storyline, but they are still at their core professional productions made by commercial film crews that set out to document a very particular event that they had previously scouted, vetted, and decided upon. For Sama doesn't feel like that, it has senses of pure violence, danger, and loss that can only originate from a devastating event. A true must-watch. (5/5)",1
5874,"An impressive documentary about an impressive young couple. Amazing how numbed everyone becomes by the constant death and destruction. The absolute state of Aleppo by the time they're leaving is incredible. If ever there was an anti-war film this inadvertently is it. Being on the ground through the siege showcases the truth of war. There's no glamour, it's just pure misery and suffering.",1

They stay for months after the baby is born, even if the situation has gotten worse over the last few years. At a point 7 out of 8 hospitals in the area are bombed to bits and now they go all in on the place they live and treat thousand of people.

This is such a devastating piece. Dead bodies, crying family, bombs and blood. This is the naked truth. I'm so impressed with these people and get so angry with the surroundings and people causing them. This is just as painful as it is important.
It has gotten loads of awards but naturally the Academy cowardly did not handled them anything accept from the nomination.

5878,"Even though its very nicely made, its misleading and deceptive propaganda, makes it worthless as a documentary. The  brutality of various extremist rebel groups should have been a part of the story, and you get the feeling Hamza might be sympathetic towards the extremists, who were probably even more brutal, intolerant and barbaric than the Assadregime.",0
5879,What a horrible thing wars are. Why would someone have kids in such times?,1
5880,"One would expect an Academy Awards-nominated documentary to unveil the facts of the underlying story in all their complexity, which would set it aside from the shallow propaganda pouring from all sides. But this film, regretfully, is just another example of how disinformation and obfuscation of facts continues to be used to bend public attitudes (western public, mostly) toward the war conflict in a very particular way, emphasizing one part of the story and conveniently hiding all others, keeping things simple and black and white for the viewer. 

The rebels are portrayed as innocent civilians playing chess, cooking dinner, getting married, having to hide during brutal Russian airstrikes, which aim at hospitals to break their will and take away their freedom. Of course there is some truth in this narrative, but there is also so much more to the story, and without that, this half-truth simply becomes a lie. It isn't the peaceful freedom-seeking rebels who hold the city against the government army for so long; and it isn't the hospitals that the Russian (and American, conveniently not mentioned in the film) airstrikes were targeting during that war. In reality that was a highly complex multi-sided war, which went way beyond an internal civil conflict, much of it being the war against ISIL, and the events of the film are in the middle of that war. By sympathizing with ISIL extremists, the film chooses to turn a blind eye to the endless crimes against humanity which these extremists committed, and simply paint the the government and the Russians as the villains of the story. 

The real drama of this ""documentary"" is that disinformation, propaganda, double standards - which this film is full of - were among the very things that the 2011 revolution was originally fighting AGAINST...",0

Macedonia is like anywhere else in Europe for most people but there remains a large minority of the population who live this earthy existence. What amazes me is just how diverse their life skills are and how brilliantly improvisational they are. They approach nature with no fear and are at one with heir surroundings whereas most of us all n the modern world would be lost without the usual trappings. I'd last a couple of days in my own in the wild whereas yo this lot it's just easy. Reminds me how much health and safety has contorted our perceptions of risk…much for the worse.

5890,"Wow! Amazing documentary with heart and soul. We have no idea how hard others have it in the World. This was mesmerizing and unique. The message kicked you in the gut. ''Don't take it all'' or it just won't work. Mankind tends to be a greed monger. These two women who lived simply could teach us all a lesson in kindness, conservation, responsibility, wit, and tenacity. I loved it.",1
5891,"As documentaries go, this is a pretty straight forward one, showing the filming of a gospel concert with Aretha Franklin and the Southern Californian Community Choir in the early 1970s. The singing is undoubtedly great and its nice to see the atmosphere in the small, church, venue - its quite infectious even, although, obviously, in a good way!. The songs are quite atmospheric and I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself tapping your toes to the various catchy tunes, such as 'Mary, Don't You Weep', 'What A Friend We Have in Jesus' and the titular 'Amazing Grace'. 

The picture is slightly grainy I suppose but then, of course, this was recorded some time ago and I guess you could say it adds to the sentimentality/nostalgic aspect of it. I thought it was a bit of a shame that there's no additional information about the singers life given alongside the performances - I suppose I assume that music documentaries will include more than 'just' the music itself but that's not to say that it's not a good, uplifting, entertaining and enjoyable musical performance because it is. I suppose I think of it more like a concert film than a music documentary as such. In any case, she certainly had a pretty amazing voice and she made the most of it. I appreciate and respect that, having seen this film. For fans of Aretha Franklin's music, I would most certainly recommend this, yes.",1

5895,"This really wasn't Aretha's film for me. I don't think it captured her full power, which is why it wasn't released when she was alive. Aretha is Aretha, though, and the magnitude of catching any of her performances in a time capsule is worthwhile.

The real star of this one, the man I had to look up after because his charisma was undeniable, was Reverend James Cleveland. If you search for his live Gospel performances (you can find full captures of his Sunday Service online), you will be captivated by him and all his little vocal ticks like shushing the congregation. He is my Reverend from back in time, and I'm forever thankful for Aretha introducing me to him.",1

5901,"Boring, unrealistic characters and plot, 3 y.o. diaologues.",0
5902,"This is very much a bleak and sometimes quite gritty film. Its got a mostly urban setting and by the end its somewhat introspective. The main protagonist seems quite mysterious, which intrigued me a bit. I felt myself rooting for her at times. I did feel the film seemed a bit directionless at times, plot wise, which didn't help.

As I say, there's a sobering side to what goes on, the principles and morals that are discussed. It's not a film that I found entirely memorable or would want to watch again but its ok. It had a bit of a feel of An Elephant Sitting Still, I thought. I'm not sure what else I could say but I'd only recommend it to people quite familiar with these sorts of films, who are prepared to give it a shot, if you know what I mean.",1
5903,"I liked it, though I was left feeling mostly just...sad, by the end. I found the characters a little too perplexing to love this film, but it is also one that has left me thinking about it a lot, so my opinion will probably only improve with time. At the end, I was left asking “but WHY?”. Given time to mull on it, I can see how deliberately this film follows the bigger themes of personal alienation and national alienation (I’m paraphrasing other reviews) as China develops and changes at an incredible pace. ",1
5904,"The movie is totally disjointed and utterly disappointing, although it's interesting to see the Chinese culture.",0
5905,"An honorable act of self sacrifice goes ignored, thus the plot of this film is propelled. Qiao's journey to find her man is kind of interesting in regards to the people she meets, but what I found really interesting here was the depiction of modern jianghu, which can have many interpretations as it turns out.",0
5906,"Ash Is Purest White (In China as Sons and Daughters of Jianghu) is a Chinese film by director Jia Zhangke.   It is slow and long with  more interesting backgrounds and weird asides .  The plot is whisper thin (girl falls for low level gangster who treats her poorly at three different points of her life).  The film is more about the change that occured in rural China in that time.   While I don't share the love that some critics have for this film (or the directors other works) , I do appreciate the glimpse of a different part of China.  (2 1/2 stars out of 5) but if you don't like leasurily drama knock a star off, if you liked the directors other films than add a star",0
5907,Ash Is Purest White is an Masterpiece of Film Art. Zhangke Jia has Directec and written this so good and how they sometimes staged the Scenes for instance when they turn the Score louder and everything else is getting quieter and quieter. The Movie looked fantastic as well so props to the Cinematographer. Acting was pretty good as well but I think unfortunately not everyone appreciates Film Art (or just doesn't likes that which is obviously totally Ok) but it's definitely a total recommendation.,1
5908,"Ash is Purest White is an epic morality tale of retribution and regret. It's large in scope although certain sections of the film feel a little disjointed. Director Jia Zhangke is ambitious in his delivery if not totally successful. It starts as a mobster tale in the Chinese city of Datong. Bin is an ambitious mob boss. His girlfriend Qiao is very loyal to him. After Bin's boss is murdered, danger encircles both of them. They are attacked by a marauding group of motorcycle riders, but Qiao is actually the one sent to prison as she fires a gun at them. This sets in motion a story that spans the next fifteen years and the film becomes a melodrama of regret and consequences. As said the film doesn't lack in ambition but I felt the pacing was a bit muddled. The true shining light though is Zhao Tao as Qiao. She lights up the screen everytime she appears.",1
5909,Zhao Tao and Liao Fan combine for two fantastic performances in the surprisingly flat Chinese drama 'Ash is the Purest White'.   There's a blend of gangster film and romance and what it lacks in narrative structure it makes up for in heart.  It certainly didn't feel like a movie that was north of two hours and 15 minutes which is why we give this a slight recommendation.  Final Score: 6.8/10,1

I have no scientific or technical knowledge at all but found this completely accessible, hypnotic and gripping. Some of the footage is truly remarkable, and there are some small revelations - like that Armstrong's heart rate at the point of touchdown on the moon was 156 - that give the most human of light and shade to a story that is so out of reach to all of us. To those of us, like me, not alive when this happened, this is a thrilling watch.",1
5914,"I agree with the New Yorker review.  Amazing footage, but the lack of narration and contextualization made it kind of boring and hard to get through.",1
5915,Incredibly well done doc. As if we were sitting on the front row seat to the moon.,1
5916,"A masterpiece documenting mankind's greatest achievement: masterfully edited, splicing together well-known and newly discovered archival footage, the beautifully restored film makes much of this documentary appear as if it was filmed 5 years ago, not 50. Absent commentary, aside from minimal additions from Walter Cronkite's coverage that adds just a sprinkle of necessary context, the story is driven by the tense moments inherent in such a monumental mission; the take-off, transfer to the lunar modual, the landing, and the splashdown. Despite knowing the outcome (""No way...that's great! We landed on the moon!""), the superb editing injected natural tension and suspense for nearly the entire 93 minutes. You can feel the enormity of the mission at hand on the faces of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins as they suit up prior to launch. One of the greatest Oscar snubs of recent memory for not taking Best Documentary.",1

Well directed, but I didn't like any of the characters, I thought they were all pretty horrible people. I'm glad I watched it, but it's not something I would watch again, and I definitely wouldn't have picked it for the Oscar. Seems more like a win base on politics than the actual best movie of the year. Was a really disappointing time at the theaters. I probably should have waited for this to land on streaming and watched it at home instead of the theaters, and even then I'm not sure it's worth my time.",0
5930,Very unusual movie advertised as a comedy but it was not a comedy.  Korean movies are typically not good and this one while unusual was marginally Ok.  It is amazing that it was an Oscar winner,0

Predictable dialogue",0
5932,"This is a bleak film, which had a couple of surprisingly poignant moments towards the end, in terms of the situations/scenarios and, primarily, the dialogue. I quite liked the cinematography, although it is certainly cliched and perhaps somewhat predictable. The plot is a little plodding and I wouldn't say this is more than a reasonably good film but yes, it's ok, though I wouldn't go out of your way to see it as such, no.",0
5933,"Excellent film.  I was impressed by the amount of research/homework the writer put into Anaconda area.  Very real portrayal of what it can be like to live in an abusive home in small town USA.  Stories like this one are happening all too often, all around us.  Really, liked the main character and thought the abusive dad both were very convincing.  Also appreciated how the film incorporated folks from Anaconda into the film.",1
5934,"Chance watch while browsing the movie list on C4, always been intrigued by ‘coming of age' storylines however in recent years, too many films of this genre have been either predictable, vanilla or focused on stereotypical topics. 
The main actor is fabulous at telling us just enough about the challenging relationship with her father and her background.  An excellent  performance also by the male  playing Hank/father and the actor in the role as steady boyfriend, both setting  a believable scenario without any overly dramatic or far fetched narrative.
Can't quite understand why the friend with benefits character is British but I guess he suited the directors intent, again bringing a feeling of what life is as a young adult/teenager and the choices you make. Great watch!",1

5936,"a superb indie film with great acting. A film about a young teenager who turns 18 looking after her ex-veteran father who suffers from mental illnesses passed on to him from war. It shows the ups and downs within their Father-Daughter relationship and his high dependency on her to take care of him whilst she herself is trying to find/is searching for her OWN independency. A well done drama, semi coming of age type esk movie, about life. Would definitely recommend.",1

5938,"Camila Morrone and James Badge Dale have a fantastic chemistry as daughter and daddy in 'Mickey and the Bear, but how did hubby and wife's date night chemistry turn out after watching the film?  That's for another column.  Hubby and wife are both willing to recommend this one but wife is a little higher on the film than hubby. Wife:  the movie was sufficiently distressing - Mickey was convincingly tormented as the daughter of an addict.  I would have given it a higher score if we knew more about their back story.  However, the plot line didn't leave me wanting for more - just long enough, but not special enough.  Hubby:  There are plot holes you could drive a truck through, but it's worth seeing the performance of Morrone.  I wish there was a little more on the page.  Too many through away characters and unanswered questions.  Hubby: 6.1 Wife: 7.9 Average: 7.0/10",1

5941,"This is very much an indie/b-movie film. I can see that it's trying to challenge peoples view of disfigured people or that it's criticising the stereotypical depiction of this in films but I didn't feel the film really 'worked'. There's not enough strong plot direction. The plot synopsis says ""A beautiful actress struggles to connect with her disfigured co-star on the set of a European auteur's English-language debut."" yet the actress doesn't seem to struggle to connect with the disfigured actor at all, as far as I could tell, indeed they seem to get on ok, so I don't understand that. This must be meant to be some kind of parody of b-movies or the like but I didn't find it especially amusing or even really all that thought provoking. 

Anyway, I'm not too bothered about peoples looks, for the record, I was more confused about the plot direction - it felt a bit aimless and certainly was neither memorable, not did it have any strong impact on me personally, so I wouldn't recommend this, no. A bit niche perhaps?. I'm not sure how comfortable I'd feel thinking of seriously deformed or disfigured people as being the title of this film - chained for life. I'd like to think people wouldn't feel so removed from society purely due to their face not fitting in to what people in western society regard as acceptable but seeing this film hasn't changed my viewpoints on any of that sort of thing. I wouldn't recommend this film, that's all I can really say.",0

Jess Weixler has been waiting for that breakout roll and she finds it here.  It's a fantastic lead duo, but it's a movie about a movie and that's been done better way too many times.  It's artistically gorgeous, and visually stunning, but it just miles away from best in its field.  Thanks to the will power of the two stars it's completely watchable and enjoyable!

Highly recommended for film lovers that enjoy European cinema or indies that take you on a completely unexpected journey.",1

She pay little interest in her anoying co-workers as they keep telling her that she can buy stupid things from them for ""special"" prices. We meet a few occational weird guests, but mostly this is plain forward and doesn't bring the most exciting or special scenes. It's constructed in a way that this is not very needed, this is super authentic, slightly fascinating, a bit monotonous with all the routines but it manage to stay interesting, thanks to a great lead.

It reminds me of Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma"", just shorter and a bit less dramatic.

It doesn't overstay it's welcome and it's cerebral.  It's not for everyone and frankly I'm kinda surprised I liked it.  It's different and fresh and for that reason you should give it a shot.

5962,"This generation's Blair Witch Project. Not because it created a new subgenre or because it's particularly scary, but due to the fact that it racked up more ticket sales than its budget to an almost impossible degree; a $25,000 movie that took in more than $30,000,000. 

I went in totally blind to the layers that were going to be on display in this film, which ended up delivering a twist on the zombie and zomedy genres through multiple meta aspects - showing a film, then diving into the creative inspiration behind it and then ultimately the behind-the-scenes footage, weaving in jokes about the sporadic nature of creating a film, the tricks of the trade, and the slip-ups along the way. It's as much about the development process as it is about the zombie flick that it lovingly satirizes, and the film also features a legitimate long take as its central device (a fully contained short film running 37 minutes in length), which is an impressive enough feat on its own, but then the film has this surprisingly elaborate structure that sets up not only multifaceted characters but an interesting design (if you count the end credits, I think this film ends up four Inception layers deep, a director creating a film about a director creating a film about a director creating a film about zombies).

I'm not sure it's a herald of a shift in filmmaking style that the consistently high praise seems to suggest, but it certainly is clever and fun. (3.5/5)",1

That's not the gold i mean probably most of people guessed it as well as me but that's not even the point the actual point is how beautifly they have showed us the films are made, how smooth it was. I can definitely say that i haven't enjoyed watching an outro of a movie for a long time.",1
5968,"(SPOILER WARNING)

It's hard to talk about this film without spoiling it, so I'm not going to try. With so many zombie films being released each year, it's hard to find a modern one that has an original voice, but this film aces that. For the first 35 minutes, the film feels really trashy. The acting is bad, the direction feels awkward, and several scenes seem out of place and confusing. I didn't dislike the first act of the film though. Rather, I found it funny and had a good time with it. After the film appears to end though (in spite of an hour of the film remaining), it's revealed that the ""movie production gone wrong"" element of the first act was actually just a film crew shooting a film. The remainder of the film shows us the behind the scenes footage of the film crew preparing for and shooting the film. While the middle act dragged for me somewhat (this is the only part of the film I had an issue with), the final half hour brings everything home. There, we see the filming of One Cut of the Dead from the perspectives of both the actors and the crew members. It's in this portion of the film where we learn of all the mishaps which occurred during production which the crew had to work around. For example, two cast members got in a car crash on the day of filming and had to be replaced at the last minute, one actor was drunk and another actor had diarrhea during filming, the main cameraman suffered a back injury in the middle of the film and had to be replaced, one actress went off-script and began actually attacking several people, and a camera crane they planned to use for the final shot broke, requiring for the crew to form a human pyramid to improvise. While One Cut of the Dead initially seemed like a trashy horror film, the final act showed why it was as trashy as it was. So many things went wrong while shooting the film and the film crew only managed to finish it by the skin of their teeth. Given all these mishaps, the movie production gone wrong element of the first act was technically real. Just for a different reason than what I had initially suspected. Overall, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. In spite of my issue with the middle act, I found the rest of it really clever and I'm glad I watched it.",1

They are saving lives but risk everything. The stuff they are doing is not legal and they are not even making much money of it. Police want a bribing share and if things ends up badly they are in even bigger trouble as they kind of murder the patients - at least not giving them the best treatment by qualified medical workers.
We are in the amulance for most of the time. They wait, they eat, they rush around in traffic towards emergencies.

I kind of feel for the family. Sure, they do it for the money but as the real health care has not nearly enough cars they are kind of needed. Sometimes they get payed, sometime they don't. They won't even know until the patient is brought to the hospital - often private ones. They question out the victims next of kin and lead them into giving away as much money as possible.
A very good documentary that is just as wrong as it is right.

5981,"There is a distinct and saddening lack of documentaries around World War 1 that covers not the events of the conflict, but the people involved in it. ""They Shall Not Grow Old"", however, covers only the experiences of the common British soldiers who fought in it. It does not waste time with detailing any battle or engagement, instead giving a broad overview perspective of the soldiers who fought and lived through the experience. Unlike many of the documentaries that detail something regarding the Second World War, and usually some leading hero or heroes in an engagement, there are no heroes in this documentary, which brings the entirety of the film to a ground level, one where you WILL, not can, sympathize and emphasize with the soldiers as they recount the tragedy, loss, victories, and joys of the war in all of their accounts and the scenes of death, dismay, and hopelessness shown throughout. It is a beautifully moving documentary, and I cannot recommend watching it enough.",1

5989,"A remarkable fusion of visual imagery and spoken word. The movie takes the old archive film from the Great War which was black and white and rather jerky, and colourises it and remasters the motion to give it much more natural pace and fluidity. This needs to be emphasized, it is not just that the old film has been colourized, it is the work to correct motion effects that makes such a transformation. And by using tapes of veterans articulating their own memories and thoughts it has an authenticity and balance that very few films about the Great War can match. There is an emotional power which makes for compelling viewing and a very powerful experience. Forget polemics, re-fighting old wars and making history fit modern political issues, this simply gives a voice to those who fought and is all the better for it. Cannot be recommended highly enough.",1

It's just not about having the feeling of Nostalgia with all the characters, movies and retro games but it has a great overall story on why they need to fine the keys. What made everything exciting in this movie is that we go to see watch everything goes down in real time and not being someone narrating something that has already happened in the past tense like Thor Love and Thunder with Korg which at first when I hear the main character narrate the beginning but then it was just for a better explanation which actually worked in its favour. Like I said they didn't have to give us such amazing graphics for the VR world because we would have understood that is all VR so it doesn have to look realistic but the details are impeccable you could even see all the dots and lines on their faces and all characters really popped especially the end battle. 
The sound is absolutely solid, infact I found myself lowing the volume because it was absolutely epic and loud and the bass was just amazing making my subwoofer rattle things around it making the scenes sound feel cinematic. 
Steven Spielberg outdid himself with this movie. It is fun, exciting and full of Nostalgia. A winner in my book.",1

It is always hard to talk about a mystery without spoiling it, but I can say this is probably on the lower half of the acceptable mysteries I've watched, ""Clue"" probably still being the highest.

It's a little fun to watch an ""every"" (wo)man do this sort of investigation work to solve a murder, but having it be the accused (it's part of the premise) feels really old hat (cliche), and it takes some effort on my part.

Having the detective have some extra pizazz (sp?) always spices up research roles like this for me: she just didn't have enough personality to compensate.

Imagine Rebel Wilson as the accused murderer who has to solve her best friend (and employer's) murder or go to jail. There, I've already written a better movie, not that this one is bad.",0

But it all falls apart with no real bang of a murder mystery. The best word to describe the movie that I can come up with is vapid. The cinematography is nice and the actors play excellent roles, it is the script and directing that killed this film. This movie could have been so much more.",0
6011,"This is quite a philosophical watch. Its a slow paced film and may bore some people but I liked it in terms of the characters, with the eccentric Alberto Giacometti and his curious final subject, the art lover James Lord. Its a bit of a thoughtful watch, with some good dialogue and I found it intriguing seeing how the two main characters  got on and regarded each other as the days went by, while he worked on his painting.

Its partially subtitled, being set in France, so thats worth knowing in case subtitles are a bit put off to you but it didn't especially bother me. The majority of the dialogue is in English, with the two main characters obviously talking in English, so subtitles are only present some of the time. There is definitely a cat and mouse aspect to the painter and the, I suppose, paintee. There is an element of fragility and of stubbornness present too but I won't say anymore so as not to risk giving any spoilers.

I quite liked the musical score, with numerous classical pieces played, that helped to heighten the viewers sense of the characters state of mind at the time. I'd recommend this film if your ok with slow paced, partially subtitled films.",1

6016,"Geoffrey Rush, Armie Hammer, and Clemence Poesy are wasted in this boring film.  The film runs 90 minutes.  It feels like 90 hours.  A Swiss painter living in Paris is painting a portrait of a journalist.  The painter paints, smokes, swears, and starts over; paints smokes, seas, and starts over, paints, smokes, swears, and starts over.  Nothing of any interest occurs.  Easily one of the most boring films I ever have sat through.  How I wish I had followed the urge to bail on this after about the first ten minutes.  I stupidly kept thinking something of interest was going to happen.  This is based on real life painter and sculpture Alberto Giacometti whose ""art"" is as bad as this film.",0
6017,"Very good acting led by Rush, Hammer, and Shalhoub. However, be prepared for a film that can be trying at times with its disjointed storyline and most deliberate pacing. For me, the subtle humor and eccentric, unpredictable, and full of life characters made it worth the experience.",0
6018,I enjoyed this look into the life of an artist. I particularly enjoyed views of his studio and his interactions with his American friend. But I didn't much care for his selfish and egotistical behavior and the abysmal way he treated his wife. The film seems to me to be a pretty honest account of Giacometti's final years.,1
6019,"This film is a slow study of the madness that is repetitious perfectionism by someone who is neither mad nor perfect. Geoffrey Rush carries the emotional torment well while Arnie Hammer is forced to checkmate his painter's moves.  With a pleasant surprise, Tony Shalhoub plays the tempered brother who rides sidecar to Giacometti's creative vortex. I really enjoyed this film for Tucci's gift of ponderance, poise, and placent appreciation of film making and a glimpse into the head of most artists i've known. It's not for everyone but offers something different in a world of superhero mashups.",1

6037,"So it opens with one girl drawing a penis on the other girl's face, they get up and walk into the other room and now the penis is gone? What? Is there any rhyme or reason anymore?

Let's forget that we have to believe these girls are playing 16 despite them being 21/25 respectfully . Let's also forget that no one would actually behave the way these girls do. Let's also pretend we believe that her mom is out hooking in the street right in front of their house. The brother is a dealer, and she seems to have a problem with that despite her raunchy behavior and herself doing drugs?

Their relationship? Ambiguous. It's one situation after the other that is just so ridiculously not believable. All this stuff happened within 12 minutes. Two young black guys break into the house and trying to get money owed and then steals an OLD TV, because that's what they would do. And then the insanely unfunny cop scene. All enough to turn it off before the 15 minute mark. One cop had a 70s porn mustache. right... 70s porn mustache.. None of it made any sense.... A24 get it together!!!

It has a pretty interesting cast consisting of Channing Tatum, Zendaya and LeBron James. I'm not too impressed about the creature design (which can still be improved to look cuter or more adorable), but the story is unexpectedly smart and beautiful. It has a powerful message about belief, division, tolerance and seeking the truth. The humor is mostly slapstick, but it still made me laugh a couple of times. The script is clever and there are a few nice original tunes. It's deeper than your usual 3D animation and it has a beautiful message that even adults would appreciate.",1

Before We Vanish is a spectacle that is so intriguing, full of drama, but a plot that tends to be in slow. In some scenes, there is an obvious plot hole and there is so much waste of times. For the rest, this is a horror, thriller, and drama movie. A film about understanding the nature of human complexity and what's actually missing.",1
6064,"It is unsettling to follow two characters trigger conceptual thoughts about the self to a confused character, when you know it will end in the theft of said concept from their mind. This is one of the most effective scenes from the movie âBefore we Vanishâ? by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. He manages to blend a down-to-earth narrative with an alien invasion exquisitely well, and explores how we define ourselves through themes and concepts. However, it lacks a bit in execution and falls a bit short of how far it could have taken itself.

Thereâ(TM)s no doubt that there is enough of a baseline to create a more lengthy piece on what this type of invasion might look like, and though it may have ended up even more dystopian it likely would have been more satisfying. In terms of narrative strengths, this film carries compelling character dynamics and, aside from those, the second-most powerful attraction of this film is the theme of conceptual gain and loss. In what is most likely an attempt to narrow down the narrative focus within the confines of a movie, Kurosawa keeps two groups within an arm's length of each-other and contrasts the differences in theme between them through humour, warmth and a little bit of ambivalence following some of the more provocative moments of the movie.

The visual language is simple but effective. It makes good use of a fairly pale color pallette and has a clear understanding of the concepts behind camera placement and technique. But if you go into this movie expecting a visual spectacle youâ(TM)ll be fairly disappointed. In the end, however, that would be counter intuitive to the overall movie language that flows throughout this film. At moments the cinematography attempts some shocking moments, but while it never really excels at shocking its audience it does a good job at creating highly uncomfortable scenarios by taking its time to expose the audience to philosophical scenarios. A striking to me was the one described in the beginning of this text, where the prolonged exposure to what the audience by then has come to recognize as a hostile act being acted out in a playful act, similar to how a cat can play with a mouse before devouring it.

There isnâ(TM)t anything spectacular going on with the music or audio cues throughout the movie however, something that feels like it could have been considered for more subtle effects. But perhaps, much like an overt cinematography, it would have taken away some of the essence of the film in its way of narrowing its focus down on dialogue and philosophy, as is a common pillar in Japanese cinematography.

Thinking, conceptualizing, communicating, these are aspects of humanity that can be very complex and the movie does a good job of grinding them down to more easily digestible and tangible pieces. It speaks clearly through its colorful cast, ambiguous alien mindsets and fairly straight-forward story beats. If youâ(TM)re on the lookout for something a bit out of the ordinary, but which wonâ(TM)t cause too much confusion, or if youâ(TM)re not too used to philosophical movie escapades, then this movie might be right up your alley. Itâ(TM)s a film which doesnâ(TM)t concern itself with too much melodramatic, but which speaks a language that can appeal to a larger group, perhaps a for families that want to engage in something other than the typical action film or comedy relief. And perhaps, it could also fit those who are looking to enjoy a chill philosophical derivative at the end of their day.",1

6068,"Comprehensive documentary explores Westwood's fashion, career and downfalls and still gives us a good portrait of a fascinating and complex artist. ",1
6069,"- Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist - the life of the last, real punk -

Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist is one of the best movies I have seen this season. The documentary took me on an emotional rollercoaster - I felt as though I was holding hands with Vivienne Westwood (British Fashion Designer of the Year 1990, 1992 and 2006), living her life with her. I laughed, I cried, and even felt righteous indignation in a scene when someone brought her the wrong fabric.

The movie opens on a disgruntled Westwood speaking with off-screen director Lorna Tucker (Amá). We quickly find through Westwood's disinterest in her own story, that she is intent on telling the details her way. ""Do we have to have every bit of it, it's so boring to say all of it. I'm totally bored doing this stuff, but you need it so I'll tell you.""

She takes us from the beginning, the Sex Pistols days, right through to some of her most recent work. Along the way, we are introduced to her then boyfriend Malcolm McLaren (manager of the Sex Pistols) who, through sabotage, skyrockets Westwood's career. We also meet her now husband and colleague Andreas Kronthaler, who works with her to produce items for the runway.

By letting the audience know from the very beginning that the documentary isn't based around forced questioning, rather, Westwood explaining her story in her own time, the film feels deeply authentic. The events flow more or less in chronological order from decade to decade, supported with footage from Westwood's shows and workrooms.

There are also interviews of some of her colleagues and her two sons, who provided an inside look into the Westwood's life journey. We hear a lot from her oldest son, Ben, who tells us how the early years of his mother's careers were harder than people realized. Westwood was seen as a powerhouse, but behind closed doors, she struggled with motherhood, a sense of identity, and juggling her passion with work, just like a regular person.

The message of perseverance is intertwined throughout the documentary, though it is never mentioned. Seeing Westwood's bravery to go after her dreams even when told that her ideas were ridiculous, made me think, what would we be able to achieve as a race if we followed our dreams instead of the restrictions of society? Tucker managed to capture the rebellious nature of Westwood, her ambition, the near recklessness of her decisions, in a way that kept me on the edge of my seat.

However, I found the lack of activism in the movie disappointing. Westwood has evolved to be more than just a fashion designer. She is an advocate of many social injustices. She fights for the rights of the LGBT community, the environment, and gender norms. Some of her more recent activism is shown, but considering that Westwood's latest collections revolve around her advocacy (she recently released a line of unisex clothing to highlight gender norms) it's strange that Tucker didn't include more of it. It feels as if Tucker missed out on giving the audience a full image of who Westwood is now.

Watching Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist, I felt encouraged to go and chase my dreams, no matter how ridiculous they seem to everyone else. I've always dreamed to go to culinary school, and what's stopping me? Tucker and Westwood showed me that the road to success is not glamorous nor is it easy, but the way Westwood now fights for the rights of those less acknowledged, and is uncompromising in her vision, proves the end product is rewarding enough for it to be worth it.

6070,Interesting documentary of a fascinating character. It definitely reflects her personality. But doesn’t go deep enough into her art and her relevance,1
6071,"liked the film, don't like her.",1
6072,Loved it. Some great catwalk footage I'd never seen before plus incredibly funny as she's so grumpy and just doesn't want to be interviewed.,1
6073,"Amazing, inspiring and funny in equal measure.",1
6074,"This is a really quite edgy, gritty and raw type thriller film, with Nicole Kidman giving a strong performance in the main lead, as a very determined officer, willing to do whatever it takes to ger her target. It has the feel of a somewhat underground film, not so much that its a b-movie in tone but more in terms of the plot details, the dark tone of it I suppose. Its not entirely a film with lots of glitz and glamour, of course. I felt Kidman was very convincing in this film and it felt quite engrosing, although the somewhat shaky camerawork at times did put me off a little. Its relatively absorbing and intriguing, plot wise, with the viewer slowly learning more about Erin Bells background as the film continues.

The incidental music played, mostly edgy stringed instrument type music (like that used in Hitchcock films), is relatively good at adding to the general sense of uncertainty and the doubt of who will be the first to blink, if you know what I mean, although it is perhaps a little loud now and again. In that sense, its quite intriguing, even 'mean and moody'. I suppose Kidmans character is someone that many parents and police officers may/can relate to, to one extent or another. Its a relatively fast paced (if in short bursts) and frantic watch, raw and well characterised film which I'd recommend.",1
6075,"Repulsive looking character in a socially just movie is decent and believable because she is a very flawed character that in no way is overpowering.  The structure is very irregular and that does hurt it given that the only constant is the strung-out and hideous looking lead character.  Manages to intrigue enough through the ending which, while not exactly disappointing, is too drawn out and melodramatic.  Previews definitely oversold it.",0
6076,"Barely recognisable, Kidman is superb leading this crime thriller; her character could easily have been a clichéd, bitter cop but her performance adds significant depth. This, along with the writing (especiallly in regards to Kidman's character's relationships) mean we're consistently left uncertain how this will play out in all parts of the plot. The flashback devices work well, sustaining that sense of suspense and uncertainty. Thus would, of course, he better regarded if it wasn't directed by and led by women, but that's where we are.",1
6077,Incredible - great story and Nicole is just amazing in this.,1
6078,"It's the Nicole Kidman show as she is the central figure in this timeline-jumbled cop drama weaving in scenes from the past (an undercover assignment gone awry) and the present (a homicide investigation). The shifting timeline makes things confusing, but it ultimately pays off in the end.",0
6079,"This is just about the most contrived movie I've ever seen: Kidman's prosthetics and makeup to make her look like a drunken hag; her overacted, surly, attitude; overdone, stereotypical bad guys. Totally fake and unconvincing. Plus, are we supposed to believe that the L.A. police department actually allows her to carry a badge?

This film tries way too hard to achieve some kind of gritty realism, but it's just phony Hollywood crap.",0
6080,Horrible.  Nicole Kidman walking around like a zombie the whole time.  Storyline boring.....another Kill Bill movie???  gimme a break!,0
6081,"Tries too hard to be credible. A detective this wated for this long in her career would have been off the force a long time ago. Too much of a liability to the City. The stereotypes and cliches are numerous and render the story boring, slow, and predictable. It seems Kidman's character literally never sleeps, perhaps passes out once in a while, never goes home, and never bathes. No one would take this person seriously in the real world as an effective law officer, much less as an effective person. With all due respect, if this had been Mark Wahlberg instead of Nicole Kidman, the movie would have been thoroughly panned.",0
6082,This film tells a well worn story in an elliptical fashion that is not always satisfying and motivation is sometimes pencilled in or unclear. That said it has a remarkable performance from Kidman that drives the film forwards and makes it very watchable. I was not quite sure how to rate it but in this case I think the performance holds it together to some extent nullifying unsure direction and screenplay.,1
6083,"A detective thriller where the plot develops as the film unfolds. We do not understand until the end the real motivation of our strange heroine. Very well played by Nicole as usual, who is unrecognizable.",1
6084,"Another WTF ending. Definitely French with all its bizarre (but visually appealing) camera shots, but story is lacking any relevant information to make it interesting. Could of and should of been better.",0
6085,"Style overload and a self inducing migraine of a story and direction, I think an interesting idea got very lost in ego ",0
6086,"LET THE CORPSES TAN is stylistic, very much in the vein of 70s action. It has abrupt plot changes. Sometimes it's like the audience in suffering the heat of the desert, sometimes it's like watching an art film. It's not that weird. I had no problem tracking who's who and what's going on. That's a smoother ride than some. It's mostly the arthouse style and shoestring budget that gives it its flavor.",0
6087,"Worth watching if you like weird surrealistic images or weird looking french people...but  minimal plot, froggy weirdness, and wonky pacing wont make it easy",0
6088,So much style here and technical prowess here. Even more fun if you know the genres being homage-d. ,1
6089,"This Belgian film reminds me a lot of the Italian Gallio genre of the 70s, mixed with experimental art techniques. But, this film I too ""style over substance"" for its own good. It's true that it's very created, but it then turns into a very bizarre film, which stops it from telling its original story, which is a big problem. It can get long very quickly, even though it's only 1h30. It's not at all your normal shoot-out flick, it's a unique viewing for sure, but there's only so much art you can take before it actually because a problem for the movie. Overall, if youre curious enough you can check it out, butI don't think I'll be revisiting this film any time soon...",0
6090,"Otra gran ejercicio de estilo de Cattet y Forzani, mucho mÃ¡s directo y simple en comparaciÃ³n a trabajos anteriores, aunque sin duda nada sencillo para un pÃºblico que no estÃ (C) dispuesto a entrar en la propuesta de este duo de cineastas que casi funcionan como catedrÃ¡ticos de gÃ (C)neros ya olvidados.

Cierto es que en esta ocasiÃ³n su historia es mÃ¡s simple y ciertas elecciones, en especial en su ediciÃ³n, son algo mÃ¡s toscas y burdas; pero como suele ser habitual la fotografÃ­a es mÃ¡s que buena y su trabajo sonoro es exquisito hasta niveles poca veces visto.

Si os gusta el cine de Sergio Leone, el giallo o soy unos locos de la ediciÃ³n y postproducciÃ³n de sonido, esta es una pelÃ­cula que tenÃ (C)is que ver.",1
6091,"Fascinating structure forcing the viewer to go with the flow, and accept that perspective as a possible one.  Lushly depraved.",0
6092,Happy that Almost all new released movies i find using boxxy software!,1
6093,"Like many Euro westerns from the 60s, Let the Corpses Tan is a psychedelic western that feels like an acid-induced rollercoaster ride into psychosis, where  the bizarre, the weird and the strange are the norm. Using pagan symbolism and nods to goddess worship, directors Bruno Forzani, Hélène Cattet take the audience into the lair of a cult style gang hideout where blood and mayhem lurk around every corner.",1
6094,"This has been categorised as a part comedy film but I wouldn't say its a comedy - certainly not in the traditional sense anyway, its more of a very dark comedy. Its a sombre and thought provoking watch and I enjoyed seeing the various cartoons come to life on screen. Seeing how John came to be in and adapted to his position, how he lets out (some of) his frustration by way of drawing cartoons, it is (certainly somewhat) inspirational. I particularly enjoyed seeing him ride about on his wheelchair at speed, to his hearts content - there is very much a rebellious aspect of John Callaghan's personality which comes across well. 

I thought Joaquin Phoenix was a good choice of actor to play the main role, as he is known for playing quirky, rebellious characters and this one I thought suited him well. It won't appeal to everyone but it is a decent, if quirky, at times sobering and at others amusing, watch. I suppose ultimately its about self expression, independence and identity. I think fans of Joaquin Phoenix will enjoy seeing him play a distinctly different character, the wheelchair bound artist John Callaghan.

I would recommend this to others, yes.",1
6095,Ok flick.  Didn't love it didn't hate it.  Main character somewhat unlikable and his girlfriend somewhat hard to believe.,0
6096,"It was an interesting story but it goes on too long. But I really am only writing the review to rave about Jonah Hill's amazing performance. It manages to be understated but engaging, unsentimental but warm and charming. Honestly a revelation.",0
6097,"El film está bueno, toca temas muy importante y lo más importante que da un muy buen mensaje, la actuación de Joaquín fénix es increíble  obviamente no esperaba menos, está película si la recomienda que la vean",1
6098,"The title is a caption of a drawing by John Callahan and based on his memoirs ""Will the Real John Callahan Please Stand Up?: A Quasi Memoir"",  Gus Van Sant's biography of the quadriplegic cartoonist, notorious for depicting macabre subjects and physical disabilities, is tenderly told with beneficent directing and a soulful ensemble performance led by Joaquin Phoenix.",1
6099,Incredible depiction of alcoholism and sobriety.,1
6100,"Gus Van Sant is brilliant, again. In this emotional and powerful biopic recovery film, although it deals with a heavy subject, alcoholism, it has really funny moments, Gus Van Sant does an incredible job of showing what it's like to get sober, and to be a person in an alcoholics life. I would recommend, 9.65/10",1
6101,"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot was successful in authentically depicting life as a quadriplegic with alcoholism. At least to me, a person who lives with neither affliction. However, so much of the movie is skin deep at best - scenes that seem like they're supposed to hit really hard don't earn their intended emotional response. The story is more interesting than not, but ultimately feels like it's just happening rather than painting an experience. Jonah Hill and Joaquin Phoenix are great though.",0
6102,"Great movie,  great performances.... Worth watching!",1
6103,It's a true story and the film narrates in a fascinating way. Could not leave it.,1
6104,"An impressive, emotional performance by Gemma Arterton. In my opinion, she carries the movie and makes Dominic Cooper seem comparatively wooden.",1
6105,I wish the ending was clearer.,0
6106,"This movie was pleasing to the eye to watch. The cinematography was nice, and Gemma is a beautiful woman. However, the movie itself was garbage. It starts with multiple sex scenes where her husband wants and has sex with her and all the while she looks like she's enduring a root canal. While in the missionary position, she pays her husband no mind, and seems incredibly interested in the condition of the ceiling. She avoids touching her husband with her hands, and cries somewhat furtively during the act. This happens like three times in a row (we got it the first time, guys). On each occasion, upon the conclusion of the act, she turns her back to her husband and buries her head in her pillow, weeping a few more tears. Ok,  she's not into him. We get it. The problem is they casted the role of the husband horribly, and the script does the film no favors. The man is young, handsome, and has the body of a professional soccer player. Making matters worse, he speaks to her nicely and is a communicator. When he sees her crying, he addresses the situation kindly, asking her what's wrong, and says several times that he just wants her to be happy. When she has her first crisis moment, wanting to take an art class, he actually says he understands and that it would be fine. A real monster, this guy, huh? At worst, he's a husband that's unaware of his wife's inner feelings. That's pretty much Every Man Ever. Of course, she NEVER TELLS HIM how she's feeling. All these scenes she just lays there stone-faced, shedding her tepid tears and repeatedly burying her head into the pillow. This goes on for half the movie. It's absurd. Nearly an hour in we're like ""where's her problem with this marriage?"" 

Worth mentioning that along with the male model husband, she has a beautiful house, 2 lovely, attractive children, and 2 nice cars to drive. Yeah, she's pretty much living the dream, especially in the UK where these things are quite expensive and many people don't have them so conveniently at their disposal. Perhaps they should have had her life actually suck a little bit? Maybe had the husband act abhorrently at the beginning of the film? At least then we'd sort of believe the whole Distraught, Lonely Wife Who Feels Trapped in the Prison that is Her Horrific Life thing. Instead the film gives us a woman with a handsome, fit husband, who's interested in his wife sexually, and willing to communicate with her. She's literally married to a unicorn, with a good life surrounding her, but we're supposed to believe she's miserable. Makes perfect sense.

I suppose this paradox makes the film ""deep"".  Ok. Whatever.

But wait, it gets worse. Later on in the film she's then tending to her children during the day, and during a moment of their childish behavior, crying and such, she proceeds to GO OFF on them. She essentially tells them that they suck, and screams at them to fuck off. Nice. Any ounce of empathy we might have had for this character at this point has now been completely eviscerated. 

Suddenly, it's as if the writers realize that they need to pull this movie out of its horrific nosedive of absurdity. We finally get a moment of the husband being a jerk. She spills a glass of juice on the breakfast table and hubby proceeds to call her a cow and tells the kids that ""mommy is stupid"" for spilling the glass. It is here that the title of the movie finally materializes. She runs upstairs to grab a bag of clothes and her ID, runs outside, jumps in one of their two cars, and drives off. Yup, she just bails... leaving her two kids behind. Mother of the Year material right here! Anyway, she flees to Paris and, get this, meets a man that day at an art museum and of course, has sex with him that same day! He told her he was single, and didn't have any kids. She TELLS HIM THE SAME THING about herself! It's moments later that they're having sex. Right after their act concludes, the dude's wife calls on his cell phone. Busted. He confesses to our leading lady that actually he isn't single, that he's married with kids. She immediately gets angry and hurt, telling him she never wants to see him again. Of course, this is the woman that fails to  mention her OWN FAMILY that's back in London. You can't make this stuff up. With that, she feels guilty and slinks back home, where she immediately resumes the miserable expressions on her face. Fade to black.  

Complete garbage. If we were supposed to feel sorry for her, or empathize with some sort of depressive state, this movie totally failed to accomplish that.",0
6107,"Bored unhappy housewife at the beginning and at the end, no transformation, just a sad person. Very depressing.",0
6108,"This is a powerful even riveting film.  I couldn't take my eyes off Gemma Arterton as Tara; she is more than pretty: she is stunningly beautiful in an understated way (so unlike her photograph on this site).  I am always with her emotionally, always attuned to every move of her eyes and mouth.  The film, with a wonderfully appropriate piano background, is understated throughout, especially the final scene that echoes the opening, suggesting that Tara's escape to Paris is only a temporary respite from her ordinary life as a wife and mother.",1
6109,Slow and boring story. Really not worth watching.,0
6110,"a woman basically sleepwalking through her marriage and two children, wakes up to the deep well of sadness within her. many will recognize this lost feeling. superbly portrayed by Gemma Arterton ",1
6111,"This was just plain awful. Tara was obviously depressed and needed counseling for herself and with her husband. You could tell she still loved her husband and children she was just lost. The description of this movie describes a bold woman who made a good choice to leave her family and ""find herself"". She wasn't bold she was a coward and selfish instead of getting help, working on things and staying with her poor baby's who freaked out when she left, she abandoned them. In the end it still shows her still emotionally messed up and misses her baby's. It isn't okay to give up and leave your family, it isn't bold, brave or the right way to find yourself and become happy again. They painted a positive picture on this movie but in reality what happened in the end wasn't okay. This movie about a depressed woman spiralling out of control, leaving her family and staying depressed in the end... made me depressed. Terrible movie. Just awful. ",0
6112,"A great performance by Gemma Arterton, beautifully capturing the emotions, detached hopelessness and loneliness we as mothers can face. I can really relate to this film.",1
6113,"Wake me when itâ(TM)s over  
 Fifty six minutes: twenty seven seconds.  This is how long I struggled along with this movie, begging for some reason to continue my time investment.  The Escape  had, by  now, become punishing  to watch.   The story succeeds in presenting the wife/mother as superb in all respects.  Clenching my teeth, I knew she would flee at some point.  Escape.
   She may have.  I will never know.  Much less where she went.  At 56:27, I ran out of gas.
   I wrote for the stage for a while and know how to put it together.  If something doesnâ(TM)t move the plot along to keep the viewer/reader engaged, then re-write it or toss it.  Holding off on audience capture until the last few minutes doesnâ(TM)t work.  The capture point in this movie never arrived for me.  I had other important things to take care of.  Equally bad grades for several other factors critical to a successful production.  Poor titling.  Horrible camera work.  Sketchy flow.  Too many unrealistic â~doing itâ(TM) scenes.  Pathetic lines.  After the eighteenth dis-satisfying close-up of her as her husband wrapped his arms around her, I found myself yawning.  Save your money.",0
6114,"Great movie. Funny scenes,Great Music! Overall a must see at least once or make it a holiday tradition like it is for me.",1
6115,"Based on the whacky descriptions, i thought this movie waa going to be at least interesting.  There was nothing i enjoyed about it.  Disjointed scenes, poor editing, undeveloped characters, silly scenes, bad songs, poor writing.  I did not watch the last 15 min, i just couldnt.",0
6116,Likeable characters and a super catchy soundtrack makes this a horror Christmas classic!,1
6117,"Anna and the Apocalypse is a genuine must see for anyone wating something a little less generic, it is a roller coaster of emotions and simultaneously pulls off quite a dark film with plenty of comedy - I highly recommend. Before I continue I think it is only fair if I establish that it is my favourite film (not just Christmas film), and I abuse the right to watch it in December. The film is not for everyone - namely those who do not enjoy musical films, as the songs are prominent {very enjoyable though}. However, everyone I have shown it too (20+ people) have thoroughly enjoyed it. It always bemuses people that the film is a Comedy/Zombie Horror/Musical/Christmas film, and surprises them to see it pull it all off flawlessly: with great acting - especially by 'Steph' (Sarah Swire), Ella Hunt (Anna), Paul Kaye (Savage), Ben Wiggins (Nick) and Malcom Cumming (John). These characters are (in my opinion) really well developed and believable, and I found myself not having any character I disliked - a rare feat for the majority of films. At a runtime of around 90 minutes, it manages to maintain the watchers attention until the end, be it with amusement or horror.
As it spans over many genres, it excels at all of them in different ways.
Horror/Comedy - The comedy is just downright hilarious at times, and allows for a good relief from the emotive action scenes, where characters you have built attachments to suffer. However, as the film progresses the humour is dulled down (still present), allowing for the dramatic parts of the film to really shine without being broken by a joke.
Zombie Film - the makeup for the zombies is really well done, and the zombies themselves are quite prominent (naturally). It is in many ways, a typical zombie horror - but with many other elements scattered in to make it a blast to watch.
Musical - the songs are well sung and thoroughly enjoyable, sticking in watcher's minds for days afterwards. It is a very 'musical-esque' film, and this element is often a detriment to some watchers: understandable, but even if you don't know what you're getting into it is still a good watch
I think the best way to conclude is with a comment the person who recommended it to me said - ""Don't look up much about it, just sit down and watch it: you will have no regrets at all""",1
6118,"I thought the movie was well done, the songs were very original and clever, and the acting was very good. Catchy songs and an adorable lead make for a great time, and now I can add another horror Christmas movie to my list.
Stupid me thought only Takashi Miike could blend musicals and horror. Glad I was wrong.",1
6119,"The family likes this movie quite a bit.  We watch it every holiday since it came out, and the songs are a big reason.  The actors are excellent, and the songs are very catchy and easy to sing.  The movie has some actual touching moments in it.  Worth a watch if you don't mind a bit of gore and like oddball musicals.",1
6120,"Película genial si las hay. La onda musical le dio un toque diferente que la hace destacar bastante. Buenos personajes, divertida, buenos chistes, buen ritmo y canciones pegadizas, tal vez a la historia le faltó un punch para ser perfecta.",1
6121,"This is an amusing watch - darkly comical, with a musical twist to it, a bit like a Shaun of the Dead type film. I enjoyed the musical numbers and the fast paced zombie related action. It was a little dull at one point but once the plot pace gets going, its quite fun. Its set at Christmas time and so can be categorised as an anti-Christmas film, a bit like 'Bad Santa' or 'Die Hard' - neither is it sentimentally cheesy (well, one or two of the songs are but I felt they were more of a parody of other musical type films) nor typical family friendly viewing. The special effects aren't too bad either. Yes, I'd recommend this film.",1
6122,This film was exactly as advertised and is now one of my holiday go-to movies. I recommend this to anyone that will hear me rave about it.,1
6123,"Another zombie flick but then again, if the overall quality is good, you don't really get tired of watching movies in this genre. It's an interesting blend of musical and zombies and while the general plot does seem familiar, there is enough in the story to keep you glued till the end.",1
6124,"On the backdrop of the potato famine that devastated Ireland and helped the english take more over, a Jack Reacher seeks revenge. Historical recreations makes us travel back in time and see how it really was.",1
6125,This was absolutely fantastic. Wish I'd known about it when it came out. Would love to have seen it in school too. Wonderful,1
6126,A very dark and gritty revenge movie.,1

6128,Fantastic Film highly recommended. Gives a good insight into a little known piece of Irish English history that preceded the great Irish migration to other parts of the world due to the Great Potato Famine in Ireland the lead actor has a stellar performance and as usual Hugo Weaving is a Powerhouse,1
6129,"The Irish version of Rob Roy.  Very dark and dreary, which wonderfully conveys the despair and downtrodden existence of the Irish peasant and the impact of the potato famine.  A lot is conveyed with icy looks and stares, perhaps too much.  There was a lot more that should have been said to create a greater depth in the characters, instead of that which was already conveyed with steely silence.  No outstanding performances, but a competent ensemble cast.",1
6130,"Dramatic portrayal of the Irish potato famine with a good story line.  Provides some  historical background of the Irish troubles to anyone who doesn't know it.  Film editing could have been better, but holds your interest throughout the movie.",1

6132,"Fantastic depiction of what was happening throughout ireland during the famine, british stealing land and charging rent to the inhabitants. Taking grain and crops from ireland to England while the irish starved, only feeding them when they renounced their language and faith.",1
6133,"Set in a horrible period in Ireland.  They took the potatoes from the Americas and it is an ideal food.  The famine broke out & it was a time when life meant crap.

6135,Realistic. Raw. This is what being a teenager in the 90s was like.,1
6136,"Wow, these kids can act! Felt more like watching real life than a movie. Completely engrossing. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy skating and/or have fond nostalgia for the 90s.",1
6137,"This is very much a nostalgic film depicting somewhat streetwise adolescents living in a teenage skater culture during the mentioned 1990s. It has, unsurprisingly, quite an indie (hence niche, perhaps) feel to it but I like that it does have a good amount of energy present (its quite edge right at the end, where a fisheye lens is used, giving it an even stronger 1990s feel...if not perhaps a bit of an 80s feel to it, as skateboarding was perhaps more a 1980s 'thing'?) and the main character is well portrayed by a young actor called Sunny Suljic. I respected his characters determination to be accepted by the group of slightly older teens. There's a lot of very strong language but not much violence and it probably mainly appeals to people who grew up in the 90s I'd imagine. I was roughly the same age as the adolescent boy (12 or 13) when the film was set (the mid 90s, of course), although I certainly didn't grow up in LA but I recognised/acknowledged certain aspects of the film. Also this film reminded me a little of another film focussing on Skater life for teens, a film called Skate Kitchen. 

I'd recommend this but only for people who look back at the 90s with a feel of nostalgia.",1

6142,"A nice and chill movie, and the movie portraits very much how it was for many people to be a teen in the mid 90`s",1
6143,"i've seen this movie 5 times now. have i gotten tired of it though? no way. Jonah Hill went from being a comedic actor to directing one of the most nostalgic movies i've ever watched. i wasn't alive in the ""mid 90s"" but somehow this movie made me feel as if i was. everything seemed so real, almost like i had experienced it for myself. the movie is melancholic, yet exciting and entertaining. stevie wants to escape his abusive brother and absent mother and finds refuge in a few older skaters. to me personally, this sounds like a dream, something i would pay to experience. my whole life i've been fascinated with skateboarding and the community that surrounds it, so when i heard this movie was coming out i KNEW i had to go see it. stevie begins to make poor choices, turning completely from his family and relying solely on his newfound friends. between a feud with reuben, a mother who will never understand, and a friend who seems to have nothing but good life advice, stevie does not know where he stands. alcohol abuse, his first sexual experience, and drug use; stevie is not the same kid we knew at the beginning of the movie. but he's happy, and that's all anyone needs. the movie ends happily, but with a twinge of disappointment and remorse... should it have ended with the car crash and the hospital scene? or should we have gotten to see more about what happens with dabney after she seems to accept the fact that these teenage skater boys are her sons friends? regardless, i loved it. 


sorry for going on such a long tangent!!


sadly, i have not seen it on the big screen yet :( i wonder if the experience would be different... 
this movie single handedly makes me feel something when i can't feel anything else. i have recommended this to multiple friends, and all of them love it. 
recommended for 5/5 people 😁",1

6146,Heart breaking movie  and  brilliant acting   by the  lead  roll what amazing actor,1
6147,"This is a quite sombre, touching film which reminded me a little of Slumdog Millionaire, only without the music. It'd take a hard person not to feel sorry for the main character, Zain. It's frustrating and thought-provoking, with a particularly poignant ending I felt. I would recommend this film, as long as you know that its quite gritty and dark in tone - a good piece of social commentary I suppose.",1
6148,"Capernaum is my favorite movie. Zain naturally brings you into his world and share everything with the viewers. Nadine Labaki is a sensitive soul and focus in an important message. I cried so much, but I learned. This movie is a life changing movie.",1
6149,The move for last 5 years.,1
6150,É um filme que vai te fazer refletir por vários dias.,1
6151,"Misery porn doesn't automatically make for good drama, and Capernaum is proof positive of that sentiment; the film often features excellent cinematography and an exceptionally good performance from child actor Zain Al Rafeea (as protagonist Zain), but is a mix of sincere, simple conflicts and laughably heavy-handed and unrealistic melodrama. Perhaps the best representation of this is a framing device where Zain literally takes his parents to court in an attempt to prevent them from having kids, where all the attendees are dumbfounded by the supposedly profound nature of his statements as if Frank Capra was brought on to tack on an ending to this screenplay. The events of the film are tragic, yes, but there isn't much in the way of context or theme to them, everything is just to provide another layer of struggle for our poor protagonist to contend with. Except juvenile prison, weirdly enough. It's sort of glossed over (like a lot in this film that probably should have been explored more), but once there Zain sort of gets taken in by an Artful Dodger-esque crowd without any sort of fanfare. It's Al Rafeea that really saves a lot of this film, delivering actual sincerity where Capernaum could have easily slid into being a very nicely framed arthouse melodrama alone. (2.5/5)",0

6153,"This movie is truly a masterpiece. I have never been moved by or enjoyed a movie more. It is heartbreaking and painful, but also incredibly beautiful. This young boy lives in a world full of pain and suffering, but through it all he remains a loving and good person. I think this movie is a perfect example of how the life we're brought up in can shape us, but does not have to define us. I would absolutely recommend this movie and have actually purchased it so I can watch it again.",1
6154,"""Dark River"" is an entirely humorless film. If you're in an entirely humorless mood, you might appreciate it. It also features a large cast of sheep who don't appear very happy.

In rural England, Alice (Ruth Wilson) is a sheep shearer who receives news that her father has passed and has left her the tenancy of the sheep farm where she grew up. She returns there and encounters her estranged brother Joe (Mark Stanley), who has let the place run down badly. The place needs a ton of work. Thinking that she is now the tenancy holder, she tries to get the place in shape, hoping that she and Joe can work it together. But Joe is obstinate about doing things his own way, and he doesn't want her help. After all, she has been gone for years and didn't even attend her father's funeral. Alice and Joe's relationship is tempestuous, sometimes to the point of violence.

Why the family conflict? We learn in short flashbacks that Alice was sexually abused by her father (Sean Bean). Alice keeps having visions of her traumatic past, which raises the question: Why does she return to this place? Catharsis? The question is not answered.

Another question is, did Joe know about the abuse? The answer is eventually revealed over an hour into the film.

Joe is awarded tenancy, we guess because he stayed on the farm all of those years and the landowner probably favored him over Alice. This, of course, ramps up the resentment. But the real reason Joe gets tenancy is that he has agreed to sell the land to developers.

This is pretty much a plotless movie. Its attributes include gorgeous shots of the British countryside and committed performances from Wilson and Stanley.
But the angst is overwhelming. There are many scenes that are pregnant with silence and discomfort. Seventy minutes in, I was wondering where it was all going to go. Surely, I thought, there must be a plot twist coming, or a narrative turn of some kind.

It comes in the final act. I found it pretty hard to swallow. But this movie is not about logic or normalcy. It's pure, hand-wringing melodrama, the kind that film festival judges love.",0
6155,"It's a rural, personal and slowly intense little indie with some exceptional acting from Ruth Wilson.",0
6156,The dramatic story follows a line of lack of understanding by lack of communication and lack of intelligence. All members of the family seems to lack intelligence until someone died.,0
6157,Wilson shines in this bleak(and that is being kind)drama.,1
6158,"This movie made a rare, understated, yet powerful statement about the impact of paternal sexual abuse on not just the victim, but her sibling and their relationship.  The psychological, social-political, economic, and even environmental issues raised were both literally and symbolically conveyed, making a deeply intelligent and even original statement about a painfully complex topic.",1
6159,"I thought this film was excellent.  Ruth Wilson, what can I say.  She gave a performance so raw and explosive under the surface of a young woman trying to find her way after a brutal chaotic childhood.  The beauty of the landscape hides a life full of trauma.  Wow, just wow.",1
6160,It was a good film all the way through until 15 minutes at the end when the screenwriter either had smoked a joint or ran out of creative ideas. A lot of potentially good films are spoiled because the writer runs out of proper ideas and the ending finalises with an unsasfactory ending such as this. It's a great shame.,0
6161,Pointless waste of time. Dialogue is difficult to understand. The storyline is predictable and boring. ,0
6162,"Alice played superbly by Ruth Wilson returns to the farm she left 15 years ago to escape the abusive attentions of her father.  Her father having died in her absence,  has left her the farm holdings in his will, much to the resentment of her brother who cared for both their father in his dying days and the farm in her absence.  So begins an unbearably tense film as tension and resentment grows between the siblings as they fight for control of the farm, eventually leading to a tragic ending.
It's a bleak film but worth the pay off with outstanding performances from the cast.  Not one you call enjoyable but certainly memorable for some time after viewing.",1
6163,"A movie with obvious talent but a lot of unfulfilled potential, Dark River looked great, and reminded me how beautiful and unique the English countryside is, but the story never comes close to being satisfying or involving. We've seen siblings fighting in movies before, but rarely has it felt so weightless and lethargic. Segments of dialogue are unintelligible due to them being muttered in heavy accents, and the words you can hear just aren't very interesting. It's the kind of film where characters rarely say what they're feeling, but the director is unable to effectively convey their inner torment. The flashbacks, which are supposed to illuminate the past, quickly become irritating, and one simple conversation could have covered all of them sufficiently. It jumps around erratically, never keeping focus or allowing us to digest what is happening. It could have been great, a family drama focusing on an intense rivalry between 2 estranged siblings fighting for the last thing they have. Instead it feels more like 2 grumpy children bickering over their favourite toy. There was a lot it could have done, and a lot it could have said, but it chose to do very little, and say even less.",0
6164,"Better than Harry Potter because real, relatable, uplifting.",1
6165,"Basically like Bridge to Terabithia, right down to the misleading marketing campaign. Just like that film, I Kill Giants is a drama dealing with themes of loneliness, bullying and grief but the advertising gave off the impression that it was a fantasy film when the fantasy aspects are implied to be in the girl's head although this film takes a more neutral stance unlike Terabithia making it clear from the get-go that this is part of their imagination. Just Here for Godzilla isn't even an effective excuse since in both films the fantasy stuff barely takes up 20 minutes of the runtime and otherwise deal with the protagonist's issues at home and at school. I Kill Giants is a decent drama but nothing worth raving about on the same level as the similarly somber Where the Wild Things Are. I honestly figured out that something smelled fishy when it seemed that the fantasy aspects were woefully underplayed and immediately realised when I saw the film that the ""From the producers of Harry Potter"" bit from the advertising was misaimed and solely because Chris Columbus and his production company were involved in the first three films. The acting's good, the photography in this movie looks gorgeous, I do like the girl slowly becoming friends with the new girl from England and the third-act plot twist was handled tactfully but the CGI was underwhelming, the protagonist's hostility could come off as uncalled for, there's a brother character who could easily be taken out of the story without changing anything and the big climactic showdown lasts for a pathetically short time. I Kill Giants is still compelling in its own way, especially once you realise why the girl is being a jerk to everybody but be warned, this movie has a fairly melancholy feel to it that will catch you off-guard if you were expecting a big fantasy action flick. I am not exaggerating with the Bridge to Terabithia comparisons and I know I'm not alone on this.",1
6166,"Powerful film that moves and entertains from start to finish. In general the film is very good and thrills in many points, even if at times it doesn't work too well due to some unhappy choices of interpersonal dynamics between students, but otherwise the film is very good. In conclusion, the film is his moral, everything centers on his moral in a wonderful way and that takes you straight to the heart without sparing anything and that leaves you with a wonderful feeling of melancholy and bitterness.",1

It was kind of hard to watch, but only because, as my daughter said while watching it, it’s so “cringey”. I know what the movie meant to do and the message it tries to convey but when it’s just said in words there’s less meaning behind it. Filmmaking means you have to express the intention using a visual medium and rely less on dialog and words. This is where I Kill Giants faltered. I instantly compared this to A Monster Calls, which was a movie that was able to convey a message effectively and did it without cringe. ",0

Maybe it's a familiar story to elvis fans, but for one who's not, like me, it was a wonderful metaphor for how a talented person (usa) filled with trust and naivite (USA) can be taken advantage of by con artists and blame-shifters (usa), and decline into self-destruction due to innocent greed (USA).

Whoever they had playing Mary poppins did a decent portrayal… she really did capture the essence in a lot of ways; however with better direction maybe that could have been done a little more or a little better. 

They tried really hard to mirror a lot of things, which could be a good thing if the music popped more… but without the music, it's a little hollow.",0

6190,"This is a jolly, fun, colourful and of course family friendly sequel to the original 1960s Mary Poppins film. It features (like the original film) a mix of animation and live action scenes and various irritatingly catchy tunes (you've been warned, parents). Its certainly an entertaining watch...not by any means a particularly stand-out, amazingly memorable film, this is a solid piece of good family entertainment, which I imagine pretty much all fans of the original film will enjoy, certainly in parts, if not in full. Of course its also very much sentimental and unsurprisingly cheesy (but of course!), with some pretty predictable plot aspects but I suppose that's pretty much to be expected. As Disney films like this go, its well worth a watch if your interested I reckon, so yes, I'd recommend it, although I wouldn't necessarily say its the best of recent Disney films, its by no means bad either. (also, finally, I couldn't quite figure out (certainly on first watching) what the symbolism was of the sailor and the boat.",1
6191,"Horrible. To live up to the original, a Mary poppins sequel must have a tremendous soundtrack. The music in this movie is forgettable at best, and annoying at worst.

However, it's among one of all time favorites of the genre.",1
6206,"This is not a fun film. It is nasty throughout. The production value is very high, it looks and sounds great. Letting it down is the concept, the bad writing and the boring arrogant directing. There was one shot where the camera spins around that must have been done on a technocrane which shows that they spent lots of money on it but it really takes away from the scene, they actually made that moment worse by using a distracting camera move purely for the sake of it. It really bothered me, if you use these cool bits of equipment then have a reason. Anyway the acting and casting are excellent. The genre is hugely inconsistent, it's mostly a thriller but sometimes it veers heavily into either horror, torture porn and supernatural. The supernatural elements are never addressed or resolved, in a frustratingly similar way that May (2002) dealt with these elements. The ending would have been good if the build up had led to it but it didn't. I also had a hard time believing that anyone would stay on the island and accept it as a way of life, especially if that had come from somewhere rather than being born into that life. They are complicit in the torture, unfazed, almost enjoying it. The graphic torture porn scenes didn't add anything to the film. They spend a long time setting up some characters and stories but sometimes they introduce a character only to kill them off in the same scene without any real engagement. Hugely disappointing waste of budget and talented cast and crew.",0

The story is interesting from an American point of view because we've dealt with multiculturalism since our inception. Watching how these other countries (who have low birth rates, and were 99% homogeneous until 30 years ago) deal with the complexities of potentially losing some of those culture comforts homogeny provides is a fascinating story because there is no simple solution. It takes real tolerance, patience and understanding. The events surrounding July 22 are overwhelmingly tragic and sad and the movie does try to showcase the Labor Party as the winners in the end. However, I was stunned by how much of Anders Rhetoric they allowed into the film. I'm sure that's gotta be tough for a lot of people to watch.",0

Até a metade do filme é um drama, mostrando o sofrimento de uma mãe e sua família em ter um filho drogado, que já foi internado varias vezes. E se o filme continua-se nesta visão, o filme seria muito melhor. Pois a atuações de Julia Roberts, de sua filha Kathryn foi muito boa. E claro Lucas. Que desde igreja, a grupo de ajuda, velhos amigos e a próprio pré-conceito da família, principalmente do padastro e sua própria irmã. E sua mãe que parece um pitbul que não solta de seu filho em único momento. Mas depois do meio para o final o filme se transforma em uma perseguição da mãe ao filho que para recuperar o seu cachorro, vai encontrar com antigos amigos. E se torna uma perseguição.

Are we supposed to believe that in the year 2018, this stalker can get away with so much and have no cameras capture what he's done at the hospital? And if you want to argue that cameras aren't legal at the hospital... Okay, then what about the mom character the stalker murdered at the hotel? Are there no cameras at the hotel, either? Assuming that, at some point, her body was found by a hotel employee, wouldn't they have called the police and checked the surveillance of everyone who went in and out of this place? They would have seen this guy on camera going in and out of the hotel? Yet, this storyline wasn't even addressed again. What was the point for the Raul Castillo character? An actor of such high caliber agreeing to be a part of this, just so that he could say that he worked with Steven Soderbergh? What was his challenge as an actor in portraying his role? What was his arc? Why would anyone in the audience care and invest for him? Raul's character was so flatly built. This whole film is pathetic and poor. This is a total POFS. Yet, someone in ""hollow""-wood thought it was important to give this dude money to create this poor excuse of a film. I was begging for this film to come to an end.

I would recommend this film, yes.",1
6247,"For over three decades, Steven Soderbergh has been making films that ranged from obscure, artsy fare to Oscar-winning  blockbusters. In ""Unsane,"" he delves into low budget, B-movie territory, but his effort deserves an A.

Shot on an iPhone with a blocky, 1.56:1 ratio, the entire film has a confining feel and a grainy, disorienting look. That's appropriate, because the story involves a young lady who is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Sawyer (Claire Foy) is fleeing from a stalker. She has moved from Boston to Pennsylvania, but she still has fears and nightmares. Seeking counseling at a ""behavioral center,"" she suddenly finds herself being checked in against her will. To make matters worse, one of the orderlies (Joshua Leonard) looks exactly like her stalker, but she can't convince anybody of his guilt. When she first meets him, she instinctively hits him—which, of course, just prompts the doctors to put her on more psychotropic medication.

Sawyer gets one phone call upon her admittance. She calls the cops, who don't bother to do anything. After all, how many mental patients insist that they are being held against their will? Later, she borrows a prohibited cell phone and contacts her mother (Amy Irvng), who is unable to claw her way through all of the bureaucratic and legal red tape. And without getting into spoilers, things don't work out so well for her, either.

We are forced to question Sawyer's sanity throughout the film, until a climactic scene finally reveals the truth.

The  whole affair invokes 1970's films ranging from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" to exploitation pics like ""Human Experiments."" But although ""Unsane"" may be a tad derivative, it works extremely well. Foy's Sawyer is sassy, demanding, unpredictable, and sympathetic all at the same time. Leonard's character is suspicious, but the script makes us wonder if we, like Sawyer, are just being paranoid.

Jay Pharoah and Juno Temple turn in strong supporting performances as fellow patients (or inmates, depending on your viewpoint).

Kafkaesque and suspenseful, ""Unsane"" proves that a great filmmaker doesn't need a multimillion dollar budget to create something memorable. 

On a related note, why do filmmakers use iPhones? The Google Pixel has a better camera. Just saying...........",1

6268,"The Party (2017), written and directed by Sally Potter, is a dark delicious steaming comedy where celebration meets existential angst and misery.

It's the story of Janet's party.  Janet hosts an intimate group of friends to celebrate a milestone event which quickly unravels and all hell breaks loose.
Potter weaves together many visual elements to create an intriguing film.  Potter juxtaposes the narrative of the party against the simmering tensions amongst the characters and their revelations to create dramatic tension that moves the film.  Close ups and medium angle shots are interspersed with wide angle shots.   The film is beautifully shot in black and white, giving the film a richness and complexity, which helps to focus your attention on the superb acting and dialogue and the content of the film without the distraction of color.   The characters are beautifully lit, and Patricia Clarkson never looked more gorgeous, sensuous, and beautiful.  And Potter has chosen to end her film in a cliffhanger leaving me wanting more and hoping that a sequel is in the works.

It is a marvelous film made up of a stellar cast where each of the seven characters is allowed to shine and play complex scenes.    Kristin Scott Thomas plays Janet, the middle-aged hostess, a plain ""Jane"", who is a member of parliament.   Timothy Spall plays her philandering academic husband Bill.  Cherry Jones plays Martha, an academic and Bill's long-time friend.  Emily Mortimer plays Jinny, Martha's spouse.   Martha and Ginny are expecting triplets.   Patricia Clarkson plays April, Janet's glamorous best friend with a loose tongue.  Bruno Ganz plays April's spouse, Gottfried, a life coach, aromatherapist and healer.  Cillian Murphy plays Tom, a successful businessman, whose wife Marianne is Bill's former student, and Janet's colleague. 

The film resonated with me on a personal level posing important existential questions such as the transitory nature of life, the meaning of life, the impermanence of life, realism, faith, and karma.  I thought The Party one of the best philosophical movies I have ever seen and highly recommend it for the superb acting and dialogue.",1
6269,"A gem. Brilliant cast. There's a bit near the end where it seems to slog briefly, but it's a great lead  to the ending.",1
6270,Honestly not bad 2.6,0
6271,"Spoilers: What a hoot! Pretentiousness reigns, even with the ""artsy"" black and white, as overstatement rules, Emily not just pregnant but with triplets; Cillian not just a blow user, but uses a lot, and his angst at fever pitch, too; Mary Ann, whom we never see, is sleeping with about everyone; Patricia beyond acerbic of mouth but so condescendingly insulting, you wonder how she is not punched. Kristin overwrought that near-death hubby Spall is sleeping with Mary Ann, when she is, too. Bruno so unctiously considerate, you just want him to shut up; Cherry so fearful the life with Emily will end that she blows it up. So everything takes it on the chin -- academics, a financier, a high-ranking Brit government minister, medical science, pregnant ladies, and the proclivity for violence among even the smart people. Everyone played this to the hilt, and I laughed out loud a lot at the prevalent inappropriate comments, done for darkly comedic, satiric laughs. All the right notes, gang. Bravo, bravo, bravo, bravo, etc,",1
6272,"Overall, The Party is a quick, fun and exciting film. Its strongest point is the characters and the actors as they all interact with each other. The film does build up to a ""twist"" which I found was somewhat predictable. Nevertheless, it's still entertaining and creative - Walkden Entertainment",0
6273,This movie is SO different. Everyone's acting was just excellent and the way the plot unfolded was very enjoyable. I do admit some of the characters definitely had some points where I don't think the dramatic effect of the film was needed .

6286,"World's Greatest Mysteries: Where Jimmy Hoffa's body is, the identity of Jack the Ripper, and how Pierce Brosnan managed to get more singing lines after the first Mamma Mia! movie. 

With less of a focus on recruiting recognizable acting talent and shoehorning in the next ABBA song, Here We Go Again has much more room to be a competent film than the original musical adaptation of a decade prior. Though the film is split between flashbacks and sequel scenes, and can only be understood in the context of the first film, it's a much tighter narrative overall despite still largely sticking to existing ABBA tracks (and having fewer of the highlights to pick from) and having the creativity to give the script some fun elements like putting Stellan Skarsgård in a fatsuit to play his unknown identical twin brother. As a result of having fewer jukebox hits, this sequel is less of a nostalgia-inducing greatest hits compilation but it delivers a better (if unnecessary) story, and is helped out by being more selective when picking vocalists. Yeah, a lot of the conflicts and subplots have to be manufactured, but Here We Go Again delivers on all of the joyous promise of the original film with a better structure, even if Meryl Streep is missed and the Cher cameo is whatever (I was more excited when the Dos Equis guy showed up at the end). 

There is a comic relief security guard that calls Skarsgård old and straight-up eye fucks Colin Firth, it's fantastic. And then they do the Titanic pose on the front of a yacht? Honestly I want a comedy just starring those two. (3/5)",0

6289,Well....good things happen when you actually try with your movie compared to its lazy uninspired predecessor. The acting this time is decent enough and the plot actually has some degree of substance. The editing and pacing is decent also but nothing phenomenal. The songs are actually sung good overall but the dancing is still nothing special. Overall this is a Good musical but not a classic by any stretch. If you like musicals than see this.,1
6290,"This is another rather cheesy and and light watch perhaps but its also a fun and amusing watch, much like the original 'Mamma Mia!' film, only (sadly) without quite so much of Meryl Streep present on screen. I was pleased to see Hugh Skinner present (he played the somewhat air headed BBC temp in the TV series 'W1A'). There are plenty of big names present in the cast, aside from Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Amanda Seyfried, such as Cher, Omid Djalili, Celia Imrie and Andy Garcia. I also noticed Tom Hanks in the credits as an associate producer.

I liked how vivid the colours were - the film features some lovely landscape shots of the Greek surroundings. There is, of course (it goes without saying) plenty in the way of enjoyable choreography. I admit I found myself humming along to most of the songs, although I suppose some of the songs weren't as familiar to me but I guess thats inevitable, given the main, popular ABBA songs will surely have already featured in the original film (some are in this film as well but not all). Its a bit more understated at times than the original, I suppose. As follow ups/sequels go, its certainly not bad. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is better than the original but if you enjoyed it then you'd likely enjoy this as well and so I'd recommend it regardless.",1
6291,"Fromage.  Queso.  Formaggio.  Cheese.   No matter what language or culture, cheese is a comfort food that is immensely enjoyable, but too much of it can become difficult to digest.  Cheese is best served in small portions.  Mama Mia Here We Go Again (2018) is simply a cheese-tastic morsel!
This movie is two stories in one and pure escapism.   It picks up 10 years after the original Mama Mia, while also going back in time to provide more detail about Donna Sheridan (played in the original film by Meryl Streep, but in these flashback sequences by Lily James).  In the present, Donna's daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is opening up the hotel Donna always wanted to open.  In the past sequences, we learn how Donna ended up in Greece and how she met each of the three men that may be Sophie's father.
The original film is based on the juke box musical that incorporates the hits of the 1970's popular Swedish band, ABBA.  This sequel incorporates more songs from ABBA's rich catalogue and builds the stories around them.  As the film opens, it seems that the main course might be cheese balls, but once the mood is set and the story unfolds it becomes an enjoyable gouda.  And the final scene in the hilltop church between Streep and Seyfried is a rich and elegant brie!   The film concludes like the original, with all the cast singing and taking bows… leaving you fulfilled and upbeat with the earworms of the ABBA buffet you just participated in.  
Pierce Brosnan still can't sing, bless his heart for trying, but fortunately in this sequel his attempt to do so is very quick.   This small moment of discomfort is cancelled out by the fact that the iconic Cher (as Donna's mother) gets to belt out two ABBA classics!  It's not quite as cohesive as the original, but the cast and songs still provide a nice cheesy little getaway.",1

The movie wastes no time jumping into what I guess you could call a ""second act"", so much so that it's almost a preface, and then the rest of the movie.

6306,"âWhatâ(TM)s going on today? Everything is fucked up.â?

Have a Nice Day is the second animated feature from Chinese director Jian Liu, following 2010â(TM)s Piercing I. The style of animation is captivating, expressive, and occasionally surreal: somewhere between Monkey Dust (2003) and Waking Life (2001).

Jian Liu injects his second feature with more humour than the first. He has a penchant for the heist-gone-wrong narrative, not a million miles from Welcome to Collinwood (2002). Although there is an abundance of violence, it is much more comedy than thriller.

At a running time of 103 minutes (Piercing I) and 75 minutes (Have a Nice Day), Jian Liuâ(TM)s animations prove his determination as a filmmaker. Largely a solo effort, they possess the magnetism of a young band perfecting their skills on the gig circuit, whilst maintaining the intoxicating raw energy of a creation still rough around the edges. A necessary counterpoint to big budget animations from powerhouse studios. Piercing I took 3 years to complete, whereas Have a Nice Day took closer to 5. The difference is unmistakable yet Jian Liu preserves his signature style.

Have a Nice Day has been compared to Pulp Fiction (1994), but Tarantino has never devoted so much screen time to examining the shabby and decaying urban landscape. Jian Liu seems to take as much of an interest in small-scale architecture as illustrators Chris Ware or Adrian Tomine. These scenes â"" almost stills but for a whisper of cigarette smoke or a buzzing neon sign â"" offer a great deal more subtlety and detail than is found in the rendering of the characters. One exquisite scene, a series of cuts showing buildings and alleyways in the rain, adopts clever use of sound â"" with the rainfall becoming richer or tinnier to match each setting.

The era of the story is important to the director, choosing to set each film in a very specific time-frame, highlighting it as pivotal to the plot. Each film is placed in time using global political markers, namely the 2008 global financial crisis and the election of Obama, in Piercing I, and the election of Trump referenced in Have a Nice Day.

Looking at the films in tandem, it is interesting to see the artistic development as well as Liuâ(TM)s confidence in his narrative becoming more robust.

Have a Nice Day premiered in the main competition for the Golden Bear at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2017.",1

Али Махершала играет доктора Дона Ширли, вундеркинда с множеством докторских степеней; он говорит на нескольких языках и играет  Шопена и Чайковского лучше, чем кто-либо другой; Для запланированного  концертного тура, в котором его трио, басист (Майк Хаттон) и виолончелист (Димитар Маринов), отправляется на Глубокий Юг, он просит об услугах водителя, который также будет телохранителем.
Тони Валлелонга (Вигго Мортенсен), уроженец Бронкса и вышибала из клуба. Тони также имеет укоренившиеся предубеждение об афроамериканцах, о чем свидетельствует сцена, когда его любящая жена Долорес (Линда Карделлини) предлагает двум чернокожим водопроводчикам стакан лимонада. Тони реагирует тем, что выбрасывает пустые стаканы в мусорное ведро, в ответ на это Долорес не высказывает недовольства, несмотря на спасение посуды для питья. Тем не менее, Тони соглашается на работу, учитывая высокую зарплату и обещание Ширли, что они вернутся к Рождеству.

Сценарий Ника Валлелонги, Брайана Карри и Фаррелли делает каждую реплику Тони убедительной, не важно, демонстрирует он свою узкую точку зрения, успешно обманывает кого-то или хвастается своей победой в конкурсе по поеданию хот-догов. Люди по соседству называют его болтун"", если использовать его слова, — способный убедить других делать то, чего они не хотят. Есть сцена, где Тони, пораженный тем, что Ширли никогда не пробовала KFC убеждает его попробовать — ""Но ваши люди любят жареную курицу"" — говорит он, убеждая эрудированного работодателя есть пальцами. Ширли, тем временем, пытается привить этичность, далекому от этикета водителю, что продемонстрировано в сцене, где Ширли противостоит Тони из-за кражи камня у придорожного торговца.

Упомянутая книга, основана на ""Зеленой книге негра-автомобилиста"" Виктора Гюго Грина, и на «Путеводителе по путешествиям», двух путеводителях, предназначенных для того, чтобы помочь чернокожим водителям найти гостеприимные рестораны, жилье у дороги и автомобильные услуги. Беспрепятственное передвижение по дорогам было романтической концепцией Америки, но это также было заблуждением, поскольку афроамериканцы, путешествующие на машине могли оказаться остановленными полицией или бандой расистов без причин, кроме цвета кожи. Простое право передвигаться без преследований, казалось бы, улучшенное за последние пятьдесят лет, остается под вопросом, учитывая количество полицейских перестрелок с участием афроамериканцев.",1

6319,"This film is an absolute Masterpiece that deserves all the Praises it's been getting,the chemistry between these two characters is truly outstanding and after I was done watching I felt every emotion there is, this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest film ever made and stands as a reminder of what a movie should be.",1
6320,"Greenbook is a very interesting and enjoyable film to watch about the real life story of a working class white Italian becoming friends with a highly musically talented Black man in 1960's America. It explores the racism and homophobia of the times in the North and Southern United States. 
However, I must say that it definitely didn't deserve to win best picture at the Oscars. This was a 3/4 star film and at best should've only been nominated. Movies similar such as Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile and Driving Miss Daisy were 4/4 star films and thus were better than Greenbook and deserved Best Picture. I think this film won for two reasons, 1. Their weren't that many other good films that came out the same year. And 2. The Oscars at times tend to pick films that are about something serious like racism, etc.",1
6321,"really touching, I love this movie so much",1
6322,"This is quite a well made period drama - it certainly looks like it had a decent budget. There's a good cast and it feels suitably atmospheric. Its a somewhat thoughtful film I suppose, given the story, a fairly well known story I suppose (a novel by Charles Dickens), though I wasn't familiar with it personally, other than by name. I'm not sure there's much I can say about it - I'm not too keen on David Walliams - I'm not exactly a fan of him normally and it felt a little 'off' to have him appear in such a period film but perhaps I'm a little unfair? judge for yourself and also it goes without saying that Helena Bonham Carter is very much suited to her role - I imagine she enjoyed playing Miss Haversham very much and she certainly looks the part, as the gothic, somewhat ghostly lady living in a dark and run down mansion/house of sorts. Yes, overall I would recommend this as a decent film of its type.",1

6325,"This movie was only interesting because of the way it weaved a fictional tale into the complex historical realities of post-war Beirut. That was the most compelling aspect of this film, and the storyline seemed secondary. John Hamm appears to be an alcoholic in every role he plays, so there is that too.",0
6326,A bit too long & complicated for me.  This had good acting & writing.,0
6327,A very good straight forward movie about a broken man who must return to the country that gave him his best and worst memories in life and must forgo all of that to save the life of his best friend in the volcanic political headache of Beirut.,1

It seemed like an episode from Homeland with no high speed chases or high flying bullets just smart excellent script with a good cast that also included Rosamund Pike, Mark Pellegrino and Dean Norris. It was so sad to see such a beautiful country torn to pieces. I am afraid I will never see my birthplace in my lifetime.  Overall it was a good captivating movie with a good cast.",0

I remember the massacre at Munich and the car bomb in the Marine barracks, the two events which bracket the action. This has all the best elements of a John Le Carre novel (and better than most adaptations of the same). Who's the enemy, who's the ally, what's the fight about.

6345,Brilliant movie and great acting.,1
6346,The most evocative and insightful movie on van Gogh I have seen.  Willem Dafoe is van Gogh incarnate.  One must simply sit in silence for a while after watching.,1
6347,"Willem Dafoe gives a performance so good that once in a while you forget that van Gogh was 25 years younger than him when he died. 

At Eternity's Gate is an interesting film, but it's mostly the vehicle for Dafoe to give yet another critically lauded leading man performance than it is to dive into the psyche of an infamously tortured artist. Long takes, uncomfortably close angles, and overlaid, repetitive dialogue routinely give a sense of van Gogh's mental instability, but in a surprisingly monotonous way and without much clarity as to the nature of his suffering. It's odd that the film doesn't take the leap into speculative thoughts that the artist might have had, choosing instead for often surface-level misunderstandings or somewhat hamfisted religious allegories, particularly when it plays relatively fast and loose with historical reality by indulging in the popular theory that van Gogh was accidentally shot and using the lost sketchbook as an indication of his lack of appreciation (when in reality, the authenticity of that sketchbook has been cast into serious doubt). Despite what you might call a strange choice of narrative direction, there's no doubt that Dafoe himself gives a particularly good performance here, with all the strange mannerisms and passion that you might expect, well deserving of the Academy nod. 

Visually on point but not very thematically daring, the film still gets by with a suite of well-known actors and one magnetic central performance. (3/5)",0
6348,"Personally, the plot is definitely someone who conceives a background of Van Gogh's life and this movie reinforces the basic knowledge about Van Gogh, the performances are very fluid and full of feelings that produce the ending, I like it but I feel that they could extend more",1
6349,"At Eternity's Gate takes care to show perspective and beauty. The film is calm, thoughtful, and serene, and so much more than a biography of an artist.",1
6350,"Simplemente increíble ver a Defoe como Van Gogh, sobre todo en sus últimos días tan atormentado, tan disperso, tan ido, en una búsqueda constante de la belleza en la cual sumergirse.",1
6351,An awesome performance by Willem Dafoe as Vincent Van Gogh and excellent music by Tatiana Lisovskaya.,1
6352,"It tells the sad story of the poor painter (Van Gogh) in the worst possible way, in my opinion. The acting is okay I would say",0
6353,"I think this movie is very successful in portraing this painter's reality in a very subjective way, bringing us deeply into his mind",1
6354,"4 Stars!!! A biographical drama film about the final years of famed but tormented Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, when he lived in Arles, France, painting masterworks of the natural world that surrounded him. Willem Dafoe delivers an impeccable performance as the painter, which earned him several nominations for Best Actor in 2019. The impressive and visually satisfying cinematography is also noteworthy, since it transports the viewer back to those times through the eyes of van Gogh, showing us how he saw things. Beautiful scenery, a great color palette, which of course, included yellow, and an unexpected and perhaps debatable twist at the ending.",1
6355,"This is a good escapist, feel good watch. I've read the book this film is adapted from, so I was aware of the story and the film didn't disappoint. I suppose some may feel it too 'fluffy' and perhaps even boring but I enjoyed it as a pleasant and unoffensive film to watch for a couple of hours. As I say, I have read the book but that was at least a year ago, so I had forgotten some of the more finer plot details and I enjoyed revisiting it via the film. I felt that Katherine Parkinson being present reminded me of her role in Doc Martin - its a bit like that, in terms of it protraying a close knit community of different people with their own quirks and so on. The main difference, I suppose, is that this film and the book is set with the backdrop of World War II. 

I feel comforted somehow by the way the community come together to get themselves through such a clearly tough and somewhat bleak time. There are definitely hardships conveyed but most of the film has a more gentle feel to it, although most of the characters are quite warm and likeable.

Overall I'd say this is a good watch, a bit slow for some perhaps with little action or exciting plot twists but in terms of a character focussed historical drama about a close knit community dealing with the aftermath of WWII, its by no means bad. I would recommend it, if it sounds of interest, yes.",0

6360,"Must see, great cast, lovely story",1
6361,"Aww this was cute and sweet.  Acting and costumes were good, although I thought often the dialogue was a bit... unnatural? Artificial?
Nothing epic in terms of a story, just something that seems perfectly ordinary that flows along, with random surprises that pop along. Its one of those films that you kinda know how it's going to end and yet still watch it to see how it happens.  You know, one of those feel good movies and they all lived happily ever after, the end ( but really, come on,  a girl spends  a week in some village and wants to marry a guy she met  a handful of times?)",1
6362,We made ink before we knew how to write on paper. Love is simply like that. The mystery that no science nor magic can ever succeed to explain or begin to comprehend. We find love when we do not search for it. This film beautifully reminded me of that incredibly annoying notion about love.,1

PD:you winned the full star for at least being stop-motion",0
6367,"If you've seen other Nick Park films then you'll know roughly what to expect - somewhat eccentric characters and a fairly quirky plot line delivered via stop motion animation, wich is very much family friendly viewing. This all applies to this film, so there's no change there. I didn't find it as amusing as the Wallace & Gromit films but then I suppose thats maybe a lot for this to live up to, not least as the characters are brand new (or really old, if you know what I mean - pardon the plot related pun).

Its an easy and enjoyable watch, with some pretty good examples of visual, slapstick comedy. I thought the voice acting was quite good but as I say it doesn't really compare to the studios previous works. I liked that the cave men were clearly portrayed as having their own flaws, which, no doubt, on a serious note, they would have had. I tend to enjoy the quirky/zaniness factor and the tongue-in-cheek sense that Nick Park films have and this film is no exception. I wouldn't say, however, that this is more memorable compared to other such films. However, I should point out that its very much football focussed, plot wise, so the football theme/references could get a bit boring if your not a fan of the sport, though it is pretty lighthearted and, suffice to say, not intended to be taken especially seriously (seriously, can you imagine cave people engaging on football matches?).

Overall this is a fun and amusing, family friendly watch which is worth a watch if your interested in the story, although it isn't better than the previous Aardman studios films.",0
6368,"Unfunny, unoriginal, and unromantic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
6369,"Uncharacteristically weak by Aardman's standards, Early Man, like most of the studio's filmography, boasts great stop-motion animation & sets, memorable character designs, solid voice acting and some good old-fashioned visual gags and slapstick humour but its unusually generic characters whose ""development"" amounts to...being really good at football like their ancestors, surprisingly cliched underdog sports story - note that the marketing, even on the UK's side, made no mention of the fact that it was about football; I didn't even realise until I learned what the movie was about that the title was meant to be a pun - and odd tendency to fall back on some more generic type of jokes make this film the iconic British studio's weakest film to date...albeit far from, to slightly paraphrase from Chicken Run, a load of silly, ruddy half-arsed tripe. The idea of an Aardman production being just okay when even their ""worst"" movies beforehand were ""just"" good is simply something we never really anticipated and hopefully, Aardman will learn from their mistakes and prevent them from happening again when that Chicken Run sequel comes out ln Netflix. They'd better have a bloody good reason to return to that stop-motion classic if they've waited this long to release Chicken Run 2.",0

6376,"I *WANTED* to like this. I really did. Michael Moore did some GREAT stuff with ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Fahrenheit 9/11""... 
I always appreciated his passion, and the effort he put into documenting the stupidity of the Bush Administration (which, while stupid, doesn't even COMPARE to the stupidity of the ""that-guy-from-Celebrity-Apprentice"" Administration).
Unfortunately, I was fascinated and disappointed to learn that Michael Moore is nearly as conspiracy-minded and ignorant of Nominative Procedure and Electoral Process as the average American-moron who attacked America on January 6th, 2021.
Moore falsely accuses the Democratic Party of stealing its own 2016 Presidential Nomination (which means, after decades of being ""involved,"" he apparently still hasn't ever bothered to learn how Caucuses and Primaries work, or how delegates are proportionally allocated at the district level.)
These are, and always have been, highly visible and publicized processes. 
You'd think he'd at least make some effort to understand or at least research those processes before getting on a pedestal and declaring them ""fake."" 
He does get a lot right (his initial breakdown of Trump's publicity-stunt candidacy is accurate) but then he himself does nothing but engage in stupid publicity stunts like trying to ""citizen's arrest"" the Governor of Michigan -- which honestly only feeds into the nutty idea that preposterous things are reasonable.
Moore's attempt at admonishing people who ignore or reject Facts and Law, while he himself consistently demonstrates a near-radical ignorance and disregard for Facts and Law, comes off as needlessly partisan and stupidly hypocritical. 
Much like Trump was America's worst and most dishonest Executive, this is Michael Moore's worst and most dishonest movie.",0
6377,"Moore's documentary is all over the map, zigzagging from Trump's election to fascism to the Flint water crisis to striking teachers in West Virginia. The election night footage triggers some serious PTSD and some of Moore's narration is way over the top, but it's still an engrossing film.",1
6378,LOL; the funniest R-rated documentary ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
6379,The only thing I regret more than sitting through this is not being able to give it zero stars.,0
6380,"Very self indulgent and egotistical. Also I don't like how things are hinted at, i.e the accusations that Trump wants to sleep with his daughter, very low and reptilian like. Really missed the mark with this one.",0
6381,"It's very good! 😀
I'd recommend it 👍🏼

Eye-opening",1
6382,"Another great film by Michael Moore addressing America's end times - it's political climate targeted at oppression of poor minorities. I disagree with other critics - I believe his comparisons to Adolf and the rise of despotism were powerful in connecting history to the present. This film made me laugh, cry many times, feel betrayed, learn, and also inspired me. I'm awaiting Moore's next film eagerly.",1
6383,"Might just be the high standard Moore has set in the past, but this movie was not as focused as I'd hoped- kinda felt like putting all the footage collected over the last 4+ years to use by trying to create a narrative/story that weaves it's way in all the material... didn't feel like it worked, as it felt a little more disjointed than his other strong docs.",0
6384,"Moore is a talented filmmaker, and in Fahrenheit 11/9 he brings his talents to shed light on our current situation.  Every couple of years he does a film that makes society look in the mirror to address the important issues of the day.  It's must viewing for us all who believe in democracy, he brings into focus what we need to be working on as a society, he's trying to wake us up to our responsibility if we wish to live in a democracy.

6395,"I'll give it 5 because I need to counter all the bad reviews by people who didn't get it. It's really more between a 3 and a 4, but for what it is it's a 5. Welles didn't have a lot of money to make it. What he did have was talent and time. Still it took him the last 15 years of his life, not counting the decade of pre-production and he still died with it unfinished.

It was mired in legal and technical difficulties and risked being added to his list of unfinished films. Fortunately the money was raised and the legal red tape cleared away. That left only the technical problems to overcome. Thanks to wells notes and a work print of a portion of the film as well as the increase of computer power over the intervening years it wasn't insurmountable. 

The miles of footage was digitized and cataloged and edited into a mostly coherent cut that approximates Welles' vision for the film. The documentary They'll Love Me When I'm Dead is as engaging as the final product, maybe more so, and makes a great companion piece to it. Welles himself said profetically, ""Supposing during the course of making the picture that it's more interesting hearing the actors and myself talk about it than making the picture. That will be the picture.""",1
6396,Probably not to everyone's taste. It's often an incoherent rambling affair. Viewed in the context of its much more interesting and more easily watchable documentary movie of the making of - they'll love me when I'm dead - it gives background to Orson Welles character and friendships and his relationship with the movie industry. Obviously a talented film maker but his uncompromising nature proving difficult even for his closest friends.,0
6397,It's a bit messy and oddly edited in a few places but it's a joy seeing an unreleased and recently finished Orson Welles project. The film is extremely self-aware and somewhat cerebral at times to the point of feeling like a Stanley Kubrick picture.,0
6398,"Posthumously reconstructed Orson Welles film is probably as haphazard and incoherent as its production history, with a complex, barely film-within-a-film plot, massive experimentation with all kinds of cinematic trickery and an overpopulated cast, but besides seemingly random shots, there are many moments of sheer beauty and pure genius.",0
6399,"Typical of Welles, this is a busy narrative, exploring the fraught thought processes of a creative mindset amongst a group of like-minded individuals, all either vying for the adulation of, or trying to discredit, a Director who flirts with the affections of others, whilst endlessly pursuing the massaging of his extremely narcissistic ego. Cinematically, the film is nigh-on flawless, with great use of angles, settings, and the constant changes between colour and black and white. That the film proper is presented in 1.37:1, while the film within the film is in 1.85:1, is testament to Welles' layered thinking as a visionary. Something I hadn't really appreciated the impact of, is that although she co-wrote the screenplay, Oja Kodar's character never speaks. And THAT sex scene! It was like a cinematic orgasm. It's such a believable story in how it's directed as a mockumentary, that it actually feels like a biopic. Given the long production, it being another of his unfinished projects, and the satirical constructs aimed at European Atmospheric Cinema (popularised in the 1960's) within the writing, it's most definitely a film that will stand for time as a monolith",1
6400,"This is IMHO the absolutely WORSE movie ever uploaded to Netflix.  OW was an iconic gifted actor (when he was young as well as a gifted director) but this film is nothing but a hackneyed spliced together disaster that Netflix decided to distribute to compliment their excellent documentary THEY'LL LOVE ME WHEN I'M DEAD.  This is nothing other than an embarrassing disaster that NFLX at a crescendo bull market at a tad over a 227 billion market cap and an 83 PE ratio has the luxury to distribute without embarrassment (TSLA is at  over a 1300 PE ratio btw).
Stay away from both stocks and this asinine movie.",0
6401,"The last film of the great Orson Welles, presents the story of an old alcoholic director disgraced by Hollywood and his ambitious pupil, on the night of his movie's debut at his luxurious house.

Thus, Welles is able to mock European Art Cinema and at the same time, tell a great narrative on ambition and betrayal.",1

I felt the acting was good as their parts fit them well. Plus it was actors you don't see that often and I get sick of the same old headliners playing all the parts these days. What a lack of variety Hollywood has become. Same actors and same old super hero/kill everybody terror movies. This was refreshing to watch. Truly.  Lots of laughs I thought and a few sad moments here and there. Some moments where you wanted to be mad at the characters but couldn't be. Lots of great characters too. I was looking for a movie to make me happy and get me out of this messed up world for a moment. This fit the bill.",1

There are a few amusing moments and I guess it raises an important topic, that of foster children and the care system in general I suppose. I'd have given it a higher rating if it weren't for the last 2-3 scenes, which tipped the balance to unavoidably/overly cliched and cheesy, I felt. The performances are good enough, especially Isabela Merced, who plays the older foster child, Lizzy.

This film is ok but I wouldn't go out of your way to see it as such and so I wouldn't especially recommend it, no.",0

6416,"A horror anthology composed of three ineffective stories tied together by a single thread with a slightly surreal Shutter Island twist. The film tries to substitute self-references and looping continuity for good writing, but doesn't really tap into the deep-seated fears that a move like that takes. The production team shows that they've got a taste for atmosphere but there's not really much to chew on, with insubstantial paranormal threats that rip off traditional horror plotlines without any development or context to make them any more than flash-in-the-pan spooks. Martin Freeman is always a pleasure to see in his sarcastically-enthusiastic mode, but it's wasted with a script like this. 

Ghost Stories is sort of like a complex knot tied by a Boy Scout in his first week. It goes all over the place and connects in strange ways, but pulling on one loose end makes the whole thing unravel. (1.5/5)",0
6417,"This is a reasonably spooky film, in a traditional supernatural way. It's more of a creepy film than it is an outright scary one as such but I like that it comes from an angle of wanting to de-bunk fake stories. Just to clarify, its not a documentary but a horror-drama film. The plot is quite good and there's a good cast, with Paul Whitehouse and Martin Freeman among the bigger names. Its certainly got a surreal side to it, present in some scenes, although for most of the film, which is set/filmed in the UK, it seems pretty realistic. There are some sudden events that might make you flinch a little but it's not what I'd regard as an overly bloody film. I thought the musical score wasn't too bad either. Yes, I'd recommend this film.",1
6418,"A well crafted anthology.  Its not terrifying, but spooky. Good firelight ghost stories",1
6419,"It's bad enough that they're a bunch of British guys from the boonies but do they have to mumble everything they say, too?",0
6420,"Based on the stage play, Ghost Stories is a movie that redeems the horror anthology after years of poor direct to video and screaming excuses for entries in the canon. It's written and directed by Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman, who stars as Philip Goodman, a famous professor and television personality who is obsessed with outing fraudulent psychics and explaining away the paranormal.

Now, he's been invited to meet his inspiration, Charles Cameron (Martin Freeman*), who was once an occult investigator just like Philip, but now is a poor man living out his last days in a trailer. He asks him to investigate three cases, which form the stories of this anthology.

The first case is that of a night watchman named Tony Matthews, whose wife has died of cancer and daughter has locked herself away from the world. Now, he's haunted by a young girl while he works. Then, a teenager obsessed with the occult accidentally runs over a demonic creature in the woods. The investigator becomes more and more unnerved by the cases, ending with the story of a banker whose wife has died in childbirth as she unleashed an inhuman child upon the world.

That's when reality falls apart and Philip can no longer explain the unknown and must face down whatever he is enduring. I don't want to give away the rug pull in this movie, but trust me that it makes sense and gives this story even more dramatic heft.

I love how the opening of this movie was inspired by faith healer Peter Popoff being exposed by skeptic and magician James Randi. It's almost exactly the way the real life incident happened.

If any movie made in the last few years deserves to be compared to the heights of Amicus, this would be it.

*Freeman and Nyman told the cast, crew and media that this role was played by Leonard Byrne, even getting Freeman to wear a prosthetic mask to further game everyone involved.",1
6421,Greatest horror movie in years with a truly creepy ending.,1
6422,"Like one of those endless dark dreams where you 'wake' to realise you are still dreaming, it's a slow burn rather than a frenetic scream fest. With surefooted acting from the cast, a tight script, and lots of visual foreshadowing using threads that are tied together in a  melancholic and disturbing twist that that isn't predictable (despite playing with nearly every horror story cliche along the way) it is satisfyingly creepy.",1

The longer I watched, the more frustrated I became. Part of me wanted to quit it while another part kept hoping it would get better; it never did. I do like twist endings, which this had, but not good enough to justify the journey getting there. Although many people apparently enjoyed it as other reviews here attest, I would not recommend it to any horror movie fan. This is one to skip; I only wish I had.",0
6425,"This is quite a frustrating watch, due to the plot development, or in other words, what happened - given its based on (I believe) a true story. It's a (perhaps timely?) reminder of how authority figures incl politicians (not all but some) can have dubious priorities and be somewhat self-centred, it could be said. The central performances are decent and it felt a pretty good film in general - with some stylish lighting/elements present. It's pretty watchable but not memorable, in as much as it isn't the kind of story I'd care to think about too much, frankly. As political biopics go (plus moral/ethical related films I suppose), its a good watch and so from that perspective it's worth seeing, hence I'd recommend it.",1

As the history said, most of the true happenings were covered up and no one will never know the complete truth,

6427,"Engrossing re-telling of some of the unseemly events that led to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne and yet another Kennedy family whitewash, this time, of its youngest son Edward Kennedy. While he may have lost some credibility over this monstrous cover-up, it seems he still shamefully allowed money and political lust for power to triumph over justice. The producers, writers Allen/Logan, and director John Curran (The Painted Veil '06) don't shy away from too many facts (but maybe don't address all) and certainly have a penchant for shining more light on this sordid show of political skulduggery. Performances are very good with Bruce Dern in the physically limited role of J.P. Kennedy Sr. who says it all with his eyes and sharp movements. 

The backroom Democrat power brokers are included, among them, the suspect (then Secretary of State) Robert McNamara perfectly portrayed by Clancy Brown - along with Speech writer Ted Sorensen, all pulling strings to concoct as convincing an alibi, of bravery-from-cowardice, as was shamelessly sold to the American public.  Ted's cousin Joe Gargan, unsuccessfully attempted to convince Kennedy to admit the truth but these manufactured lies, managed to get Ted many years in office - while it appears Mary Jo's parents were paid off for their silence.

The production design, cinematography, and music score all produce an eerie atmosphere, underpinning the sleazy situations being presented (and hidden) in the sickening world of our most powerful players. There's an excellent line attributed to Joe Gargan, in response to Ted playing down his own shortcomings by drawing attention to other famous people's flawed personalities, citing;  ""Even Moses had a bad temper"" with Joe responding;  ""Moses never left a dead girl under the Red Sea"". This production has a measured pace and while it leaves some questions unattended, still tells an important tale.",1
6428,Despite the effort of Hollywood Ted Kennedy remains a poor man,0
6429,"CHAPPAQUIDDICK is one of those movies that I'm not sure ever successfully argues for its own existence.  The telling of the true story around the fatal car accident involving Ted Kennedy and young campaign strategist Mary Jo Kopechne is straightforward and more interesting than compelling.  I was about 6 in 1969 when these events happened, but certainly later in my life, when Kennedy was running for president, I learned a fair amount about this scandal.  It absolutely marred the political fortunes of Kennedy.  But this movie has a hard time making us feel anything about the events.

Kopechne (Kate Mara, doing a nice job of juggling the mix of smart yet a bit innocent that the era seems to require) certainly did lose her life in this accident, and the few moments where the film envisions her terror are as close as we get to having a visceral response.

Most of the film, understandably, focuses on Ted Kennedy (Jason Clarke, in one of better performances I've seen him give).  It's not long after the death of Robert Kennedy and attention is focusing on him as the next and final prospect for another Kennedy presidency.  He's adored by voters, almost automatically, because of who he is and who his brothers were.  He's maligned by his father (Bruce Dern, quite scary).  And he's watched over by a cadre of friends and hangers-on, who understand to varying degrees that this is a very flawed man, whose drinking does not reveal a party-animal as much as it hides a deeply depressed person.  You never once get the sense that this Ted Kennedy has any real interest in being president (or even in politics at all), but he knows it's expected of him, it's the only way he can win his father's approval and it's all he really knows how to do.  Clarke does not play him as particularly emotionally intelligent, nor terribly sympathetically.  We feel a little sorry for him when his dad throttles him; but not enough to join team Kennedy.  The film diminishes Ted Kennedy down to an inconsequential person.  It works so hard to take him off a pedestal someone might put this man on and bring him down to earth.  But in so doing, there's not much left to admire or care about, frankly.  He genuinely feels bad about what he's done…but the fact is, he's done it.  He swam away from his sunken car in a cowardly manner and failed to call for help until it was FAR too late.  And then he can't even quite get himself on board with the coverup.  He WANTS to engage in cover-up, for certain…he just struggles to even listen to his advisors.

I also hate to say this, but the film also isn't helped by the poor supporting performances from Ed Helms and Jim Gaffigan (a favorite comedian of mine, but kinda lost in the role).  The script does them no favors in their roles as two of Kennedy's oldest friends…but these two comedic actors can't make us care about these men.  They could just as easily have been labeled as ""Friend 1"" and ""Friend 2.""

If you want to know more about the event commonly known as Chappaquiddick, this film does seem to present all the key events.  But to me, it felt like it was made either by someone who wanted to depict Kennedy as a pathetic puppet or someone who wanted to humanize a man they admired and overshot the mark.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  The film is at best, mildly interesting.",0
6430,Excellent  and  accurate,1
6431,"I thought it was a good movie overall as it captured not only the incident on the island but, what was happening in the USA at the time with the first man on the moon.

6432,"[as ‘The Senator] Clarke and Helms really make this movie. It's a story rooted in relationships and how subjective thinking can be presented as objective truths. The influences ebbing and flowing around the events as the aftermath of the crash roll on, really give the story rhythm and tension, without feeling over-dramatised. Politics, love it or hate it, is interwoven in every aspect of our lives",1
6433,"Chappaquiddick is a solid dramatisation of the interesting true story of Ted Kennedy's downfall from presidential candidacy as a result of a mysterious series of events leaving a woman dead and his advisors scrambling for damage control. Positive attributes include an emotional approach that never sinks into melodrama and a suitably ambiguous tone that allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions about the main character, played well by a habitually unsung Jason Clarke. No other cast members stand out, though. Helms, Mara, and Dern all fill voids without providing any memorability. The film expands on artistic license to imagine the fallout of the incident outside the boundaries of cold facts but never leaves the realm of conventional storytelling.",0

When the acoustic demo of Tucker's hit record from 25 years ago surfaces, its release leads to a life-changing encounter with the elusive, faded rock star but it is also about the bigger issues around people finding themselves and reassessing their lives.

6446,"Known for his intelligent screenwriting, Aaron Sorkin makes his directorial debut with ""Molly's Game"" and delivers an exceptional film, telling the story of former real-life Underground Poker Empress, Molly Bloom, played to perfection by Jessica Chastain. It does a good job at having you sympathise with its protagonist. While the film may overuse voiceovers and may have benefitted from a clearer illustration of time passage, it does not ruin the overall experience.",1
6447,"Tries really hard to make the protagonist a strong independent woman but throws it's punch so hard that it undermines her persona.

e.g. Her correcting her lawyers latin, the police making the mistake of Molly as her rather than the drug ecstasy and her getting a one up on them and especially with the ending which is so self engrossed that it forgets to be believable. 

Molly comes across more of a know it all cow rather than a strong lead. Pity. They laid the basics down and then tried to build too big a mansion

It's not without some good parts but I just feel that if it tried a little less hard, it would be infinitely more relatable and molly would be more likable.",0

I'm not sure what's supposed to appeal, the high stakes aspect or what?. Ok so its based on a true story but it just really didn't appeal to me. I watched it but I'd hardly say I followed the story fully. It didn't really grab me or entertain me at all much, although the cast is pretty decent and there's some fairly decent cinematography present - that aside, there's little on offer here really, in my humble opinion. Perhaps it'll appeal to you more than it did to me but I wouldn't personally recommend it, no.",0
6450,"3 years---- A pair of leads with endless chemistry, sharpened dialogue, and a frenetic directing style creates a home run of a film that is a near career defining performance for Chastain.",1
6451,"I had similar feelings for this as I did for The Trial of the Chicago 7.

Aaron Sorkin understands how to craft a compelling story out of true events. While there was a little too much voice-over in this one, I still enjoyed it quite a bit.",1
6452,"Acclaimed writer Aaron Sorkin makes his directorial debut with this slick drama that tells the story of Molly Bloom, and her time as an Olympic class skier turned high stakes poker game runner. With her clients said to include A-Listers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck, and Tobey Maguire, ""Molly's Game"" takes audiences to the elusive side of Hollywood full of lucrative poker games and dozens of other A-List stars. The film isn't entirely truthful to Molly's life, changing names and moving around timelines to fit Sorkin's narrative, but still manages to be a somewhat entertaining flick. 
 
Jessica Chastain gives a remarkable performance as former poker princess Molly Bloom. The film follows Bloom as she goes from an Olympic-level skier, attempting to qualify for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, but when injury strikes she is forced to kiss her dreams of an Olympic career goodbye. Finding herself in Los Angeles, Molly goes from working as a bottle service waitress to running her own poker games in both Los Angeles and New York, her clients including some of Hollywood's top stars as well as members of the Russian Mafia and the New York elite. What comes next is a strenuous legal battle, with Molly facing 10 years in prison for various offences, including illegal gambling and money laundering. 
 
Chastain leads a talented cast including Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, and Michael Cera. Elba stars opposite Chastain playing Bloom's lawyer in the film, Charles Jaffey, (who wasn't Bloom's real lawyer, but in fact a way for Sorkin to insert his own opinions into the film) his strong performance is unfortunately undermined by a patchy American accent. ""Superbad"" star Michael Cera gives a sinister turn as the mysterious and destructive ‘Player X' (a player widely believed to be based on Tobey Maguire). 
 
Aaron Sorkin once again delivers with a sharp script, full of rapid-fire dialogue that makes ""Molly's Game"" an enjoyable film, even if it does drag a little during the third act. However, the amount of poker and legal lingo in the script makes it all a little confusing for your average moviegoer, who may not be familiar with the complex world of poker. Sorkin's ability to compose an impressive script unfortunately doesn't transfer over to his directing abilities; this is a solid directorial debut from the Academy Award winner, but his directing skills aren't anything to obsess over. 
 
Chastain's turn as Molly Bloom and Sorkin's acerbic script are arguably the highlights of the film, working together to bring Bloom's fascinating story to the screen in an entertaining way, albeit accompanied by some questionable editing choices. ""Molly's Game"" not only informs viewers on the lavish lifestyle Bloom lead, but it also gives audiences an insight how this secretive world of poker works. 
 
Aaron Sorkin manages to bring an enjoyable biopic to audiences with ""Molly's Game"". A knockout performance from Jessica Chastain, strong supporting performances from Idris Elba and Michael Cera and a sharp script from Sorkin, makes the film one of the better biopics to come in recent years. However, the hefty runtime and mediocre directing job does prevent ""Molly's Game"" from leaving a bigger mark on its viewers.",1
6453,"Not a dull moment. Interesting story, good performances by Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba. Some annoying parts in the story: Kevin Costner's character making it all about him on the park bench and ignoring the child abuse that went on with Molly and her siblings by her father.",1

No idea what this was.

On the face of it, 'Mohawk' looks like it could be an interesting film - hence why I chose to watch it. That is not the case though, it is a pure waste of ninety-two minutes.

There isn't one top performer in the cast. I won't single out any individuals in a negative way, given none of them gave anything truly that much worse than their counterparts, but not one stands out positively - at a push, Ian Colletti and David La Haye would be the only ones I'd praise and they weren't even on-screen for long at all.

The scale of this is way off also. There's apparently a major war happening nearby yet we never get even an inch of incident from it. For the vast majority, it feels like you are just watching a group of people in a local forest.

6511,"I enjoyed this film. Its cheesy and a bit cliched but the songs are fun, easy to hum along with and its an easy, feel good watch. Its not especially original but thats fine as I was only looking for an easy and fun watch - it may be corny but it does have that life affirming feel to it, which sometimes is just whats needed. I imagine quite a lot of people could relate to the main character, to the themes present (feeling like you don't fit in, the obsession with fashion and skinny figures in young people etc.). Its not a film to be over analysing or expect a great deal from but for what it is, its certainly not bad. I certainly liked that the film doesn't shy away from some aspects of things, it doesn't overly sugar-coat the scenarios, what is allowed and what happens at the pageant. Danielle Macdonald gave a decent performance as the main character, Willowdean, I felt, so thats good. I reckon this is worth a watch if you have Netflix and are interested in it.",1
6512,"It must be very awkward for Rosie who's character is vain and shallow to introduce her daughter Willow-dean when she really wants her daughters best friend Ellen to be her daughter instead since she's actually good looking then fat as a Dumplin'.  Makes you wonder if a mothers love is all encompassing or in some cases just skin deep.  Even the fact her mom nickname her Dumplin' makes her oblivious to the pain she inflicts on her daughter when she calls her that in public and thinks of her in general.  Is this even a movie about a fat girl making a statement that all girls are pretty despite what they look like or one of a girl trying to find love and attention from her mother by entering a pageant that is the number one focus of her mother.  I remember when I was little, I was embarrassed by my dad because we were poor and he didn't speak very good English at the time and didn't want to be seen around him and I made him wait at the car for me after soccer practice, when he asked me in the car was it because I was embarrassed to be seen by him and the hurt look on his face, it made me realize how much of a piece of crap I was.  Family should love each other no matter what and be proud to stand beside them and never purposely hurt them for any reason.  So what if other people make fun of who you are with, that is all the more reason to stand up for them and be with them to make them feel good about themselves when others only try to tear them down.  It's one of the few lessons I learned growing up that shaped who I am today but also a reminder of how shameful experience can change your life for the better.  This movie is very relatable to me, perhaps to you as well and worth a watch.",1

This movie also features another teenaged ""big girl"" who gets a lot of air time.   Lots of positive messages which Will embodies (most of the time), from her aunt and Dolly .  Jennifer Anniston does a good job, but the writers have made her one-dimensional.  For example how does she cope with the dichotomy of working as a CNA and her self-image of  staying a beauty queen for the rest of her life)?  Not much depth, but an enjoyable, positive movie.",1
6517,"Not gonna lie. There were about 30 minutes in the middle of the movie that couldn't hold my attention. The beginning and the end were great, though. I would still recommend this movie. It was decent acting and it makes you feel good. Just probably could have been a little shorter and a little more funny in some parts as well.",1

The film talks about rigid female beauty standards, especially in Miss Teen contests and how girls who are not part of that beauty standard feel. The talent of the show showed that no matter how fat and non-standard the society is, they can be very talented with other things and make a beautiful show.
What I liked most about the movie is that it brings a message about acceptance, self-love and empathy in a light and fun way.",1

6544,"The Third Murder opens with one man brutally clubbing another to death and burning his body. But did events occur as depicted, and if so, what was the killer's motive? Despite the violent opening, The Third Murder is a slow burn drama with a focus on well-crafted and well-delivered dialogue. This dialogue concerns the accused murderer, Misumi, and his lawyer's attempts to understand his motivations so he can mount a coherent defense. Misumi is wonderfully inscrutable, and the interactions between him and Shigemori form a sort of rumination on the futility of attempting to understand evil, truth in the Japanese legal system, and the existence of fate. This is all shot with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. The end product is a beautiful and rewarding film, but one which, on account of the slow pace, it not necessarily fun to watch.",1

This is why I don't think the third murder works so well. While Shigemori is a man with demons, which Koreeda navigates beautifully as usual, the punch of this characters faults aren't as heightened and effective as they could be  with the courtroom and lawyer setting. Koreeda is at his best when he focuses on family and while this does it doesn't feel as intimate, moving or powerful. I can't really fault the writing or directing, it just lacked a bit of an emotional punch i'm so used to in Koreeda films.",0

While doing this, his sincerity, humaneness, and sense of humor come vividly across to the viewer.

The acting isn't too bad and I felt engrossed in the two mens feud - the anger/aggression seemed pretty believable. I'm not sure I can say I felt entirely sorry for them, although I certainly saw that pushy paprenting played a part in things. For a tennis film, this is surprisingly fast paced and even energetic at times - worth a watch, if your not a big sports fan as I'm not usually. As a character drama I thought it was ok, although maybe slightly depressing for some and some aspects of the mens personalities may not be entirely likeable or relatable to some - its still pretty decent and tense at the end.

The backdrop to the film is the classic 1980 Wimbledon final between the two titular figures, and it delves into their pysche off the court with great effect. Janus Metz Pederson shoots it as an art film, which is hugely effective, as it gives a different aura to the sports film. And after the horrors of the actual tennis footage in the film Wimbledon (2004,) Pederson manages to recreate the action of the match superbly, putting you right in the action, and if you know the 1980 final, you'll fully recognise many of the points he recreates.

6584,"Spoilers: I suppose this could be written off as another lesbian love affair, but it is so much more, a window into a whole, strict, Jewish, culture in England. But, wow, what a tandem, the two Rachels -- beautiful, such skilled actors. Hell, I'm in love with them, too. And rabbi Allesandro is also a nuanced go-to actor; his funeral speech from the heart, off the cuff, to bring this to climax 1, was memorable, both heartfelt moral, and intellectually honest -- he could see freedom and choice as a sign in the last words from the dearly departed rabbi Rav, and he knew what he had to do. Not just advocate for Esti's, RachelM's, freedom, but also to walk away from being a rabbi in a religion founded on myth and inadequate to reconcile his immediate dilemma -- which was the framework of this whole piece. So he declined to succeed Rav. He did choose love and understanding, freedom and choice above grueling ritual, which really can miss the substance of both the theology and the morality. But the final climax, who is with whom, was interesting after the suspenseful last 20 minutes. Yet the most interesting aspect of this film is suggestions of big questions and answers that might be halting and stumbling, though profound. How do you reconcile ""to thine own self be true"" with follow the way of God and your church/synagogue? These are the times and issues that try men's and women's souls, I suppose. And how hard is it living in a culture in which most people seemingly are nebshits who call everyone and anyone to answer any perceived violation of community morals or mores? The irony, of course, is that when Dovid, Allesandro, said ""no"" to Esti's request to let her go, everything flipped when he finally told her to be free and choose (him or Ronit, RachelW), and she chose him, her hubby. She wanted freedom and choice for both herself and the child still in her womb. Not the grinding oppression, suppression, repression and depression that her culture had foisted on her, more as bullies than knowing caregivers. Ronit's choices, including moving from England to New York to live, alienated Ronit from the widely regarded as sainted, just-deceased Rav, her Dad, and the leader of this Jewish community. And by their fruits you shall know them: Lovely Rav had cut her, his only child, out of his will without telling her, as she was expecting to inherit his house. The love scenes between the Rachels were not overly graphic, but they were as hot as we've seen, these two so unabashedly, urgently, desperately intent on sharing themselves. They didn't care how it fell in the synagogue. But after all, Esti, pregnant, could not break from her roots nor her hubby. Ronit flew home. Did morality win, lose or draw here? It's seems that sacrifices were made for each's higher good. The Rachels forwent one another, as Esti chose tradition and Ronit chose to honor Esti and Dovid's choice. Dovid conscientiously and purely left rabbinical life to be true to himself. But Esti and Dovid had one another, again, cemented by their gestating offspring. The most beautiful and hopeful moment was all three hugging one another at once, as they were at peace with their choices, though self-sacrifice and even self-abnegation were in the mix. Sounds moral, mature and altruistic to me. Freedom, choice, love and understanding had won. Thoughtful, poignant, and head and shoulders above so many films, indy or big-budget.",1

BEWARE, SPOILERS AHEAD. 

A talented female writer suffering from the condescending male world of the 1950 where she wouldn't stand a chance to be taken seriously falls in love with her literature professor, whose writing ability is (quote from the film) ""wooden at best"". The two make a secret pact: she does the writing and he publishes under his name. Their union becomes increasingly successful and holds for many decades, until during the Nobel Prize celebrations in the early 90es everything breaks apart.

So, IF this were based on a REAL story, I would accept it as such: the ups and downs in the life of a very particular couple, where a talented wife agrees to disappear behind the untalented but world-famous (and philandering) husband. But this is a work of fiction. I might add, of gender politics fiction and of character fiction. Even with the horrific gender politics of the 1950s I simply refuse to believe that men can cowardly hide behind their wives for decades cashing in the success for something they have no clue how to achieve - and I also simply refuse to believe that women are such cowards to not break out sooner or later (rather sooner, say in the 1960s when Erica Jong and others made their appearance) and reveal the truth to the world - whatever the cost for their marriage. 
Long story short: I simply don't believe the plot and the characters' actions. Therefore, THE WIFE gets exactly half of the available stars from me as a reverence to the cast and crew.",0

6607,Game night is a beautiful comedy addition to the cinema with great comedic moments mixing dark and adult humour and charismatic performances from the leads that just have you tensed and cracking up and different scenes throughout the whole movie. It's smart and funny where it needs to be and its play on coincidences can't do anything but make you laugh. An awesomely fun time that definitely deserves a watch.,1

6609,"Avengers: Infinity War is the pinnacle of what a movie franchise should lead up to. A collection of characters who have all had their share of experiences and movies to make the audience relate to and love. The Russo brothers excelled in making sure the film stayed on track while making sure each character gets their screen time. They switch to different characters constantly and yet the audience stays hooked throughout. And the ending where the heroes don't win is by far something that has never been done before, at least in a live-action superhero movie at this scale. And it isn't just the fact that they lost, but how they lost. Each hero was at their prime, yet this villain, who is clearly delusional and evil yet the audience can still understand their motive, is able to tear down each of them so easily. The themes, the arcs, the storytelling, were all so great and is the reason why this film is by far the greatest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1
6610,"It was an amazing movie it was funny, good action and the story was fantastic. If you haven't seen it I would totally watch it and then if you loved it you can watch the sequel endgame. It finished off amazingly making you want to see a sequel",1

6612,"My favourite MCU movie to date. Fits it's huge cast of characters into the movie well. Great plot with plenty of emotion and climactic moments and character crossovers that give the movie it's grandiose feeling. *SPOILERS* The ending to this movie twisted the stereotypical ""heroes win""  outcome and wasn't afraid to leave the characters and world in a total mess at the end, which is exactly what makes the ending so fantastic.",1
6613,Such a cool start to the conclusion of phase 3. Great cast and I can’t believe they are able to find so many actors that act so well together,1

6615,A great build up to this point forces a lot of expectations on this film and they do well to deliver with some issues here and there. Thanos is given a lot of focus where you can see his immense power and dedication to his cause. His followers seem to be formidable foes on their own but are not given enough recognition to be viewed as legitimate threats. Most of the heroes were given faithful adaptations of while some had changes made that hurt the characters and their story. The action is some of the best out of the whole MCU with unique team-ups and fun character involvement. The final battle is intense and leaves us at the ending wanting more and excited for the future.,1

Pochi personaggi ma sufficienti ad orchestrare una storia adatta a toccare in modo delicato corde sensibili, trasmette un senso di grande amarezza attraverso un progressivo susseguirsi di mancanze che accompagnano verso un finale che lascia lo spettatore nello stesso senso di inadeguatezza e smarrimento che avvolge la protagonista.",1

The main character is a completely talentless actress that probably got this role by ""other means"" if you know what I mean. This movie stinks so bad. What a waste of time!!  A perfect example of horrible moviemaking.",0
6625,Riseborough is terrific in this intriguing psychological drama. Not for everyone with its slow pacing and melancholic atmospherics. But I was drawn in and thoroughly engrossed to the end.,1

6627,"Loved it! Andrea Riseborough is superb! So captivating. Already admired her, but she's just shot up even further in my estimation. Probably my favourite actress right now. And the film is so good too. It's so sweet and bleak and Nancy is such a twisted, sad but lovable character. And the story is a really interesting and clever one and it was filmed very well, with class and good pace and timing and sensitivity. Really, one the best movies I've seen in a long time. ",1
6628,"Not a fan of this.  It leaves so many questions unanswered and not in a good way that makes you think about it a lot afterward.  It's more along the lines of, ""Oh... that's it?""  It's an extremely slow burn.  It's a drama, s don't be misled thinking you're in for a thriller.",0

6632,Why was the funeral scene so long? It took all the oxygen out of the movie.,0
6633,Brilliantly filmed. ,1
6634,I believe the documentary offers a very genuine and matter of fact snapshot of a town not much different from many towns this size in the Midwest.  What is remarkable is the apparent concerted effort to keep things the same.  After 175 years of virtually nothing changing this town has been forced to accept what happens when an apathetic public isnt engaged in decision making. The political climate isn't as one sided here as people might think.  The town generally has been guided by common sense and generous long time sons and daughters of homesteaders. I know..... I grew up there and still have many relatives as well as friends.,1

6636,"I'm a 42 year old documentary lover so rest assured that I have the attention span to handle a slower film. This one pushed my patience. It is technically flawless. Some scenes were quite clever, particularly those of the town council. They tell an amusing story. However, almost all other scenes felt disjointed, and many felt unnecessary. The one at the veterinarian's office was bizarrely out of place, has no relevance to the location, and it was off-putting. I've never been to a doc where people got up and left. At this one, they did-at various points. I assume, due to boredom. I appreciate that every filmmaker has their own style but I genuinely don't see this as worthy of 89% fresh. It's a critic's darling.",0

More and more Art just keeps flowing in and around this man.",1
6641,"A visually stunning, occasionally humorous though not especially engaging documentary about a fashion industry icon and his journey from the Jim Crow South to international celebrity. While the protagonist's story is an inspiring one, the chronicle of his story feels flat in light of the life he's lived and the journey he's taken. Perhaps if the filmmakers had given viewers more of a reason to care about the subject matter and its central character this might have worked better. As it stands now, though, it's moderately interesting but not the kind of offering that reaches out and grabs your attention.",0
6642,Great Documentary. Provided awesome insight into someone I had always seen but didn’t know much about.,1
6643,"Andre makes the extraordinary look ordinary. His passion for fashion was an enveloping effort and an all consuming one at that, that at the end left him at the end of his career lonely and physically unhealthy. His impact on society was that he never emphatically put himself out there as a social justice warrior where in his time he had all the right to be, but he instead chose to internalize all the slights and many forms of racism put his way ultimately shaping who he was as a as a person and as a journalist. The movie was as entertaining as the subject himself. It’s sad that no one has come to be the next Andre and the hope of this movie is to one day inspire the next Andre Talley.",0
6644,"This is a very atmospheric Western crime drama film, with some potential mild(ish) jump scares. I liked the somewhat menacing, slow drawn out chords played in the background. Its got quite a 'mean and moody' feel to it. The script is quite decent, with some thoughtful dialogue and the characterisation is good too, with John C. Reilly playing the more aloof, introverted one (Eli), while Joaquin Phoenix plays the less subtle, more openly aggressive one (Charlie). Watching the two argue things out makes for a tense and unsettling watch at times, with a definite volatility being present.

However, I can't say I was overly convinced by, or otherwise keen on, Jake Gyllenhaal's Western accent (needless to say, this is no Brokeback Mountain) but otherwise its a fine film, with some surprisingly good instances of cinematography and so I'd recommend it.",1
6645,Not lively enough for so many dark scenes and close-ups.   There wasn't much reason to care about what the Sisiters brothers were doing and it was all that there really was to focus on.,0
6646,"Gorgeous on-location shots and excellent production design. A focus on characters lends each of them sufficient development so as to not be a caricature like in many other westerns. The story has an interesting message of redemption, change and greed, but there isn't too much to it, not leaving the viewer with much to consider after or even during the film.",0
6647,"The acting crew of Ahmed, Gyllenhaal, Phoenix and Reilly is formidable.  Unfortunately, the execution of this movie is not.  The story seemed promising, I think I'll give the book a try.",0
6648,"Completely unique experience with the western style movie, curious transformation of the genre and breathtaking acting.",1
6649,"Kinda loving the current Western revival, but this is a no for me.  TBH, I don't care for most of Gyllenhaal's stuff. Yeah he has chops, but overall his stuff is just kind of blah to me. 

He is always these fish-out-of-water charcters and it hard/tiresome to really focus on them for a full movie. If you want to watch a movie to appreciate acting, then this (like any Gyllenhaal movies) is for you. But as an enjoyable story, nah..  Skillfully crafted but ultimately kinda boring.",0

6651,Ok ish western . A different from the usual western good cast,0
6652,Overall its an original and interesting film which keeps you guessing as to the direction it will go but the film title irritated me as its clearly a play on words and the film has a reasonably abrupt ending. I don't know if they edited out much from the book but the ending seemed rushed.,0

6655,Such a great story and movement whole the time. Not even 1 minute boring. Great job done here!!!,1
6656,"The thriller elements themselves won't change the wheel but the movie knows that giving you a fast-paced story that still let you room to breath and investigate with the characters without giving you too much time to easily predict where the story is going. The movie strength really is the use of uncommon elements for the genre, like comedy, sunny and colorful sceneries and one atypical main protagonist in the center of it all. It's a fun (and great) thriller without being a parody of the genre.",1
6657,"This is categorised as a comedy film but I'd first like to say that, to me, its more of a mystery drama. The main character is a bit of a light head type but I didn't, personally, find that aspect especially amusing, although the main plot about the strange disappearance of her new friend did intrigue me.

There are a number of plot twists and it kept me guessing. I thought it was quite engrossing and Anna Kendrick gave a particularly good performance as said main character (Stephanie Smothers). So, overall I'd say this is not what it may first appear to be and its a good watch if you like a mystery drama type watch. Yes, I'd recommend this film to others.",0
6658,Great movie! Very much enjoyed it! Good plot with lots of twists and turns.,1

6660,"It's like an R rated Nancy Drew movie. A Simple Favor is twisty (allllllmost to a fault), low stakes, and a lot of fun. Once the mystery completely unravels it loses some of its luster but Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively do a great job carrying the movie through its weaker moments.",1
6661,So fun! Loved it! Blake Lively looks amazing as always and especially in her gorgeous clothes! Suspenseful and hilarious.,1

6664,Depressing story that didn't go anywhere.,0
6665,"I absolutely loved this movie, and the twist at the end. I was a little shocked reading some of these other reviews. People are either criticizing the twist (which is the point of the whole movie), or talking about how it's a story of ""first-world problems."" I think that's an incredibly hurtful and honestly, ignorant opinion, considering the stigma around postpartum depression and the incredible amount of responsibility that's put on new mothers. The people saying this is about middle-class/first-world problems either have no understanding of motherhood or just plain lack empathy.",1
6666,Tully is a decent film. It is about a struggling mother of three who forms an unexpected bond with the night nanny hired to help with her newborn baby. Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis give good performances. The script is a little slow in places. Jason Reitman did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama and mystery.,1
6667,"This is an ok watch. It depicts one clearly very tired mother who is put under a lot of stress due to her kids and finds a more youthful side to her via the newly employed nanny. I imagine a lot of people can relate to the situation...its not exactly funny but its somewhat entertaining and perhaps re-assuring to see how things develop. It features some reasonably strong language and sex references, so its not one for the whole family to watch. Its a bit amusing and mildly entertaining but no more than that, I'd say. I suppose I'd recommend this,  yes, if only for the depiction of a down beaten youngish mum regaining her youthful identity.",0

6669,"For whatever reason, Netflix described this as a comedy/drama (e.g., dramady). Yeah, it has a couple cute laughs here and there but seriously? Does Netflix actually watch these movies before categorizing them? This is straight up drama and very well done.",1
6670,"Charlize Theron is excellent in this film. You can feel her exhaustion by just watching her. It's subtle, it's simple and that makes it so real. I had seen this film about three years ago but I had forgotten the twist. That was done very well.

6671,"Thought the movie was well acted.  I was a little unsettled at some parts but the end may have settled it out for me.  It was funny enough, real enough and I enjoyed it.",1
6672,"Tully subverted my expectations a few times. It sure felt like a typical middle class drama for a while...until the ""night nanny"" Tully actually shows up. She passes no judgment, she accepts the family for who they are, and as she says ""helps them bridge the gap."" It made me think about how I was actually approaching this movie and how that relates to how I approach people. It's easy to make assumptions about what ""category"" people fall into instead of just seeing them for who they are. The movie itself was fine. Not earth shattering, but I have to hand it to the direction for making its themes crystal clear without being overly heavy handed.",1
6673,"Tully's ending is very confusing and sort of muddles the entire movie. With that said, the film is very well acted, particularly with Charlize Theron's performance as the overworked mother, Marlo.",0
6674,"While a very good film, it completely ignores the main character's back story. This leaves the viewer wondering why Willi has such a bloodlust for German deserters. It only makes sense if you know that he was a trained paratrooper, a veteran of 2 years of hard combat. At the same time, he was a pathological liar and probably quite mad. 

There was a lot of really interesting stuff in his life that was skipped over. 

It's a good movie, but it doesn't really tell the story. It just gives you a blurry snapshot of a short period of time in what was actually a much more interesting life.",1
6675,"This movie makes you feel uncomfortable to watch, and this is a good thing if you're watching a film that is in the war genre; the black and white color adds to the suspense that you will feel while watching this movie, and the acting is super great this is truly a masterpiece and a must watch the film in the war genre",1

Very well shot, great assemblage of characters, and based on real life events to boot! Dark, disturbing, somewhat harrowing but I am glad I got to watch it.",1
6682,"This is a fine film on the horrors of war, but also the power trip that can come simply with a uniform and the power and/or prestige that can come with it. Similar to other films, such as Young Lions, where a deserter poses as an officer to escape the fate of imprisonment or worse, The Captain has a great lead performance by Max Hubacher.
The use of black & white maintains the starkness of war and the times. This is not supposed to be a film where we appreciate the beauty of the scenery or nice homes. 
There is something of a rote sense to the writing early on. It's once they're at Camp II and then later after they are in a city and devolve into debauched hedonistic behavior that the movie is most effective. 
Other good performances come from Milan Peschel, Frederick Lau and Waldemar Kobus. 3.3 stars",1
6683,"In April 1945, during the final weeks of the war, Willi Herold (Max Hubacher), a young Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper) escapes the pursuit of a roving German military police commando that wishes to kill him for deserting. After his escape, Herold finds an abandoned car containing the uniform of a decorated Luftwaffe captain. Herold takes the uniform and impersonates a captain, taking command of a number of stragglers as he moves through the German countryside under the guise that he is on a mission, ordered by Hitler himself, to assess morale behind the front. Although initially promising the local populace a decrease in looting, Herold becomes increasingly despotic as more disparate troops join his command, named Kampfgruppe Herold. These troops include Freytag, a kind, aging rifleman who is made Herold's driver, and Kipinski, a sadistic drunk. Eventually, Kampfgruppe Herold find a German camp full of deserters awaiting execution and assumes control over operations there...

Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, ""The Captain makes chillingly persuasive points about the dark side of human nature -- and underscores how little certain tendencies ever really change.""

This WWII movie shows the insanity of war and what it can do to a any man. It´s based on the real Willi Herold (1925 – 1946), also known as ""the Executioner of Emsland,"" whow was a German war criminal. Near the end of World War II in Europe, Herold deserted from the German Army and, posing as a Luftwaffe captain, organized the mass execution of deserters held at a German prison camp. Herold was arrested by British forces and executed for war crimes on 14 November 1946 at Wolfenbüttel prison. ""Der Hauptmann"" has great cinematography, acting, props, attention to details, environments and a general disturbing vibe that fits. And having been shot in black and white adds so much to the look and feel.",1
6684,"Great photography, beautiful scenery, a smooth and pleasant narrator's voice, and sometimes appropriate orchestral music. However, at no time is the location stated, no height, and no information regarding how many times, if any, a peak has been conquered, or how many deaths may have occurred while attempts to conquer were conducted.

Don't watch this video if you're tired... it'll put you to sleep. Show it on your widescreen, flat, wall-mounted TV during your party -- it's good for background sights and sounds.",0

6686,Great photography and sound track.  Some of the climbing scenes quite disturbing as they are so extreme. Film questions and challenges our modern relationship with mountains.   Thought provoking and interesting.,1
6687,"This film is dripping with beautiful footage of beautiful mountains. It is scored by a lovely suite of music performed by a wonderful orchestra. So far, so David Attenborough. What this film then fails to do, to continue the Attenborough comparison, is tell an engaging story or give some incredible insight into the world. It instead gives Willem Dafoe a poetic, ponderous voiceover that kind of tells you things, but doesn't go into detail. It's a mood piece, which I thought would be fine as it's only 70-odd minutes long, but I have to say I was pretty bored at points. There's also a section where it talks about adrenalin junkies who do ridiculous things on the top of or off the top of mountains. But again, by relying entirely on the dream-like narration and not speaking to these people directly to explain themselves, I had no context or meaning for what they were doing and had to make do with Willem's speculation. I was just left looking at these people and what they were doing and how expensive and dangerous it must be, and thinking ‘some arseholes have too much money'. If you're a fan of getting stoned, I do think it'd be a good one to watch when high. Us crazy carts who prefer to be lucid and switched on the whole time, it just felt like a poor man's episode of Planet Earth.",0
6688,"Absolutely stunning visual and audio combination to encapsulate the true essence of great heights. This documentary shows a variety of the worldâ(TM)s best mountains from wonderful perspectives. The soundtrack matches the screenplay perfectly, truly envoking deep emotions. A must watch to any outdoors enthusiast.",1
6689,"When I was really in the mood to unwind, I stumbled across this documentary. It's called Mountain, and it was meant to be sick! It had an excellent rating on Rotten Tomoatoes... CERTIFIED FRESH!
In a brief summation: I fell asleep. The movie only goes for an hour and ten minutes... But, God, did it drag on. It was just so boring. It had no narrative (or any real thought behind it), just a whole bunch of stock footage of actual mountains, with Willem Dafoe saying arbritrary, philosophical and poetic things about mountains! Then to top it off, the sounctrack is random classic music. Now, I'm a huge fan of the musical arts, but this was the 'hot toddy' that put me to sleep.
In hindsight, I might have been awestruck, had I been on acid. But in all honesty, 'Mountain', as a whole, is more fitting as a screensaver than a movie. (Seriously, turn the volume down so Willem Dafoe's voice is just a whisper, and I promise you... PERFECT SCREENSAVER!)",0
6690,"MOUNTAINEERS ""baraka"".",1
6691,"As an advanced mountain / rock climber who has climbed a number of the mountains and faces featured in the film, I was extremely underwhelmed by this film. There was very little depth whatsoever to the film, and it came across to me as a completely incoherent mishmash of pseudo-intellectual dialogue, meaningless information, and overwhelmingly annoying and often ill-matched classical music. I found it completely disheartening how the filmmakers managed to completely fail to capture the feeling of climbing, and why we climb. The lack of context makes it impossible for the casual viewer to understand how ground-breaking the opening footage of the free solo of el sendero luminoso by alex honnold is, or how equally mundane the footage of the 5.4 Pigeon Spire route is 15 minutes later in the film - the utter lack of any context for any of the footage is a real disgrace.",0
6692,Beautiful visuals but music drowns out the narrator.  Issue with final mix?  Would also have liked to know the names of the mountains.,0
6693,"- When cinematic poetry meets wild exhilaration in Mountain -

There have been a few times in my life when I have felt truly privileged to view the world in a particular way, once while deep sea diving and another time while paragliding. Wow, I thought, not many people get to see the world this way.
Mountain, by director Jennifer Peedom (Sherpa, Miracle on Everest), took me to that same place of wonder.

""The mountains we climb are made not only of rock and ice, but also of dreams and desire,"" narrator Willem Dafoe crooned as my heart raced up a cliff-face, was dazzled by sunlight on crystal snowflakes, and shocked by the roar of avalanches. I was swept up in the majesty of mountains.

While Peedom's 2015 BAFTA Award-nominated documentary Sherpa delves into the risks sherpa's take for wealthy thrill-seekers on Everest, Mountain is more of a tribute to both mountains themselves, and the brave souls who feel the call to conquer them. This is a tone poem of grand proportions.

The documentary is a collaborative masterpiece. We are captivated by the extraordinary words written by Robert MacFarlane, the beautiful score by the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) and the incredible footage compiled and shot by Peedom and cinematographer Renan Ozturk whose partnership began with Sherpa.  

In a Q&A session at the New Zealand International Film Festival, Peedom explained that it all started with the music. The ACO came to Peedom with the idea to do something with mountains. Richard Tognetti, the principal violinist and artistic director, was fascinated by mountaineers and by Ozturk's mountain footage.

The project was originally designed as a concert work, with the ACO touring with it across Australia. But it was important to Peedom that the film stood as a stand-alone narrative piece.

During Peedom's early years as a climbing camera operator, she had been captivated by the book Mountains of the Mind by Robert MacFarlane. It explored the revolution of our feelings towards mountains, where only 300 years ago climbing a mountain was thought lunacy. Peedom invited MacFarlane to collaborate on the film and the themes of his book became the overarching thesis of the documentary along with Peedom's own experience. As someone who had felt the allure and siren song of the mountain, she wanted to express her experience as well.

About 30% of the film was shot with colleague Ozturk, supplemented by his own incredible library of footage, as well as that of other mountain cinematographers, resulting in over 2,000 hours of footage, across 15 countries. The technology utilized in this environment was cutting edge, with the cinematographers pushing the limits of what drones were able to do.

In the Q&A, Peedom explained that mountaineering is a ""very blokey world."" She said that she kinda becomes one of the boys in that environment as she is usually one of the only women on expedition. But while it might be blokey, she says many of the mountaineering men are beautifully romantic souls, including Ozturk himself. In saying that, she did try to put as many women in the film as she could and she herself brought a feminine gaze to it as well.  

Mountain is an inspiring, soul-nourishing, and at times clench-butt-cheeks scary, sensory experience. If you're lucky enough to see it with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, then you can count yourself very lucky. The rest of us will need to find the biggest screen we can in order to be fully absorbed into this magnificent treasure.

6695,I really enjoy end of the world/humanity type films and this one was really solid. Martin Freeman is stellar of course. The story keeps on giving when you think its almost over.

6697,"'Cargo' suffers from some pacing issues, and some elements of the story feel as if they could've benefited from some further polishing, but Freeman delivers - as always - in this unusual zombie flick that puts character and questions like 'what would you do?' over the gore that's so abundant in zombie movies of recent memory.",1

6705,"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IT IS A TRAP *contains spoilers*

You see the picture of Juliette Binoche looking all carefree and you think something good is going to happen but no, she just messes around with a lot of men and is messed around by a lot of men, nobody learns anything, and then Gerard Depardieu is there at the end for some reason. If this movie was made when Roland Barthes wrote the story, sure, maybe it would have been fresh. But it belongs in the past.",0

6707,A contemporary romantic drama on a very small scale. It's human and relatable.,0
6708,"Juliette Binoche is fantastic in a dreadful film.  So this is the story of a girl who cried a river and drowned the whole world.  There is nothing compelling here and after this hubby and wife date morning film we were both left scratching our heads as to how this got on our list of movies to watch.  It's depressing and there's nobody to root for.  French films are different.  Claire Denis co-wrote and directed a movie that needs to explain every detail of what is going on and then just in case you missed it it will explain it again, yet somehow one can come away confused.  Do yourself a favor, don't watch or turn it off after you see Binoche naked in the opening scene.  Wife: 5.4/Hubby 5.0 Average Final Score: 5.2/10",0

Although it is not a bad thing that characters are unlikable; it is a bad thing when they are uninteresting.   And they are all uninteresting.  The conversations reveal nothing but the self absorption of each individual.   And for goodness sake, nobody talks the way these people talk.   I was looking at my watch ten minutes in to this trudge of a film.  Save your money.",0
6711,Such a terrible movie! The main character sleeps around like no tomorrow and then cries about it later when they run away! Shocking! ,0
6712,"'It's like my love life is behind me,' says Isabelle. 'It's all over. There's nothing left.' This from a more than charming 50 mid-life character for whom opportunities would seem abundant. What she desires is simply warm, intimate, empathizing desire-provoking companionship from the other gender.
I loved the movie and wanted to see it again, but even in Portland, Oregon, where theaters for ""independent movies"" often keep filling seats for long runs, Let the Sunshine In was gone in days. And yet, for me this film worked so well that I cannot come up even with even a quibble, 
Here is my take on what Let the Sunshine In was designed to do and accomplished superbly.

I think that now in her seventies, Claire Denis tried to base her character portrayals and story line on what she has learned about how men and women have complementary, yet too often conflicting aspirations for emotional and affectionate desire - more often conflicting aspirations from differing gendered biology and socialization for male-female roles. As a consequence, most of their ""relationships"" are deeply problematic. For Isabelle, the disappointments are understandable given what the men in her life bring to their interactions - male confusion at best and at worst, totally self-centered exploitation.  

The ending for this movie - praised most critics I have read -- is set up by a brief scene introducing a ""clairvoyant"" Isabelle consults. He has just experienced his own disconnect with his wife, we learn from a brief scene suggesting his own emotional hang-over when the clairvoyant comments about each man in Isabelle's life when she meets him. Viewers can decide for themselves if the unusual but aesthetically beautiful ""postscript"" in which Isabelle talks with her ""counselor-clairvoyant"" while credits roll to the left is as affirming as it was for me.

My own take, which I will reconsider when I get a chance to see Let the Sun Shine In again with PAL conversion capability from a European DVD I have ordered, is that as protagonist, Isabelle, looking back meaningfully, has come to understandings that might help her find the intimate companionship she believes she should have if she encounters more ""promising: men, but always risking disappointment and having to move on in the hopeful but not desperate spirit of  ""letting the sunshine in."" Not a cynical resignation to ""whatever!"" but openness to the vicissitudes in all encounters with human beings who perforce bring different gendered backgrounds to bear. 

This was a profoundly inspiring and affirming movie for me, at least from the first viewing. Let's grant that the subsidies for films made abroad allow for the gentle telling for which the camera is more of a window to the world, minimizing fast juxtapositions, allowing subtle irony and humor, for which Eric Rohmer was notable. For his movies, a profound, but subtle irony often ended the story. Denis' resolution is more complex this time but equally subtle.

PS: Folks who find nudity and the portrayal of sexual desire, however well done, disruptive for their enjoyment and expectation in romantic comedies as a genre will probably be disappointed and/or upset by the opening scene, which plunges into the worst of her engagements for erotic pleasure.",1
6713,Top level work from Binoche and Denis.,1
6714,"Amazing is the only word that comes to mind when thinking of this film. Akhavan incredibly manages to portray queerness and everything behind it in a context were it is not widely accepted. We are presented with different teenagers that deal with that queerness in many different ways. Most important, queer people can feel identified with this film towards their very own process of acceptance and understanding and how the world views that process. Quite a refreshing film.",1
6715,"Big fan of Chloe Grace Moretz. I'm yet to see her in anything where I haven't liked her. This is a serious tone shift from a lot of the other movies I've seen her in and she's great as usual. The Miseducation of Cameron Post is an intentionally infuriating film about a gay conversion boarding home for teenagers. While not necessarily surprising, it is absolutely wild that this trash is still legal anywhere in the US. The narrative doesn't always sustain itself all that well, but there are a lot of scenes that are immensely powerful.",1
6716,"This is a good film, although its (understandably) a tough watch in places. Its thought provoking and Chloe Grace Moretz gives a good performance. I would recommend this film.",1
6717,taken me to a world I did not know existed. Truely the greatest gift a film can give. Featuring the best actor to walk this earth didn't hurt either.,1
6718,Sonic is a lord king lord lord of lord,0
6719,"Understated and realistically bleak view of conversion therapy in the 1990s. Exposes this pseudoscientific nonsense for the train wreck that it always has been. The adults are, as one teen observes towards the end, just making it up as they go along. I'd have preferred more laughs, but what I got was an honest view of something I'll remain happy never to experience. 5 stars for being earnest without being overdramatic.",1
6720,"Compelling performance from Moretz is a great addition to its innovative, well-told story. Giving us an evocative look at the LGBT community.",1
6721,"The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a 2018 drama film directed by Desiree Akhavan 🍿

6722,There were parts of this that worked like the acting and the subject matter but it all came together in a movie that dragged and was kind of boring.,0
6723,"I usually like films with Jennifer Ehle; however, this one missed the mark. It just felt like a very anti-Christian film made purely to attack that religion. I was left wondering if this would have even been made if the conversion religion was Islamic? I ended up fast-forwarding to get to the end.",0
6724,"Big Eyes for writers. a fascinating film, well told.",1
6725,"This 2018 film is gorgeously photographed and directed, and perfectly acted by Keira Knightley and others. It isn't for everyone, but then neither was the real Colette.",1
6726,"This film is open about the way bi/lesbian women had to live 100 years ago.  The heroine is a role model for the modern woman, not just about sexuality, but to find who they are and live their authentic self.",1
6727,"Absolutely captivating.  Keira Knightly is superb, the production is ultra-beautiful and the story line is fascinating - especially in light of the fact that it's based on historic events and people.  I can't say enough about how riveting this film was.",1
6728,Keira Knightley was fabulous in the role of this brilliant writer & actress who marries a controlling older man during a time in history when that was expected. He uses her talent to make the money he spends freely while taking all the credit for the success of the books she authors. Thankfully she finds happiness and love after discovering her attraction to women with one in particular dressing as a man…Well done!!,1
6729,"I found this an interesting film in terms of the plot, given its based on a true story. Loosely speaking, its about female independence and empowerment (or the lack of it), in the time its set in - the early 1900s. I liked the determination Colette showed in the face of the social landscape she finds herself in. I like how she stands up for herself and I felt Keira Knightley did well in her performance, while Dominic West also does well as Colettes husband, Willy, who sounds really quite intimidating when he tries to force her to keep writing on his behalf, claiming its for their own good etc.

I especially liked that at the end, we're shown what I assume to be real historical photos of Colette accompanied with text explaining what happened in her life after the time the film ends at. Its always nice to see details about the real story after the dramatised depiction, or adaptation, of it. I say that as obviously I can't vouch for how accurate it is but its certainly very much a watchable film, one I'd recommend.",1
6730,"It's intressting to see how her husband stole her work, cheated on her and exploited her but still claimed to be in love until the last minutes of the movie. I'm not a big fun of LGBT+ scenes but whatever.",0
6731,Overrated by critics... Lame.... I hate when directors put contemporary politics into historical films. This is a Trump era reaction film..... I thought it was preachy and boring and did no justice to the historical figures or story.,0
6732,"Not as remarkable as the woman, but it's good.",1
6733,"An interesting, rarely insipid, and sometimes good watch. Knightley and West are good and make the film by themselves. The plot is a bit flaccid, as it fills the runtime with sexual intrigue rather than the genuinely interesting. The main conflict stays shrouded until the last third, by which point the film has somewhat lost you. However, one must give the film marks for Knightley's compelling portrayal of one of history's most interesting characters, and the film overcomes its narrative difficulties with a low-key, varied examination of her character. There are no real concrete supporters apart from West, though Eleanor Tomlinson does her best to derail proceedings with a truly awful American accent extracted from the depths of miserable acting. No disrespect to her; I'm sure she has better performances elsewhere. Fiona Shaw is welcome, and I would have liked to see more of her. Gough is also alright without wowing in a unique role. At least the film manages to broach topics of societal stigmas and sexism without ever feeling particularly heavy-handed or hackneyed. Ultimately, I find that it is more of a positive symbol and an important representation than an excellent film, but objectively one can easily understand why this was well-received.",0
6734,"More like a video game, but kinda predictable. I think this is a homage to the older sci-fi films like Matrix, TXH1138 and among other big names. The effect looks so retro reminds me something like Tron.",0
6735,Upgrade is a film that walks the thin line between being gleefully bloody and depressingly dystopian. Awkwardly but eventually successfully.,1
6736,"Phenomenal movie all around! I just watched it again after the first time it came out. I wish they would make more movies like this that have amazing writing, action, and a thrilling ride with twists. Bravo to the whole production team and everyone else involved! ",1
6737,Interesting concept. Very violent.,0
6738,Very create and fun action. Along with some good world building and great perfomace from the lead!,1
6739,"Conceptually surrounded by familiar mechanical routines between machinery possession and vigilantism, especially when both already found an established mixture of defining an entertainment value with unique art. This mode favors wittedly and expressively within the action sequences adding onto the dark humor as partial realization as it progresses whilst also contributing to the man vs. machine bonding narrative with foreseen twists. The way the action sequences were shot engages aesthetically on captivating degree but distracted by the typically unappealing violence that actually underlined sympathy amid a moral complexion between obsession and possession. Intelligently bolstered but dampened by unnecessary extremity regarding the generic lengths for violence as other films, more or less favorable, performed and story-told better around what this film decided to show as result for the impressive action. (B)",1
6740,"Es una historia muy triste, lo manipulable que las ""Elites"" puedes llegar a logar en las personas quebrantadas, en lo particular muy buena historia muy buen guion y una excelente historia.",1
6741,"A very interesting concept. Dialogue and character development could have been a little better, but overall really well done.",1
6742,"Great action, believable characters and nice twist, even if it wasn't shocking.",1
6743,"To be clear, this isn't some heady cyperpunk sci-fi flick like Blade Runner despite the shared DNA. I likened it most to the video game franchise Deus Ex. While it has all of the same tropes of the genre as something like Blade Runner, it's just all a little silly at the same time and I think there's definitely a place for something like this in a media world that takes cyberpunk sci-fi a little too seriously. That all said, Upgrade employs a lot of the same themes the genre loves: autonomous AI, the blurred lines between humanity and technology, and simulation vs. reality. It's honestly just a very good movie. It dips its toe into enough of the ""serious"" cyberpunk tropes to get your fix but also manages to be a breezy action movie (with some laugh out loud over the top violence mind you) at the same time. Logan Marshall-Green always strikes me as trying too hard when he's acting...but I still just really like him. Maybe I'm just misty eyed about his tragic character in the OC still.",1
6744,Somewhat unpleasant but Mary Elizabeth Winstead should have gotten all the awards.,0
6745,I wasn't expecting an indie character study lead by the always-convincing Winstead to be so uproarious and amusing. The ending is such a low-blow stalemate that would serve better as a second act in this kind of story.,0
6746,"I usually love Common and Mary Elizabeth Winslow... but neither of them could save this script.  Oh my God, it's awkward.",0
6747,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead isn't someone I would've pegged to nail a role as a stand-up comedian. However, she does a tremendous job and takes an otherwise okay film up a notch with her work. She has good chemistry with Common and her on-stage monologue is fantastic, though it does feel like a big change for the film's tone.",0
6748,"Good movie, funny, human and harsh.   Good job making a movie that was reasonable to watch while addressing a difficult subject head on.",1
6749,"What a tough movie to endure, only because of the stomach-churning issues that the writer and the lead actors bring. I found this by watching another movie starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, called ""The Parts You Lose"", and looking for her movie history. Aha! ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" Sure, I've seen that. But this? Never heard of it but I was intrigued because of the angle of her as a comedian. What I was not prepared for was the depth of her performance here as Nina. I'd not seen Common before and had no idea of his chops but he was okay here. Not much required, not much delivered.
Bottom line? I watched it two nights in a row to get more out of it. No mistake there. I wish I could have a David Letterman or a similar long-form interview show with Elizabeth. She, and the movie - they're keepers.",1
6750,"The first 2/3 all characters are really off-putting and I even thought about quitting the film, but the twist/reveal makes everything fall into place. Even though this movie is pretty explicit at times, it does very well fit the whole story.",1
6751,"All About Nina is a movie about an edgy stand-up comedian who is going through many life struggles and is looking for a road to success (in her career and her life.) I’m a fan of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and I think she is a great actress with good comedic timing. However, there’s a big difference between the timing needed to make the humor of a scene work, and the timing needed to make stand-up comedy work. This movie shows me that Winstead should stick to the acting and leave the stand-up to the professionals. Of course, the writing is doing her no favors. The “jokes” in her routines are merely crass references that lack any genuine insight or wit. It’s as if we’re merely supposed to be laughing because she’s being edgy and inappropriate. Eva Vives really needed a good female comedian to consult on the script and punch up all the stand-up routines (and perhaps coach Winstead on the proper stage presence.) The problem is that the bad comedy hurts most of the rest of the film as well. Because her humor is so flat, I have trouble telling when she’s joking around in her interactions off the stage. I’ve seen many comedians who mask trauma and pain with humor, but it never feels like Nina is doing that, because she is so forthright in all her interactions it never feels like a joke. It’s so bad that, when the climax hit, it took me a little time to realize this was supposed to be a dramatic scene and not more of her dark attempts at humor. I kind of saw this big reveal coming, because it seemed so obvious that she was dealing with something like this, based on her behavior up to that point. While it’s certainly a devastating series of events, it didn’t elicit an emotional reaction from me. I’ll also mention that Common is a mediocre actor and doesn’t make for a likable love interest, which is one more detriment to All About Nina. I could see this being a powerful story, and one that would be heart-breaking to watch, but the writing and casting sunk it before it ever got off the ground.

6758,1. Take one of the most fascinating people on earth 2. Make a dull documentary about them,0
6759,A mess of a movie. The director doesn't even identify who is speaking so other than Grace herself you have no idea who she's interacting with. And the film meanders all over the place and drags whenever it's not showing concert footage. Very disappointing.,0
6760,I’m glad I had a free ticket. Not sure what I learned from this. ,0
6761,"Having been an avid fan since the 80’s this gem of an historic film not only allowed me to re-live the concerts I attended but also filled in so many blanks. You must see it if you want to understand the roots she drew upon to deliver the iconic performances we loved, and her respect for her fans.",1
6762,"As a concert film, this offering works well. But, as a documentary about its subject, it comes up lacking, presenting only smatterings of insight into what makes Grace Jones the person and artist she is. What's more, the film feels padded, including considerable incidental (and largely insignificant) material to fill out its runtime, which is, in itself, overlong and in need of editing.

I would recommend this film, particularly to fans of (family-friendly) anime.",1

For a first movie, Studio Ponoc started extremely well! All comparisons with Kiki's Delivery Service don't make sense, they only have one thing in common: both protagonists are witches. The supporting characters aren't well introduced, but their development is surprisingly good, the story is original and I loved the university, that place is almost a Taj Mahal. It's a drcent start and unfortunately we still don't have informations about Studio Ponoc's future projects!",1

6771,Love this movie it beautiful and entertaining,1
6772,Reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's best movies.  My 11 year old son and I really enjoyed this one.,1
6773,"Magical charm with wondrous animation.

Hiromasa Yonebayashi's imaginative anime fantasy adventure Mary and the Witch's Flower (2017) wears its influences on its sleeve with a comforting warmth all its own. I can see the clear influence that Hayao Miyazaki has had on Yonebayashi with Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle in all the tender references and cute concepts within the effervescent Mary and the Witch's Flower.

Yonebayashi takes many ideas and recontextualizes them into a new and delightful story from author Mary Stewart from her novel ""The Little Broomstick."" I think Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Riko Sakaguchi's writing empathizes with the playful innocence of children and desperation for reprieve from boredom. I love the theme of loving yourself for who you are, not aspiring to be someone else instead.

Yonebayashi's direction is whimsical, silly, and fun with an endearing sympathy for bored little girls looking for Summer wonders. Hiromasa Yonebayashi impressed me again with his dreamy little odyssey into magical encounters with Mary and the Witch's Flower. I adored When Marnie Was There and The Secret World of Arrietty has grown on me. Mary and the Witch's Flower fits nicely in these forest filled features with dazzling hand drawn animation from Studio Ponoc.

 Yonebayashi is not yet as original as Hayao Miyazaki, but he's got a directorial style all his own. He completely understands how imperative hand drawn animation is for the conservation of anime and film. His latest animated picture Mary and the Witch's Flower is as cozy and playful as any Studio Ghibli classic. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Toshihiko Kojima's editing is excellent as Kojima allows for a gently guided pace into a fantastical adventure with a gradually quickening pace. Mary and the Witch's Flower never overstays its welcome at an easily watchable 103 minutes. Tooru Fukushi's cinematography finds unusual angles and perspectives with his camera choices. Bird's eye views into far wide shots or intimate close-ups are all over Mary and the Witch's Flower enthralling animated visuals. All the colors and designs pop with a sense of majesty to everything. 

Takatsugu Muramatsu's massive score sweeps you off your feet like a broom soaring with you throughout the vast sky. The large swells of symphonic bliss lighten Mary and the Witch's Flower's tone with a natural sweetness. Muramatsu's music is captivating and uplifting like his dreamy score for Hiromasa Yonebayashi's previous feature film When Marnie Was There.

The English Dub's voice cast for Mary and the Witch's Flower is quite fun. Ruby Barnhill is very engaging and endearing as Mary Smith, a young girl who stumbles into witchcraft. Barnhill's cute British accent helps you imagine Mary as a relatable girl. Kate Winslet's voice acting for Madam Mumblechook sounds great with her posh elegance and sudden fury working well together. Jim Broadbent's stuffy English accent and manic voice acting are excellent as Doctor Dee.

Lynda Baron sounds so kind and gentle as Mary's elderly great aunt Charlotte. I loved the powerful confidence and mystique that Teresa Gallagher gives to the young witch Charlotte. Ewen Bremner gets lots of laughs as the fastidious broomstick caretaker Flanagan with his heavy Scottish accent.

Overall, I loved Mary and the Witch's Flower. It's another phenomenal film from Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Studio Ponoc. I look forward to his next anime picture.",1
6774,"A terrrific, offbeat movie that teases out issues of art vs. reality, emotional reality, mental illness, courage, and classic ""coming of age"" themes, treated unconventionally, but very expressively through dance, hallucinatory passages, and exceptional acting.  The performance by the young Helena Howard reveals a new and exciting talent.
The movie is also a good warm-up for Decker's more recent work in ""Shirley"" - which is also strange, evocative, and excellent.",1

6776,"So pretentious with far too much style over substance. This film seemed way more concerned with being cool and painting pretty pictures through a series of Instagram filter style shots rather than telling a story. A shame because the subject is interesting, just wasn't realistic and left me feeling cold and ultimately bored.",0
6777,"Madeline's Madeline is a messy, infuriating film that never satisfies in any way at all. I don't like using the word pretentious to describe a film, but sadly I feel it is apt here. I can clearly see it as an artistic statement, but as a form of entertainment it is severely lacking. Madeline is a young student who is performing in an impressionistic play group. Her teacher is striving for things very unique. At the same time she has a poor relationship with her mother. I wish I could say more about the story but there really isn't much of one. It just lurches from scene to scene of basically nonsense. I can't really recommend this film at all.",0
6778,"Decker's usual directing style and artsy-fartsy mannerisms become organic for a story about mental illness, making us share the character's dissociation, but the film is sadly uneven, with almost as many brilliant moments as obvious ones and not really going anywhere in the end.",0

While this might seem like a recipe for a simple coming-of-age drama, it is a fervently experimental project. A seemingly more realistic rendering of Black Swan or Birdman's blurred lines between reality and performance, Madelineâ(TM)s Madeline confines its more surrealist approaches to its narrative, editing and cinematography as a way of depicting Madeline's discordant emotional state.

The odd art-world theatrics and jarring cinematic approach of Madelineâ(TM)s Madeline recall the distinctive character of Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) and Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) along with the indie eccentricities of Lenny Abrahamson's Frank and Leos Carax's Holy Motors. As such, the unconventional conceptual tact in which Josephine Decker handles Madelineâ(TM)s Madeline strongly encapsulates its character's disorientation. While not initially apparent due to its seeming lack of focus, it slowly sharpens its gaze into a satisfying view of Madeline's personal limbo.",0

6783,"It's not difficult to see and appreciate the intent of director Josephine Decker's Madeline's Madeline, an artsy, indie movie about artsy, indie people, but it is difficult to become immersed in their world when the message about the process and the craft-no matter how vital the performances or justified the feelings-fails to be intriguing to anyone beyond this realm.

I love to write, I love the creative process, and while acting terrifies me I find a person's ability to give themselves over to the confidence it takes to embody something other than who they're already trying to work up the confidence to embody completely admirable. And yet, Helena Howard's titular Madeline never comes off as a performer authentic in her love of the craft, but more a young and impressionable soul struck by the mystic intangibility of what being an actor means.

Madeline's Madeline tries its damnedest to sidestep ones expectations of any kind of formula within its filmmaking, but in the process of avoiding such trademarks it forgets to create one of its own that both demystifies and enlightens the audience as to why they should care as much about the method as they should the final, prepared version presented on screen. In other words, I just didn't get it.",0
6784,"This is a subtle film. It takes a little while to focus on who is clearly the child of primary focus, character wise (the teacher aside). I really rate Maggie Gyllenhaal as an actress - she is quite expressive and it shows that she cares for and truly wants to encourage the child's creative talent. I should point out that there is more going on than first seems but I won't elaborate, obviously so as not to provide any spoilers of course.

However, there is also a darker side that is suggested at times and that made me curious to find out more about the childs family/background. The music played (mostly stringed instruments) gives it a slightly spooky and sort of claustrophobic angle as well.

There is some poignant dialogue and I thought this film was well made, hence I'd recommend it - the only downside I felt was that there are unanswered questions by the end, which may frustrate you.",1

6791,"Spoilers: This has the kind of courage in Maggie that we saw in Kevin Bacon in 2004's ""The Woodsman."" Child molester Kevin out of prison is still wrestling with: Why am I this way? --- and struggling to walk the straight and narrow. Maggie's transgression of child abuse is not sexual but something more about how she is, a kindergarten teacher, who seems to be a real pro until she meets a 5-year-old who writes poetry she likens to the kind of music Mozart was doing as a tot -- that exceptionally talented, and dealing with the lack of enthusiasm by the kid's family in nurturing the talent. But besides watching an immensely skilled Maggie work her craft meticulously, we see a woman thoughtful, frustrated, angry, jaded, in a state of either ennui or desperation. Described as an aging hippie by her kids, she is not averse to iconoclasm, as she has a sexual encounter with her poetry teacher, and she can be both hard-charging and unforgiving. But we cringe a lot for her, seeing where this piece is going, as she is an idealistic woman gone out of touch, due to her inability to adjust to the bumps along the road, and with 3 teen kids who no longer need her and a less than stimulating husband. She idealizes the talent in this boy, even is a bit jealous because her own poetry is hardly commendable, and in a final burst, tells the kid he soon will be worn down, his talent erased, and instead, she will take him from New York to Canada, after surreptitiously removing him from the new school his Dad put him in to avoid her. Ironically, the kid's biggest prodigy act turns out to be calling the cops on her. This is at once a plea for societal nurturing of children in an optimum way to develop their talent, which all have of one kind or another, into skill, and the downfall of a sensitive, soft-spoken educator beaten down by systems in and out of school, who breaks under the strain of doing what is best for one special kid who doesn't get the right kind of nurturing. But her myopic focus on the kid and on the true, the good, the beautiful, makes her step way out of the bounds of both her lifestyle and society's mores and laws, as she could lose family, job, freedom. Maybe both movies are making the hard case that all of us need some sympathy, even pedophiles and child abductors -- as the Stones put it, some sympathy for the devil? -- and also as studies of two individuals, as we may understand them a little better, though we are still disgusted by the destructive lengths they have gone to. Maggie here may be mourning more for her own missed fulfillment of potential than the kid's. But in a societal view, maybe this does help us see another aspect of what people are and  can be and can face, what pressures they are under, how they can break as the pressure builds, as we are more vulnerable than we care to admit. That film art, at best, could lead to some thoughtful ways of moving toward healthier individuals and a healthier society writ large.  Maggie steps up big time yet again, as actor and producer. I had to see the 2014 Israeli version, and have to say Maggie's is better in many ways, better written and acted and filmed, more nuanced and coherent.",1

Second, her music is not my style (not hip-hop in general, which look to me not rich in anything but in rhythm, and that is way a great mass can feel identify with it, because they can do at home). But their songs are strong, they are easy to like, and she has -independently of aesthetics- a overwhelming personality, which also helps to the documentary.

But, of course, the important point about the film is that the main character does not forget about her roots and uses her platform to give a message about her country, something that is not very common in music world and, of course, she is criticized.

The story was all over the place. At first it seemed like the girlfriend was supposed to be Adam's counterbalance (I thought it was hilarious when her jaw dropped at the down syndrome joke), but then she was diminished to just an SJW persona, and then she wanted nothing to do with him. Then Adam lashed out at Oz, and then Oz wanted nothing to do with him. And then Adam got socked in the face by Dizaster who immediately forgave him, declared him the winner, and hugged him... all accompanied by slowmo confetti, a cheering crowd, and epic/cheerful music, all extremely undeserved.

BUT I have an MA in philosophy, specializing in most recent cultural problems, so I feel entitled to have a say in such topics and to really get them and to be right whenever I talk about them. I am joking, of course, but there is something to it, because I laughed really hard on this movie (diner scene with its absolute misunderstanding of what racism it and even how to define it is hilarious to a philosophy adept) and, what is more, I found some of its observations of how racial discourse in USA unnecessarily becomes more and more convoluted and misses the point from the both sides very apt and timely. Oh, and the rap battles are cool too - and the final one(‘s) bring it to a whole other level.

6836,"As a longtime superfan, this movie quenched my thirst for more footage of Gilda, but it lacked depth in some important areas.  I would've liked to know more about her relationship with her mom, who fed her Dexedrine to lose weight at age 10 & handed her off to a nanny to serve as her mother figure.  She suffered from ""every eating disorder known to man"" from the age of 9 to 35, yet this part is only touched on briefly in the film.  And the illegal abortion that rendered her infertile was skimmed over in one sentence.  Did she ever partake in any substances backstage at SNL with her cast mates?  Don't know.  The documentary doesn't say.

But the part that was most neglected was the 10 months leading up to her cancer diagnosis.  This is the crucial period because it ultimately led to her demise.  Gilda fought to have her symptoms taken seriously, seeing doctor after doctor only to be patted on the head & told to ""relax"" as if she were merely a neurotic woman.  If she'd have been taken seriously from the beginning & given the proper tests, her life could've been saved...or at least significantly prolonged.  

I felt as if Gilda (and Gene) were screaming from the grave to include some basic ovarian cancer info in this doc, but not a single word was uttered about it.  Nothing that could help prevent another tragedy or encourage survivors.  

I get that it's a doc about Gilda the person and cancer was only a part of her journey, but it was a significant part.  She'd lost several family members to the disease & feared it all her life only to die of it at 42.  She even wrote a best-selling book about it.  So I felt it deserved more airtime than it got.

This coulda been a mom's declining mentally, Dad and grown kids deal with the sorrow, pain and memories, and all move on after saying oh well, a fuzzy Hallmark TV special. But it went so much further, and painted five portraits of people including assertive, stay-the-course Robert, losing-it Blythe and unhappy granddaughter and college student, or not, Taissa, giving this a whole family layer past that oldies decline. When Robert gave only-part-there Blythe the locket with the two of them young, and she said, ""I'm sorry,"" sorry she had slipped away, in a moment of lucidity, Robert gave an audible gasp and said, ""It's OK, honey,"" and they hugged, I fought mightily to keep tears in my eyes from rolling down my cheeks, and I'm an old guy. When the stunner of who died first occurs, other big family changes occur. Hilary decides to follow her heart and drop the hubby and bring Mom from Chicago out to California, giving Michael a break from holding hands and running errands. The siblings go from reminiscing to laughing to arguing. Dad, Robert, ever the demanding hard charger, kids take the brunt, won't budge from keeping Mom home even though she likes to walk off in the snow in her robe -- until he does budge. Granddaughter Taissa, Hilary's kid, is alienated from Mom and Dad and college, but bends to go back. Dad and son make up a bit over Michael's award winning Manhattan at his bar.

Of course, it helps when you have such a who's who of heavy hitters like ""What They Had"" does. Swank, Shannon, Danner, Forster & Farmiga all act their proverbial asses off and it's quite the feat to behold. Further, as far as writer/directorial debuts are concerned, Elizabeth Chomko can most certainly hold her head high in light of this effort. It's a well-realized narrative from top to bottom, with the last act really delivering on the expected emotionality in a truly effective manner. There are even a few shots and creative choices made that end up lending themselves to the impact of certain scenes or thematic ideas. The Chicago setting, for this viewer in particular, was also a welcomed personal touch. Definitely would recommend this one.",1

For the most part, I just told you the basic structure of 98% of the episodes of VH-1's popular series ""Behind the Music"".  With that being said that does not mean such documentaries are bad.  ""Whitney"" is one of the better documentaries of its type.  I think the film does a good job of trying to get to the root causes of the late Whitney Houston's problems which ultimately lead to her untimely and tragic death in 2012.  The interviews with family members and close friends are well done also and help give the audience an insight to the troubled singer's life and times.  The fact that Whitney's daughter, her only child, died under tragically similar circumstances makes this story even more sad.

6872,"This movie is awesome. Really creative. Give it time because it starts off kind of like a documentary (which I almost turned it off), but then it turns more into a cinematic experience. Brilliant concept, great acting, beautifully shot. This is a director to keep your eye on and a movie worth seeing. It inverts the concept of exploitation, by portraying a botched heist and it doesn't align with it's own characters. it nearly pities them. It's a really unique approach that I don't think I've seen before. Even the pulpier aspects carried weight. Had some heart-pounding moments without using any of the expected genres tropes.",1
6873,"A mocking, cynical and depressing film with a story that is neither fun or needed telling. This does not deserve to be in the heist movie conversation.",0
6874,"I must say, this is a different kind of heist movie. It's not an Oceans 11, or any of those films that treat a robbery as something glamorous and have you rooting for the robbers. This is about four college kids who decide to rob a university library for several extremely rare books. The film goes back and forth between actors plotting and then pulling off the heist, and the real participants, reminiscing on what they had done. A very powerful and thought-provoking movie. Kudos to everyone involved!",1
6875,Quite well done entertaining. The casting for the four college students was right on. The interspersing between the movie and the real people added a lot to the accuracy and believability of the film. Can't believe these kids thought they'd get away with it! And they made such stupid mistakes!,1
6876,"Great flick. A, mostly true story",1
6877,"It was interesting that the people involved are interviewed in between scenes of the reconstruction of what happened and also, more generally, that what happened took place in a college library, as I'm not sure I've seen such a heist/crime film set in a college library before. It also explains what happened to the main characters at the end of the film (its based on, I believe, a true story) and at the start of the credits rolling at the end, we're shown some of the detailed paintings from the texts that were targeted in the heist the film is about, which I also found interesting.

Some of the dialogue/script is pretty witty and thought provoking and I thought it was an entertaining watch, so I'd give this a 7/10 rating. Yes I'd recommend the film.",1

6886,"It is so discouraging to watch the amazing first Wreck-it-Ralph film and remember just how overbearing and disjointed the sequel is. There's barely anything to hold on to here. These lovable and well-fleshed-out characters are turned into stupified memable versions of themselves. 

Just four years later, a lot of the references and memes that the movie is counting on to make the audience laugh like well-trained lab monkeys are utterly outdated. What a boring waste of time. The ending is touching for sure but had I not loved Ralph and Vanellope deeply in the first film, I would not be feeling much emotion at that point either. 

Total failure with great already set-up easy-to-root-for characters.",0
6887,"It's not bad, but it lacks a lot of the charm of the first one. It's more about the internet than video games, so it loses some points right out the gate for me. Felix and Calhoun are given a bland story that feels like it's there just to have them do something. Alfred Molina's Double Dan character honestly feels out of place and should belong in another film entirely. The ending really goes off the rails and gets too crazy for its own good. That's not to say it doesn't have some great moments though. The scenes with Vanellope interacting with all the Disney princesses are very memorable. It just seems odd that they end up being an integral part of the finale. Alan Tudyk's KnowsMore character was good. It just felt like the script needed some more tweaks to get it to where it should have been. Again, it's not a bad movie, it just feels a bit disorganized and chaotic.",0

Ralph Breaks the Internet is ""Emoji Movie"" levels of bad, and might be the worst thing Disney has put to film since their most infamous direct-to-video sequels of the 90's and early 00's.

I say that as its re-assuring that there were/are journalists prepared to speak up about things the government had tried to hide from the public. I liked that it also focussed on Meryl Streeps character, Kay Graham, being the first American female newspaper publisher - the fact being that in previous generations, men would always be assumed to take up such high job roles. Of course these days, the themes covered in this film, the freedom of speech allowed to the printed press among other things, are very relevant, it could be argued that its more relevant now than in the past and so this film is certainly thought provoking and well worth a watch, with solid performances from both Tom Hanks as the editor and Meryl Streep.

It shows how Neil Armstrong was able to manage and overcome tragedy in his personal life and near death experiences in his professional life.  It also shows that he was not perfect, but he was an extraordinary man and great example for all of us on how to overcome life's challenges.",1

6929,"The 141-minute biopic about Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) can stall at times, but, after a few days contemplation, it does scratch the Space Age itch. Don't come to First Man expecting much commentary or visuals concerning the culture at large. This is an insider's film. The nuts-and-bolts of NASA, Astronauts, and Armstrong as the soft-spoken, modest man he was. The unsteady cam of non-space/space training scenes was a turn-off. I'm not sure if it mellowed or if I just became accustomed to it during the long run-time. Where the film excels are the training sessions — claustrophobic and prolonged — and, expectedly, the successful Apollo 11 mission. Although you know it's comin', Gotdamn does that line still give you chills.",1
6930,"This is quite an insightful watch. I certainly felt more informed about Neil Armstrongs life, in terms of his personal background, having seen the film and I thought that Ryan Gosling gave a pretty good performance in the main role. he was quite a sort of distant person, in more ways than one but I could understand that, from his perspective. The visual effects aren't too bad either. Some of the dialogue was a little muffled and hard to follow fully, which was frustrating, although I guess its somewhat fair to distinguish between the smaller talk during down time and the loud, edge of your seat moments when things are clearly precarious. As an insightful biopic its good but it certainly didn't grab me or keep me engrossed in the way that other such films manage to, thats what I thought.

Overall, however, yes; I would recommend this film, if you'd like to know a bit more about the Armstrong family.",1

Alonso is a gem. This movie is a gem.

I was expecting a pretentious piece about cultural appropriation and instead, I found a very entertaining story that also manages to beautifully portray the relationship of the Mexican people (and any third-world country citizen for that matter, the theme is universal) with their culture.

Ruizpalacios has several interesting surprises in his story. Some, such as Leticia BrÃ (C)dice's quasi-cameo, are very gratifying. Others, as a couple of meta-moments that wanted to mean something that I didn't quite understand, can be confusing.

But in general, this is one of the films with more personality of 2018.

6951,"Happy As Lazzaro – The Smell Of A Good Man
Tuscan-born writer/director Alice Rohrwacher has created an Award-winning allegorical observation on how the average person stumbles along, following the ruling classes orders of the day. Most live without stopping to analyze the derogatory impact, this almost hidden manipulation, has on our everyday understanding of the true meaning of life. Curiously, the writer based part of this strange story on a factual newspaper story! The manipulation of the poorer classes by greedy conglomerates - fleecing workers for a pittance in return for endless hard labor. How empty modern lifestyles can offer little more benefits than those of the slave workers, too often pushing the good in humanity to obscurity.  
 
It's not a film for everyone and many viewers may miss important messages within this thoughtful work – perhaps one reason could be because they blindly accept the hidden economic controls, enforced on the world's working classes. ‘Lazzaro' is both enigmatic and silently devastating to any viewer prepared to consider how the world's bankers – pervade every aspect of modern life - often reducing it to rubble for struggling nations.  It's little coincidence this film comes to its haunting conclusion inside a bank! 

 It's a longish tale (2 hrs) so needing a patient, discerning audience. It could possibly have conveyed its thoughtful message in less time but those attuned to reading between the lines of our everyday news media - will be quite willing to take the journey. Fascinatingly the filmmaker is able to convince the viewer to accept quite jarring, bizarre twists, as if we trust somehow they are taking us towards a meaningful outcome.  Sought after French cinematographer Hélène Louvart provides the darkly probing visuals. There is an interesting piano soliloquy that plays out here and there but the film has no score composer. Performances are uniformly good, making this a treat for those who like to think about their entertainment – the sensitive viewer might find the final scene one not easily forgotten (aided by a Wolf and some Italian folklore)",1

As a kid the only thing I knew about opera was what I learned in music appreciation in high school and that was ""Carmen"" and ""Madame Butterfly"". I, also, went on a school trip to the 'Old Met' plus let's not forget Mario Lanza as Caruso or Jeanette McDonald and Nelson Eddy.

In the 1950s I was very much into theatre, both musicals and plays, plus concerts, pop and Bernstein, movies, television was becoming very popular and the name Maria Callas started to appear in papers, magazines, interview shows on television but mainly became known as a prima donna first in a good way than as a sneer. She was a married woman having an affair with a Greek millionaire who would eventually leave her for Jackie Kennedy after the United States President died.

In ""Maria by Callas"" Maria Callas tells her story in her words, pictures, events and we hear her voice at its best, though recordings 50-60 years ago weren't as clear as they are today. We see her being mobbed by fans, the press, notable people like Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Taylor, Bridgette Bardot, interviewed by Edward R. Murrow, David Frost and Barbara Walters. She talks about how and why performances were missed and how, as a woman, she had to choose between her career and having a family, her feuds with her mother and the Met Opera director Rudolph Bing.

Whether playing the Diva or the rejected lover the main things that stand out about Maria Callas are her wide, open black eyes, thin body and, yes, that glorious voice. I won't pretend I know bel canto technique from a soaring soprano or other voices but I can be moved and I was by many of the arias she sings in this documentary.

""Maria by Callas"" presents a woman, a singer, many of us may have only known by the headlines or a gay icon but who deservedly was called 'the' female opera singer of the twentieth century. It also makes me realize what I missed not seeing her perform on stage.",1

Getting a full picture of a complex person in many ways is hard and it's particularly well executed by documentarian Matt Tyrnauer.  Final Score:  7.7/10",1
6978,"Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood is a 2017 American documentary film about the life of Scotty Bowers, directed by Matt Tyrnauer.
This film was definitely an eye-opener, in several ways. While I enjoyed the historical footage and flashbacks, I thought that it spent too long in the present, focusing on Scotty's comparatively uninteresting current lifestyle.

6979,"Factual account of normal human relationships.  The only reason this film is remarkable is because ""Hollywood royalty"" are shown to be people, just like everyone else.  We all know all kinds of sexual practice exist in every city and every state in the union.  

Nothing is really surprising, except to people who have deliberately not paid attention to life.  The people who really object to this film are the judgmental people who believe they are better than the average person.  That this belief is a fallacy, rooted in jealousy, hostility, and a sense of grandeur is also not much of a surprise.  There are judgmental bigots in every nook and cranny of the country.  

This film does a great service by providing definite proof of what Bowers is communicating through use of dozens of contemporaries, plus photographic evidence.  Sometimes diaries even exist to augment the author's statements.

Never gratuitous or prurient, Bowers comes across much like anyone else.  He is a human being who took a different path because that path occurred in his life.  Most of us would consider this a great service, especially since this was not done for financial gain.  Many of us can agree with Bowers as he states his life is better for the experiences he had as a teenager.  A teenage boy is not endangered by sex; most all boys consider sex to be an advantage, even if coming from an ""adult"" two years older.  

A wonderful, fascinating look at the famous -- and what we find is what you'd expect.   It is human sexual experience, much like happens all around us every day no matter where we live.   ",1

6989,"Youth and Beauty were worth more than power, money, and celebrity to gain entry to Xanadu once passing the heavily guarded and out of control frustration of the angry street mob desperate and determined to dance in a disco that really had nothing else going for it then the consistent and persistent rejection of Studio54 wannabes who would never, not for one night of their pathetic lives, be given a wish to finally see what all the fuss was about.  Being admitted to Studio54 was no different than dancing at one of the proliferating discos benefiting from the fact that there were more cash friendly discothèque clients wasting time and not able to spend their disposable income gathering like a herd of mindless sheep occupying otherwise closed for business 54th Street from 10pm – 4am.  Xenon opened in another unoccupied Broadway theater with the exact same architectural model as Studio54, a clone of the universal destination to be admitted and experience, but Xenon's front door was not a mob scene,  but a polite acknowledgement by the doormen, a short wait as if there was a fire code restriction, and a cold admittance once a gaggle of the Young and the Beautiful would cackling as they migrated out of Xenon on their way to another disco as club hopping was a unique and entitled privilege when you are Young and Beautiful.  Xenon was more interested in bleeding the wallets of the wannabees than Studio54.  And with clubs the size and technical sophistication as Bonds, Hurrah, New York New York, Infinity, Regine's, Paradise Garage, Ice Palace 57, Les Mouche, the Fun House, and the ultimate in space and design, the Saint, charging annual memberships on top of heavy door fees, there were options. There was no need to feel like a pauper begging to be wrangled from the insipid crowd of zombies mindless of their lack of worth to the doormen of Studio54.  I saw the documentary artlessly named after the club, ‘Studio 54', in 2019, curious that a film crew would have gained access to the aloof crowd of celebrities not exactly exhibiting good public relations behavior, although the paparazzi was omnipresent to capture a film studio promotional still that would be sold, printed, and seen by the World to ensure the fanbase that their star looked chic and seemed to be in very good spirits.  Never let the public know you are Missing in Action.  Greta Garbo dissolved into the privacy that celebrities can't afford.  But the film didn't exhibit anything more than what the paparazzi's camera still shot.  I was disappointed, given that I was an 18 year old stripper/hustler at the Ziegfield of respectable homosexual theaters at that time: the Gaiety Burlesque, where I learned from street savvy colleagues how to dress, present, dance, and get complimentary entry to most clubs, Studio54 was no exception, as we were the perfect non-speaking extras who filled the background and just danced, not ogling or gossiping about a celebrity faux pas.  I saw a lot of ill behavior. We just danced like it was the only reason to be there.  I wrote about my introduction to New York society and charm school behavior in discotheques like Studio54 which when I realized the academic and professional opportunities I possessed, left the Gaiety, finished college, got a qualified boyfriend, and continued to go to the next new club on weekends to satisfy my addiction to disco and the culture that it thrived on: drugs, excessive hours dancing from Saturday to Sunday, obsessive about maintaining an unnecessarily overly developed physique, and to always feel like you were the object of someone's unrequited desire.  A harsh world. Without stating the title, it is a cautionary tale of the  possible extinction of the species ‘homosapiens', as the movie ‘Studio54' sadly ends with the party and its participants over and done with those halcyon nights.  Those that survived, with the exception of successful entrepreneur Ian Schrager, are not, and probably chose not to be interviewed for their participation in a short-lived fairytale euphoria.  Bianca Jagger was a spectacle of a beautiful mess looking at her sorry face in the public restroom in 1978. Today, she lives far away figuratively and physically from the tiny theater that was once ‘Studio54'.",0

6991,"I didn't grow up in the Studio 54 era, so the documentary, for me, told from talking heads who were there was informative, albeit not very hard hitting.  I wanted to know more about the drugs and the debauchery, but documentarian Matt Tyrnauer just scratches the surface of what could have been hard hitting and lots of fun.  The people who are living will take a lot of the tales to their grave or just tell in small groups.  I know there are better stories out there about the wild times at Studio 54 so why hide them.  Overall this is a solid piece of film which is exactly what you'd expect from Tyrnauer.   Final Score 7.6/10",1
6992,"A nice romantic look back at the rise and fall of Studio and subsequently Steve and Ian.  This would be an interesting topic regardless who made it, but the fact that they got Ian and workers from Studio 54 is what really makes this doc shine.  I watched the movie 54 in theatres back when it came out, and I was a fan of it, but this doc is on a whole new level hearing it straight from Ian's mouth.  The fact that there was so much footage still from this hallowed place where celebrities could do whatever they want and still have the privacy of it not coming out, is really special.  It's a nice trip back to the '70s and in essence everything that defined the decade.",1
6993,"This film is a coming of age, adolescent teen based film set in NYC, about a group of girls in the skateboard community. It covers themes such as self identity, belonging and of course teenage rebellion. I thought the music used was quite good, it gives the film an edgier feel, without perhaps being relied on too much to make it feel actively overbearing as such. The cast do a good job - I thought it seemed quite realistic with the female characters being pretty frustrated and exasperated at times with the situations they find themselves in. 

Its a bit predictable or cliched in parts but it's not as bad as it potentially could have been, although I realise it won't appeal to everyone (some people may argue why should we care at all about somewhat bratty kids? etc.) but I thought it was at least somewhat immersive and not sugary sweet, disingenuous or anything like that. I suppose it's not especially great but it's certainly alright/fairly good and overall, yes I'd (maybe cautiously, as it won't interest everyone) recommend this film. Oh and I liked the tone of the final shot.",0
6994,"It's so hard to do something unique anymore, yet somehow Skate Kitchen taps into a sense of freedom, into a subsect of youth culture, into a feeling of wistfulness unlike almost anything I've seen before. While wildly different in subject matter, I liken Skate Kitchen to Cooper Raiff's 'Shithouse' and 'Cha Cha Real Smooth' in that they evoke such a strong feeling of familiarity and sense of place that it is so easy to forget you're watching a movie. Everything about Skate Kitchen feels authentic. The actors all are actually skate boarders and seem like they came to shoot in their  own clothes, own hair styling, etc. As a result, the acting from 1 or 2 of them is not as good as it could be had those characters been played by more established actors, but what it is so marvelous about the actors all actually skating is that the movie flows effortlessly from action shot to dialogue to drama and back again. All of the story focuses on Camille, and she is an incredibly relatable character for me. Just a fantastic movie.",1

Skate Kitchen is a joy. A well-observed rites of passage story, and refreshingly a female one.

At the beginning the dreamy, sunlight shots had me a little anxious. Was it going to be another fetish skateboard film. Fortunately, not as it becomes a more deeper, engrossing tale.

7005,"I nearly fell asleep watching this snoozer of a biopic.

Director Matthew Heineman's war drama biopic of Marie Colvin entitled A Private War (2018) is a terrible film. Rosamund Pike cannot save this movie to be honest. Heineman does not know what he wants to say as a message. I think he wants to honor Colvin's bravery as a war correspondent, but A Private War does the opposite as it demonstrates how she was a reckless fool, who dove head first into active combat zones only to lose an eye and ultimately her life. Her work was not actually all that important as war still rages on in The Middle East and she died for nothing. The film skips around various combat zones and says nothing with so much footage.

It's also a horrible portrayal of her character as she just smokes to the point of ruin, drinks to the point of alcoholism, sleeps around without care for attempting a real relationship, and selfishly risks the lives of those around her just to get her story. A Private War really feels like Marie Colvin was a shameless glory hog bound for oblivion. Rosamund Pike delivers a solid, transformative performance, but the script gives her little to work with, honestly. She feels deluded to the point of being a raving lunatic striving for death in the field. Pike is intense and thoughtful even when the film is not.

Writer Arash Amel delivers a fairly dull script that doesn't let you get to know Marie Colvin. You get nothing of her life or journalistic philosophy truly. It's all gossip and private conversations that does not get to the heart of her as a person. As a biopic, A Private War fails to get you to care about this idiotic reporter, nor is it a flattering depiction. When Colvin was not needlessly injecting herself into war zones out of some self-righteous sense of somehow changing the world and defining history. There's so much coverage of war scenes that it forgets the movie still needs its heroine. It's all unpleasant, uninformative, and boring. You get no context for the wars she is covering and learn nothing of any of these conflicts.

Editor Nick Fenton cuts back and forth so confusingly between Marie Colvin's home and war zones, that A Private War is always jarring. It's slowly paced. For only a 106 minutes movie, it feels like 3 hours. Robert Richardson's cinematography ranges from gorgeous with touching shots to bland and forgettable. Composer H. Scott Salinas' generic score is rather uninspired. With a more fierce score, A Private War might have engaged me a bit more.

In short, A Private War is hardly worth watching.",0
7006,"Based on the true story of Marie Colvin a war correspondent who's brazen fearlessness put her into incredibly dangerous situations all over the world.  Rosamund Pike plays Colvin and does a fantastic job of conveying the horror that she's been through during the times she is back from war.

7008,"Have often wondered what it was life was like for war correspondents, and this amply brought it to light ... and the gut.  Whatever her fatal errors, Marie Colvin stands in the first rank of heroic women, and Rosamund Pike's gripping performance did Colvin's story true justice.",1
7009,"A Private War escapes complete mediocrity through a committed performance by Pike and a decent examination of its themes and the grimy realism of war, even if its narrative fails to emerge victorious. The adapters crafted an anthology of fairly repetitive tales with intermediary and connected events holding little weight outside of the warzone action scenes, and no amount of Marie's voiceovers could realistically paper over the cracks. Jamie Dornan is the only supporting actor given anything substantive to show his talents, and he performs well enough. Hollander appears next often on screen, but occupies a stale and conventional role. Stanley Tucci appears in an enigmatic, bare bones role that reads as if someone somewhere really wanted to brag about having Stanley Tucci in their film. Criticism aside, some of the images and pieces of the script are impactful and Pike performs well.",0
7010,A set of good actors but the editing is somewhat messy and jumpy and overall the film gets lengthy.  Ms Pike is very good but one has a hard time actually liking her character as she or the character lacks emotion...maybe the way the character she plays actually was; but you just have a hard time feeling for the victims of war or for the journalists.,0
7011,"A Private War follows the life of Marie Colvin, one of the most celebrated war correspondents of modern times. Even after losing the sight in one eye after being hit with a grenade while reporting in Sri Lanka, she carried on travelling to the world's most dangerous war zones, putting her own life at great risk to give a voice to those who were suppressed under terrifying regimes.  Overtime her pursuit of the truth and exposing those who would seek to cover up their war crimes, she starts to see her personal life unravel as relationships fall apart and her every waking moment is haunted by the things she has seen and exposed to the world. 
A Private War is a superb biographical account of Colvin, stretching from the time she lost her eye in Sir Lanka to the moment she lost her life exposing the horrors that were occurring in the besieged Syrian city of Homs.  Rosamund Pike was excellent in the lead role, playing a woman struggling between bravery and bravado when attempting to expose the truth but also to live up to other's expectations of her as one of the best war correspondents in the world.  The story exposes snapshots of recent history that are not for the faint hearted with every brutal act being exposed on screen and witnessed the same time as Colvin.  A true and brutally honest film about an extraordinary woman.  Well worth seeing.",1
7012,"While documentary director Matthew Heineman upgraded his informational skilled experiences of tackling territorial conflicts smoothly into factual storytelling, Rosamond Pike's riveting performance in a more humanely appealing role not only just solidified her talents but also honorably emphasized Marie Colvin's representational brave legacy on confronting conflicts and historically exposing them in echoing deliveries of empathetic timeliness.

Lynne Ramsay's neo-noir nightmare of a film will not be for all tastes.  Highly stylized throughout, the movie is deliberately paced with plenty of long takes, a brooding music score, and some slick cinematography.  With only four features to her credit over a twenty-year period, Ramsay is by no means the most prolific director out there, but, despite her lack of productivity, she has already established herself as a talented auteur.  You Were Never Really Here is a solid addition to her slight but impressive body of work.",1

7019,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The two main characters don't speak.  There is no plot, and the ending is as bad as the ending of the ""Sopranos"".  Nothing to recommend about this one........ Strange flashbacks that add nothing to the story.",0
7020,"This is a tense, eery and claustrophobic watch, with a very mysterious and quite quiet main character who we, the viewer, are made to fear for numerous reasons. Its interesting the way that his flashbacks attempt to paint an idea of his background to us. Its also a very urban film, with most scenes set not in a specific building or area set in quite dark city streets/roads and the like.

The use of old music played at certain moments certainly, I felt, added to the sinister, unsettling feeling. I felt that Joaquin Phoenix gave a very good performance as Joe, the main character. He plays the mean and moody type quite well. Also memorable was Judith Roberts as Joe's (unnamed) mother - a somewhat fragile old lady that he, if but reluctantly, cares for. 

When music tracks aren't played but there are sounds in the background, their the sort of spine-tingling instrumental type tunes you may associate with films by Alfred Hitchcock and the like, which highlights the sense of looming, of something being impending.

This is undoubtedly an atmospheric watch - its all about wondering what we're not shown, rather than what we are, a bit like found footage films, only we're not forced to view everything from amateurish camcorder footage. Elements of the film came across like sort of multiple nightmares - the violence is mostly implied rather than explicitly shown, although some blood is clearly visible at times.

If you've seen any of Lynne Ramsay's other films then you'll have a rough idea what to expect. I'd recommend this film.",1
7021,Phoenix's strong performance and the brutal moments of violence are lost in a flimsy story and unfocused direction.,0
7022,"Amazing acting by Pheonix - the plot and storyline was a yawn. Pheonix keeps you on the edge of your seat to see how he will react next, but it's a railroad into the madness he has lived. The end really sucked though - they took this ultra gut-wrenching, high intensity, over-the-top raw, emotional stuff and had the bad guy hero just walk into the sunset at the end with ""Come on Joe, it's a beautiful day outside.""

Honestly, a super depressing story with a let down at the end - the name doesn't make sense for the film, except that I wish I was never really here to see it. I want my 2 hours back.",0

7054,"THE GREAT ASHBY - My Review of HAL (3 1/2 Stars)
The very fertile 1970s brought us seminal work from Francis Ford Coppola, Terrence Malick, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Michael Cimino, Peter Bogdanovich, George Roy Hill, Stanley Kubrick, Milos Foreman, Norman Jewison, Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin, Igmar Bergman, Luis Buñuel, François Truffaut, and yes, Woody Allen, among many others.  No accounting of that period would feel complete without mentioning Hal Ashby, with this stunning run of films:  HAROLD AND MAUDE, THE LAST DETAIL, SHAMPOO, BOUND FOR GLORY, COMING HOME, and BEING THERE.  First time Director, Amy Scott, who has enjoyed a prior career as an editor has clearly fashioned HAL as a love letter to this one-of-a-kind filmmaker, which may only please fans, but you'd have to literally be dead to not appreciate his work.  
Born in Utah in 1929 and dying way too young at age 59 in 1988, Hal Ashby began his career as an editor himself, winning his sole Oscar for his work on Norman Jewison's IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.  Their friendship proves to be the biggest and most heart-warming surprise of this documentary, with Jewison's emotionally charged recollections of their clearly blissful relationship.  Their letters back and forth to each other have a funny and sweet tenderness, and Jewison helped launch him as a director with his first feature, THE LANDLORD.  Rather than direct it himself, Jewison, in a rare showing of generosity in this hellhole of a town, gave the film to his buddy.  It's clear that Ashby, the ultimate bearded, weed-smoking hippie that he was, had a distinctive voice even from his first film.  Ashby's style brought out equal amounts of absurdity, social commentary, rebelliousness, and heart, which admittedly makes for strange bedfellows with the aforementioned.  Yet, there it was, an unlikely mixture of tones which produced classic after classic.  
Thanks to a generous amount of recordings of Ashby as well as interviews with his colleagues and admirers, HAL captures the modest maverick that he was while celebrating a wonderful yet sadly short career.  Conspicuously absent from the mix, however, are Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and Bud Cort, the latter two seen only in footage from Ashby's funeral.  It's a shame since these actors did some of their best work with Ashby.  Still, it's great to hear from the likes of Jane Fonda, Jon Voight (whose current affiliations don't quite jibe with the anti-war sentiments he espoused as a character and as a proponent of his work in COMING HOME), Lee Grant, and Louis Gossett Jr.  Originally tapped to direct TOOTSIE, we're treated to some fascinatingly odd Dustin Hoffman screen tests.  Ashby is probably extremely grateful he didn't ultimately make that notoriously difficult film.  
I can't say that HAL is essential viewing.  It's truly a gift to fans, but his films?  E-S-S-E-N-T-I-A-L!!  Do yourself a favor and devour his 1970s films and then watch HAL.  Your life will feel complete.",1

The camera lingers on various pieces of modern art as different players are speaking, giving us the chance to decide for ourselves what we would bid for a specific piece of art. 

Are we all being hoodwinked by the glitz and wealth surrounding this crazy art scene? Are the collectors and critics under the spell of a type of cult? Watching Koontzï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM) rooftop monologue as he surveys one of his sculptures, one cant help but ask these questions. Representational artist West Frazier in a recent interview made the observation that important things are happening in the regional art scenes around the country, perhaps even more important than the lofty scene in New York. 

The representational artists such as Frazier sell their pieces for much more modest sums, and supplement their income by teaching workshops to the hobbyists and aspiring artists. These workshops frequently sell out well in

The movie possesses many wholesome moments & elevating jokes and it's inevitable to not fall in love with Harper throughout the movie. Nonetheless, although there are some instances where the movie stands out, it overall feels too familiar and nothing out of the world. In my opinion, I may deserve a little less than 92%.",0

Boring, trite and without a heart. And, I swear, this shouldn't even be classified as a rom-com. Or would you call a movie with 1 1/2 scenes of action an ""action movie""?


Also: Nice comparing the black man (one of the bosses) to a Gorilla. ""Even when he was being gentle, I could sense a possibility of strength in his touch. Kind of like when Koko was petting that tiny kitten"" A quote from the movie.

7075,"Set it up (B-)
All over the place with my feelings here. I really liked the film for the most part actually and it turned out to be quite a heartfelt comedy. The first 30 minutes of the movie confused me as to what genre they were playing into but as the movie goes on into the second and third act it gets a more specific genre tone of ""rom-com"". The two leads, Harper (played by Zoey Deutsch) and Charlie (played by Glen Powell) had good chemistry and I really liked seeing there cynical sense of humor come out. The focus on them being similar in job but different in personality was a fun idea and I enjoyed that Harper enjoyed more masculine things than Charlie as it flips the script on norms. The two funniest characters however were creepy tim (played by Titus Burgess) and Duncan (played by Pete Davidson). Any scene with either of these two minor characters had me laughing and I wish they both had so much more screentime. I thought the two boss characters of Richard and Kirsten were played to dumb and came off far too cartoonish. Richard gets into crazy temper tantrums that literally destroy property and Kirsten doesn't care at all about anyone around her..  these two are played to the point that they are very one dimensional and predictable. While I kind of knew what the ending was going to be from the beginning of the film, the route the story took to get there had me engaged and entertained. It could have been much better had they dialed down how over the top the bosses are and made the interactions with their characters feel more human. Felt like there were quite a few missed opportunities with this film to get more personal with it's audience and also to make the jokes feel more unique and authentic. Overall it is a good time and I would recommend to anyone who likes a lighthearted, cute, ROM com. Good date night film.",0
7076,"I thought it was a lovely, beautiful and absolutely wonderful film. I did know the premise of he story before watching so that probably affected my experience of the film in some way. Before watching I thought the idea sounded a bit tacky but it was actually done really well and wasn't too over the top strange like Nordic films can be sometimes. The film had a really quiet tone which I do like - helps one concentrate and be quiet oneself - with just a little bit of a soundtrack. It was also quite peaceful apart from the obvious exceptions. I did find the abattoir scenes distressing but in a way it was good education to see them. It was also very sad when she slit her wrist, the 'unexpected event' at the last minute of suicide is a bit cliche in films now but it was very powerful how she was sat there talking as normal on the phone whilst bleeding from her wrist. The characterisation was acceptable they were obviously both a bit odd which adds interest but Maria was a little irritating at times with her robotic emotionlessness and apart from her OCD, therapy sessions and super memory we didn't really find out anything about her. It was nice with that last scene of them together eating and she became more human but we were shown starkly how her OCD lingered which was kind of nice showing that we can all love and be loved no matter our flaws, strangeness and eccentricities. The plot was also a little thin which I guess is why they had those side stories like Sandor's difficulties with the boss and the police investigation but it didn't bother me too much. Some of the shots of them in their home were quite beautiful too. The film was wonderfully romantic and I really connected with it a lot, just that last shot with the forest fading to white and my heart felt so full, I was very happy to just sit and watch the credits play out and its been a while since I felt like that about a film, it left me in a good place. I loved and enjoyed the film even if it isn't anything really special or overly remarkable - a slightly reserved 7/10.",1
7077,"I'm not sure how a relatively slow paced film made 2 hours blow by in an instant, but On Body and Soul did it. The best thing about this movie was the performance of Alexandra Borbely.

The journey the characters take is fascinating, especially Borbely's character and ultimately, this film is one that'll leave a smile on my face for a while. If it looks like something you may even just slightly enjoy, you'll love it. And if it doesn't, you'll probably still like it too.",1

It is relatively slow in terms of plot pace but I thought it was quite contemplative, a good character based film and so I wasn't entirely bothered by the slowish plot pace.

We learn a fair bit about other people who work on the farmland and with the horses.

The sense of wilderness is quite sobering. Also the lack of dialogue at times made it seem quite poignant to me. Overall its an interesting, observation/character based drama which I enjoyed quite a lot.

Pour ma part, j'ai fait l'effort de poursuivre le film. L'intrigue politique casse le rythme sans arrêt. En 40 minutes de visionnage, aucune scène ne met en exergue le talent des acteurs, le scénario n'avance pas, la tension ne monte pas. Le son du film était très mal équilibré ; je passais mon temps à l'augmenter et à le baisser. 

La scène où deux personnages discutent dans la voiture, pendant près de dix minutes, sans que l'on voie leur visage – mais plutôt le pare-brise de la voiture qui roule dans la ville – a réussi à me faire abandonner le visionnage. Les Veuves, pourtant prometteur, est une vraie déception.",0

7138,"A poignant and poetic evocation of childhood

A remarkably contained and intimate story featuring only five main cast members, We the Animals is about a young boy awakening to his homosexuality. Equal parts lyricism and grittiness, the film looks at how the crystallising of one's perception of the world goes hand-in-hand with a loss of innocence. Less concerned with narrative beats and character arcs than with tone and visual poetry, the film operates in a similar magical realist key as Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012), whilst also calling to mind the Texas scenes of The Tree of Life (2011). And although the narrative could be accused of being a little insubstantial, this is an effective and poignant evocation of childhood.

Set in upstate New York in the 1990s, the film tells the story of nine-year-old Jonah (Evan Rosado), who lives with his Ma (Sheila Vand) and Paps (Raúl Castillo), and two slightly older brothers, Manny (Isaiah Kristian) and Joel (Josiah Gabriel). Existing just above the poverty line, the family is tightly-knit but dysfunctional, with Ma and Paps both prone to lashing out violently. When a neighbouring boy shows the brothers a porn movie, Jonah is taken aback when he reacts so strongly to a brief clip of two men having sex.

We the Animals is the fiction debut of Jeremiah Zagar, and was written for the screen by Zagar and Daniel Kitrosser, from Justin Torres's semi-autobiographical 2011 novel. Much like the novel, rather than presenting a classically structured plot, the film is instead composed of vignettes presented in a broadly chronological manner. Essentially a bildungsroman, the film covers some of the same thematic ground as Moonlight (2016), albeit it with a more esoteric tone. In a similar manner, although its depiction of the brothers' mischief recalls The Florida Project (2017), We the Animals is far more lyrical.

Initially the trio are presented as relatively indistinguishable from one another, but this begins to change as Jonah's self-awareness grows and he begins to withdraw from his siblings. At the same time, the voiceover narration becomes less frequent. Tied into this are the crayon pictures which he draws which change from innocent doodling to sexualised and violent images. Also important is how well Zagar uses the mise en scène to suggest psychology; as the film progresses, we see less of Jonah huddled under the bed covers with his brothers, and more of him alone under his bed. Zagar's documentarian background is also noticeable in his use of the techniques of cinéma vérité. 

In terms of focalisation, the film is tied rigidly to Jonah's perspective. In a general sense, this can be seen in the frequency with which cinematographer Zak Mulligan places the camera at Jonah's eye level. A more specific example involves a scene when Paps is arguing with another man off-camera; we can hear the voices, but not clearly, because neither can Jonah. Also important is that the film is shot on grainy Super 16, predominately with wide lenses and a shallow depth of field, robbing the image of sheen and depth, and thus foregrounding the impreciseness of memory, as if we are looking at events through gauze, half-remembered and half-embellished, as if there is no distinction between past and present, which reminded me a little of Mirror (1975) and Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988).

Thematically, although the film deals with domestic violence, Paps isn't the only one guilty of such behaviour; Ma is also shown as possessing a violent temper. Some of the dialogue also carries darker implications. For example, Ma tells Jonah that when children are 10, they leave their parents, asking him, ""promise me you'll stay mine forever."" When he asks how, she says, ""you're not 10, you're 9+1"". There's a beauty to this sentiment, but so too is there something unhealthy about it.

In terms of problems, for all its lyricism, the film never really says anything new, and it suffers in comparison to masterworks such as Tree of Life and Beasts of the Southern Wild. Another issue is that there is a sense that Zagar is more interested in lyricism than emotion; in trying to convey Jonah's interiority through abstract visual poetry, he neglects the issue of emotional realism. This should be a heartbreaking film, but it isn't, mainly because the characters exist primarily to facilitate philosophical musing, rather than as unique entities in themselves.

That aside, however, We the Animals is an impressive debut. Very much focused on the impressionistic and chaotic nature of memory, it depicts a young life yet to be fully formed, with its inconclusive ending reminding us that life doesn't have a three-act structure. And this might be the film's crowning achievement; in a story about the past and how we access it, the final impression with which it leaves us is that we can never know what lies in our future.",1

7148,"There are some funny bits, but how does this movie have such good reviews. The art style from the show still sucks, the characters are still one-note and annoying, and the plot is just boring. Too many of these scenes had me wanting them all to just shut up and end the movie already. I don't care if you want to sing that stupid song again.",0

7151,Sonic I think it's a weird thing about the man,1
7152,"I enjoyed this film, knowing its the last film Robert Redford intended to star in (certainly as the lead character). It somewhat reminded me of the Mule, I suppose as its a film about an older gentleman involved in potentially violent crime, although no doubt there are a lot of other such films around. There isn't actually a lot of violence in this film, its much more of a low key character based drama. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Forrest and Jewel acquainting themselves, there are some heart to hearts, interesting discussions that give an insight into Forrest's life perhaps. It's perhaps somewhat thought provoking in terms of how the authorities regard the recent robberies when they realise the culprit is an older man who is, as I say, regularly described as 'a gentleman', as if that could ever be the case(!) surely not(!).

I also like it as its based on a true story, which always appeals to me. I would certainly recommend this film, yes.",1
7153,"While it takes it's time and isn't loaded with action, the movie is exceptionally cast and beautifully shot, centered around the final performance of an actor that is a legend among legends.",1
7154,"I thought it was good overall and worth watching even when slow-moving at times, but I thought it left some loose ends in the story which was frustrating. It was also frustrating that Forest never seemed to learn from his past, even in his old age when he had things good and could have lived out his days happily with Jewel.",1
7155,"You'll never find a bigger Redford fan than me, but much like Eastwood and his squint, stringing out the double take Redford is famous for, it's very tired now. The romance thing just didn't work, he's 85 for Christ sake. Can't fault the acting, but hagiography gets tiresome pretty quickly.",0

7157,"The Old Man & The Gun is one of the most interesting movies I had ever seen. It's about an old time criminal who robbed banks. I love everything from this movie like the script, the direction and the performances of Robert Redford, Danny Glover and Sissy Spacek. It is also the last movie that Robert would ever perform because he wanted to retire. And he didn't disappointed me one bit in this movie. Overall, The Old Man & The Gun is a masterpiece.",1
7158,Beautifully played by the two leads and Casey Affleck brings his own screen presence to what is really a minor role. A film that doesn't try and explain why an intelligent and charming man would find himself unable to settle down but be forever drawn to the allure of robbing banks. He describes it not as 'making a living' but as 'living' - and yet a good portion of his life would have been spent languishing in prison.,1
7159,"'The Old Man and The Gun' is slow, bordering on tedious.   It is similar to the 1982 movie 'The Grey Fox', but without the charisma.  Not that it's a bad movie, it just doesn't have any real strengths.",0
7160,"They build a compelling character then avoid showing us any of the interesting parts of his life. Who makes a movie about the time John Mcclane went to the DMV? Apparently David Lowery. The film relies on star power not story. I guess this is supposed to appeal to an older demographic who want to see Robert Redford but don't want to see any action, or romance, or meaningful interpersonal communication that is hard to keep track of.",0

7179,"I think if you enjoyed this film, then you had to be on whatever it was that his wife was giving him. Anderson has made several great films. This is not one of them. This is a big pile of horse shit disguised as great art. There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, and Boogie Nights are fantastic films I can watch whenever they come on. This is not. This was two hours and ten minutes I will never get back. Thanks a lot.",0
7180,"I liked how soft spoken and thoughtful the main character, Reynolds, appears to be and the slow piano music played in the background of most scenes. I liked the settings, with some shots of old fashioned English towns. The dialogue felt somewhat poignant at times. While Reynolds seems quite a sensitive person, he isn't entirely likeable but I felt that the emotional performances between Vicky Krieps, who plays his partner, Alma and Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds seemed very believable and so its a relatively engrossing watch.  I found myself second guessing what may happen next, in terms of what direction their relationship may take. They come across as both quite vulnerable people in perhaps their own way and indeed both the instrumental music and the incidental music played lightly in the background highlighted this. I think fragility is a key theme in this film, with the link between the relationship and the soft and luxurious nature of the fabrics being the main obvious one. The main thing I liked about this film is its subtlety.

The film certainly depicts a dysfunctional relationship and I suppose it could be said to be rather (for some painfully) slow on plot but I liked the atmosphere and the general feel of it, the tenderness and so it worked for me.",1
7181,"You did it again PTA, it took me so long to see just because how could this subject matter be interesting? Let me tell you this thing was beautiful and intriguing. It takes all kinds at all times and this is such an interesting take on the subject matter.",1
7182,"This is a quite endearing anime film, with some lovely fantasy scenes, as are often present in anime films. I enjoyed the use and timing of piano music to accompany the main character rushing around at times. The colours used in the animation are quite light and cheery - it has a dreamy feel to it, which is common when it comes to anime films. The plot is one that I imagine the vast majority of children with siblings would be able to relate to, which is good. I also particularly liked the scenes towards the end, which feature decent integration between what appeared to be 2D and 3D/CGI animation. I certainly enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to others.",1
7183,"Mirai is definitely not going to be a movie for everyone. For starters, the main character of this film is a very bratty 4-year-old. The child can be extremely irritating to watch to the point of being unlikeable. It's worsen when everyone else is so nice and likeable, including the new baby sister.

However, that is the intention of the film. The whole focus of Mirai is seeing this bratty kid learn important life lessons and growing into a more capable individual and a better brother for the new sister. Fantasy elements such as seeing an anthropomorphic dog or a middle school age version of his sister are there to give him these lessons in more interesting ways. This leads to some amazing visuals and animation with some stellar sequences. Additionally, the music is great and elevates the scenes.

Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. It's not a movie with high-end stakes but it is a meaningful story that has a wonderful ending. I highly recommend giving Mirai a watch because it has a very beautiful message.",1
7184,"A cute story about a very young boy who learn to overcome his small everyday troubles (how to ride a bike, understanding his mother, accepting his little sister) by travelling through the past and future and meeting his family.",1
7185,Mirai is a film with beautiful animation and a lackluster story. The repetitive nature of the vignettes and the lack of any real stakes drag the film down despite the Herculean efforts of the animators.,0
7186,"A sweet and inventive animated journey full of empathy and good vibes that looks at modern family mechanics through the curious and dissatisfied eyes of a young child. Hosoda is, without a doubt, one of the great names in animation that still has a lot of joy to give.",1
7187,"Incredibly personal movie, on the topic Hosoda likes the most. Family. Struggles of the family, the meaning of it, importance of ancestry and understanding within the family. Those are all heartfelt and genuine bits sprinkled in this film. Unfortunately, I just can not help but point out, that Mamoru Hosoda had done this better. The repetitive nature of the narrative and prevalence of the magic realism, leave really no room for investment outside of seeing, what exactly any given time vignette is trying to teach Kun about how to be a better brother or son, only for it to be reset for the next conflict. Not to mention, visually it doesn't stand out, it is still the same minimalism, that he always used. But there is nothing interesting or compelling about it. Except maybe distracting CGI dog and house architecture.",0

7192,"This is a very insightful documentary into a Japanese artist, which has philosophical and cultural aspects to it. I wasn't aware of her work prior to seeing this but I enjoyed learning about her work and hearing her explain the context of some of her work. Its also interesting hearing her compare her own work to those of her contemporaries and frustrating the clearly sexist barriers that existed in terms of getting her work displayed and taken seriously.

This is a good documentary, if your interested in the subject area.",1
7193,i fell in love with kusama,1
7194,"Yayoi Kusama is one of my favorite artists. It was nice seeing this and it's a must see film for anyone wanting to know about Kusama. As a side note, one of my most valued possessions is a small Kusama art piece.",1
7195,"This documentary recounts the truly remarkable life and carrer of the acclaimed Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. At 89 years of age, Kusama has become the best selling female artist in the world. However, as the film will depict she has had to overcome a traumatic childhood, racism, misogynism, and mental illness, and even having her innovations ""ripped-off"" by other artists. No English subtitles unless accessed through remote control, and the ones that appear when Japanese are spoken are rather small and usually presented against a light background. Stay for the postscripts which contain some wonderful surprises.",0
7196,"This documentary is absolute revelation. Finnaly a portrayal that gets pass the point of focus  just on Kusama's psychologichal issues and obsession with dots. After watching this film I gained a new level of appreciation of her as an artist. Her absolute dedication and commitment to her work and believe that one can make this world better through art is ever so inspiring.
Congratulations to as equally dedicated director Heather Lenz on brinnging this film to life for us to enjoy.",1
7197,"Kusama is a trailblazer who defied all odds on her journey to become the top selling living female artist.  Seeing her treated so unfairly brought me to tears.  Ultimately the film is a very inspiring story of an artist who, despite being ahead of her time, figures out how to not only survive, but thrive.",1
7198,"Kusama Infinity is an extraordinary view into the life, mind & passion of trailblazer Yayoi Kusama. The filmmaker lets you experience Kusama's journey on an intimate level so much so that you truly feel the artist's emotions which leave the viewer feeling inspired & heartbroken at the same time. This film is a must see for any art lover or fan of documentaries or biopics.",1
7199,"Director Heather Lenz has created an important, timely, and fascinating film about the brilliant Yayoi Kusama, the now 89-year-old groundbreaking and only recently famous Japanese visual artist. In the early 1960s, Kusama escaped her stifling family to begin her career in New York, where she innovated--as Lenz's film reveals--only to have her concepts and techniques stolen by the likes of Warhol, Oldenburg, et al. These men soon eclipsed her celebrity, and at her expense. Hence Lenz's film is a very critical correction of the historical record. Lenz also locates the origins of some of Kusama's visual motifs in childhood trauma, which had resulted in hallucinations and then obsession with hallucinated shapes and patterns; Kusama herself acknowledges as much and credits art-making with her survival. Her mirrored ""infinity room"" installations, giant polka-dotted pumpkins, and huge paintings covered obsessively with her personal iconography, now draw massive crowds at museums and galleries all over the world. Heather Lenz has not only drawn a powerful portrait of an artist whose late fame has intense cultural significance, but has also set a humanistic standard for the accounting of biographical details and, critically, for setting the historical record straight.",1
7200,"Infinitely great. A thoughtful, compassionate and deeply profound look at one of the most influential and unsung artists of the modern era. The footage of Kusama is amazing and rare. Director Heather Lenz captures the eccentric essence of this fascinating figure, while also making a bigger statement about overlooked female artists and artists of color. This film demands to be seen because Kusama demands to be known.",1
7201,"Like a lot of people, I knew about Kusama from the colorful images that circulate on social media sites like Instagram. Although what I had seen of her art was intriguing, I didn't know anything about the woman behind the art. I had no idea how long and hard Kusama worked or how many obstacles she had to overcome to achieve the success that eluded her for so long. I highly recommend this movie that so sensitively portrays her story and corrects her place in history.",1
7202,I didn't really enjoy the style of this one as you're thrown into a story that bounces all over the place and you have no back story of what's going on or who the characters are. Some narration would have helped to make the flow of the story better.,0
7203,"Film coraggioso, tratto dall'omonimo romanzo, si dimostra un ottimo prodotto con peculiarità uniche.
La scelta di non tradurre la maggior parte dei dialoghi è precisa e clamorosamente riuscita, rende perfettamente il senso di smarrimento e di ansia a cui era sottoposto il protagonista.
Gli aspetti tecnici funzionano meravigliosamente; le sequenze di combattimento, gli ambienti della prigione e le dinamiche dei personaggi sono eseguite perfettamente; così come la fotografia.
Sicuramente il punto debole è il percorso del personaggio, che più che redenzione, trova una continua lotta interiore e contro gli altri, con brevissimi lampi di calma.
Azzeccata la scelta di prendere veri ex carcerati; in linea con il film, garantisce di migliorare ancora le ambientazioni e gli aspetti tecnici.",1
7204,"very difficult to watch at parts, but a quite accurate depiction of thai prisons from what i am to understand from documentaries and such. i was at first a bit peeved that they didn't include subtitles for the thai, but i realized that they added more and more of them as the protagonist learned how to understand it himself, which is a nice touch. the fight sequences were also scaled in this way : blurry and unclear at first, but more intense and focused as he learned to ~discipline himself. this movie is really great, but be warned that there is a lot of physical and sexual violence. i also liked their approach to the transgender women in the film, as it seemed they were respected and not stigmatized in any way.",1
7205,A grim reminder that it could always be worse.  Take your top ten list of things you don't want to do or experience in life and they are all likely in this movie.  Quite possibly the hardest movie I have ever seen.  I would've scored it higher but I can't recommend this to anyone and everyone.,1
7206,"This is definitely worth a watch if you like gritty realism. The touch of not having any subtitles (except for the parts where the Thais speak in heavily accented English) is clever and effective. I also liked that they explored some aspects of Thai culture like the ladyboys who work in the prison, and this is done in a non-patronising or sensationalising way. That sense of reportage hangs over the whole film in fact - I felt that the mood was 'This is Thailand - like it or lump it. This is Thai prison - if you're dumb enough to end up here, you're on your own.'
However, realism has its downside in that there really isn't much of a story to tell here, and the protagonist is rather unlikeable. This makes it hard to root for him, and his character is never really explored. Likewise, the numerous Thai characters felt to me like cardboard cut-outs that line the walls of each scene. The scenes involving the ladyboys also feel superficial and fleeting. The overall effect is that the film feels long and drawn out - it's 30 minutes too long, and the second half drags quite a bit. If they had explored the backstory of some of these characters it may have justified the nearly 2 hours.
It's possible that the real Billy Moore didn't put enough in the book about these subjects to be turned into script, and if so, it doesn't encourage me to read the book.",1
7207,"Poor Billy. I kept wondering if the book was good, the movie wasn't much to me even though I love the show 'most notorious prisons'. It was hard to watch, violent and gory and a bit boring.",0
7208,"A bit slow at some points. Very nice that it was based on a true story. That gives it that extra thrilling were for you don't want to quit watching. 
The prison is (I think) very realistic and frightening.",1
7209,It was decent. Not good nor bad!,0
7210,Watch with your soul..,1
7211,"I've heard critics complaining about how slow this movie moved along, but I think thats the point! It felt so real. Reality isn't as fast paced as a Mission Impossible movie; ""A Prayer Before Dawn"" presents its viewers with a must see true story. Excellent writing, acting, and all around execution.",1
7212,"This is an exceptionally well made film. Superb cinematography, acting and sound design. The graphic blood and gore in this is next level. My only objection is having to see a woman brutalised and objectified in order to be such a bad mofo on screen. The men also get brutalised (and one is objectified), but they didn't have to get raped first. It would be 5 stars otherwise.",1
7213,"It's payback, nothing else. It's also a miracle from that height, one after another. Can't you just leave her to death in the wilderness without food or water? Nice micro shot & neat tattoo haha...",1

7215,"Great brutal horror movie. A lot of violence, gore and great story with an amazing lead actor.",1
7216,"There's gore. And blood. So much blood. Do bodies have that much blood?! And by the end, you're on the edge of your couch, whooping every time you see her earring.",1
7217,"This was one of those films that Shudder used social media to shove down our throats. And you know what? It was totally worth it. Aside from a beautiful, colorful setting, the cinematography and acting were fantastic. Also, the blood kept coming, which made one person in this household happy.",1
7218,This is one of the greatest movies ever if you suspend your disbelief so the movie can happen.,1
7219,"Apart from some interesting cinematography choices, this long-winded 'revenge flick' doesn't add anything too special to the genre",0
7220,"Overall, the movie is an entertaining revenge story. I think the motivational plot point to kickstart her rage and anger against the bad guys should have been altered to a variety of other alternatives besides a sexual assault. Raped by a socially inept guy who thought he deserved some action from a woman just because she was dancing provocatively by the swimming pool the night before. Beyond this one story element that had me wondering why it was chosen instead of alternatives, the rest of the movie was horrifically fun.",1
7221,What is Tarantino was a woman?,1
7222,"This is a generally enjoyable watch. Its a bit cliched perhaps but its not too bad. I enjoyed the music played. Its a bit of a role reversal type watch as the child seems to have her head screwed on moreso than the dad but he means well. Its not an especially memorable film but its not bad either, so I'll give it a 3 star rating overall. The music is enjoyable and I felt nick Offerman did ok playing the father figure but its not the kind of film that leaps out to me as an 'I must own this' purchase.",0
7223,"Superb acting by the entire cast. The script is very well written, sharp, succinct and intelligent, with a very good understanding of the relationships between characters. The film handles some heavy topics in a beautifully understated manner. All music was performed live by the actors with no overdubs. A really good movie.",1
7224,I really enjoyed this one as the storyline was great on its own but the music with Kiersey & Nick makes it so much better and wishing there was more. I hope that there is a sequel so they can finish the storyline for all the characters.,1
7225,"Solid story, well acted, shot, and told.",1
7226,"Unfortunately, I found the film pretty forgettable. It didn’t elicit the emotion I hoped it would. The premise was set up so nicely. I wish the music was better too. It’s clear that Offerman offered his best, but the rest of the plot was oddly paced and didn’t come together. Not bad, just forgettable. Should have been better",0
7227,"My absolute favourite film of all time, it makes me cry, it makes me very happy, I love it so much",1
7228,This had such a good cast but the script was meh,0
7229,"May be pitifully sad yet understandably meaningful, this genuinely feel-good film delights with impeccable casting mainly Offerman and Clemons' father-daughter chemistry and talented singing that sweetly uplifts. (B+)",1
7230,"Plot is bland and predictable. The characters are boring and uninteresting. For a musical focused story, the songs are pretty atrocious. I understand people might feel connected and moved by the subject of their kids leaving to college, but this tale is pretty weak.",0
7231,"Hearts Beat Loud is nearly always an inch away from being overly adorable, but it somehow manages to stay within the boundaries of genuine feel-good territory for the entirety of its run time. The father-daughter relationship and dynamic is touching and is most often sold by Nick Offerman's quiet, but real, performance.",1
7232,"This movie has it all. Dark humor, pathos and hope. Well acted and incredibly written each story will hold your attention throughout the entire film. I didn't know what to make of the opening but Buster Scruggs sucked me in with his wit and hilarious dialog. The next episodes are more sombre and just as intriguing. Well worth watching.",1
7233,Amazing. Absolutely loved the entire film. First story is the best.,1
7234,Masterpiece! I loved all episodes.,1
7235,"Like many Coen brothers movies, the bleakness and cynicism is unflinching, but the filmmaking is so damn good, you can't stop watching. 

The cinematography is absolutely spectacular. This film needs to be watched on a big theater screen.

The segment with Tom Waits as a grizzled old prospector is one of the most perfect things I've ever seen on film. Unforgettable.",1
7236,"I'm a big fan of Westerns. I'm a big fan of Tom Waits. So there was no way I wasn't going to go out of my way to see this one. I really like it! The short story format was great because although you might not love one story, you probably will dig a different one. The last story really makes you think. Good movie.",1
7237,"Great Coen Brother anthology, exploring both the darkness and humanity in people via Western storytelling.",1
7238,"A compilation of quirky and offbeat stories from the wild west. It's definitely got the Coen Brothers' style of drama and dark comedy, but the shorter stories seem pointless, waiting for a punchline that never comes.  Each is varied in its subject matter, all look good with strong acting and are interesting or entertaining in their own way.  One has great songs, one is tragic, one is weird and one taps into the purity of a simple life, but I was expecting something to tie them all together other than the setting.",1
7239,"4 years ago- The stories are painfully inconsistent and, while maintaining the director slickness of the typical Coen bros film, it loses some of the humor in the later stories.",0
7240,"Disappointing overall.  The primary tactic of the filmmakers was to get the audience attached to a character, only to, well you can guess what happens.  The prospector episode was pretty interesting, though.",0
7241,"hahaha, epic. the bouncing around was a little odd. -.5 stars for that. but id watch it again!",1
7242,A great LGBTQ movie.,1
7243,"Funny, romantic, charming, compelling, educational. Hits all the right notes. Wonderful cast. Great soundtrack. Powerful scenes.",1
7244,"As a coming of age LGBT film, this is decent. Its perhaps a little cheesy or cliched but I thought it was quite watchable. Its a pretty contemporary film with social media referenced. I imagine a lot of teenagers these days can relate to the awkward situations depicted. Its about peer pressure, shame and self identity I guess. Its funny and somewhat thoughtful film that I'd recommend, yes.",1
7245,"Worth watching, but it feels like unfulfilled potential. While it captures the feeling of high school akin to a John Hughes film, Simon's cohorts outside of the family feel half-baked and underwhelming as Simon's support system.

7247,"Love Simon, eine schwule Teenager-Romanze. Der erste Film eines großen Hollywood-Studios der das Thema anspricht. Der Film „Love, Simon"" verdient fünf Sterne, eine Paraderolle für Nick Robinson. Auch Logan Miller in der Rolle des Gegenspielers „Martin Addison"" ist nicht zu verachten.  Und nicht zu vergessen Natasha Rothwell als „Miss Albright"", die Schauspiellehrerin. Wie aus dem Leben gegriffen, die herrlich schrille Truppe die sie Unterrichtet. Love, Simon ist ein Film der ein wenig Geschichte schreibt.",1
7248,"This movie is a straight-man's gay film. Watching it felt like I was jumping through hoops of cliches and troupes designed to make straight people feel good about themselves for being allies. My point is proven in the relationship and interactions between Simon and Leah, alone. The ""I have a crush on you and you're gay so you lied to me"" plot is so incredibly toxic and harmful and the fact it goes mostly unaddressed in this film is ridiculous.",0
7249,"Endearing if somewhat by-the-numbers. All the fresh faces do very well. Its surprising one hasn't seen more of the talented cast since this movie. The sensitivity is just about right. One still waits for an edgier take on this topic. Meanwhile, 'Love, Simon' should do perfectly fine.",1
7250,"Just a teen struggling with his sexuality. I loved this kind of film before, but I think it's getting cliché these days.",0
7251,"Love, Simon made me reconsider my overall opinions on romantic movies. When done right, they can be so rewarding.",1
7252,Nicholas Cage's best film in years. This one really lets him stretch his talents from the most emotional to the most chaotic he can play while remaining grounded enough to hold you emotionally. It's a trip.,1
7253,"Well, that was bizarre.  While watching I was switching back and forth on whether it was ""good bizarre"" or ""bad bizarre.""  Ultimately I concluded it was not worth the time.",0
7254,"I've been told for years to watch this film. Not much of a Nicholas Cage freak out fan, so I assumed I would just see that on full throttle. I was wrong. But instead of being disinterested in another Cage fest, I was taken aback by the presentation of a truly and dementedly gross film. I may not be the right person to review this, as I tend to just dislike unnecessary gore. But here is seems reasonably warranted. You grow to hate the cult, and are not disappointed by the deliverance they are granted. It's a vile, putrid, and overly red display of B-movie, horror grade campiness mixed with actual effort to create a good film. I am not sure if they succeeded or not because I didn't like it in the end. But I could see how people may be. If people are trying to talk you into seeing this, let me assure you it is not a typical display of Nicholas Cage losing his feces yet again and punching girls out. There's more to this film, but be ready to be grossed out much more than once. I'm more than happy to die not having to watch this again.",0
7255,"Not that the movie was bad, it just wasn't for me.",0
7256,"10/10. 
The movie is excellent. Nicolas Cage is very good in the role. This movie is basically Progressive Rock Horror.
O filme é excelente. O Nicolas Cage está muito bom no papel. Este filme é basicamente um Horror de Rock Progressivo.",1

7258,"A very weird, brutal, trippy and red experience.",1

7267,"A gripping, entertaining, and wild ride, all built on Cho's stand-up performance.",1
7268,"The fact that the movie was all through a computer made me feel have less hope but they showed us EVERYTHING, the acting was good (nothing special) but the plot was surprise after surprise. The facetime, emails, photos, lives and home cameras was great. The mystery was great it keeps you engage the whole time waiting to find answers. Great recommendation and a most watch thriller!",1
7269,"I thought this was quite an intriguing film, in terms of making the viewer (particularly if its the younger generation) realise how much of our lives we may put online, whether that be behind a private, password-controlled account or not. It was an ironic film to watch at the time for me personally, as it just so happens I've decided the other day to make an effort not to be on social media as much as I used to be, as it has stressed me out and raised my anxieties a bit, particularly during this pandemic time (I'm typing this late Jan. 2021).

Anyway, the film is good - perhaps a little slow but not entirely badly paced. Everything we see is shown via webcam video footage and we see the father, who only after a while realises his daughter appears to have disappeared, typing and trying his hardest to access said daughters accounts, on the search for any clues to her whereabouts. I felt I could empathise with the situation he was in, not knowing too much about his daughters' social circle. Certain aspects of the plot that unfold, I felt I could personally relate to. On the slightly techy side of things, I'd almost forgotten about tumblr and I hadn't heard of MyCast either but I have now! also, I was surprised at the start when the dad loads the PC as it clearly shows an old version of Windows - I think XP but certainly, pre-Windows 7. Given this film was apparently released in 2017, it seems a pretty dated system to be running but maybe that's just the geek in me speaking up there? its not entirely relevant to the film I suppose. Having said that, I did notice that when video calls were incoming, they would often be branded as FaceTime calls (i.e. video calls communicating through iPhones), which implies its set pretty much in the modern-day.

The way the plot progresses isn't bad - there are frustrating moments and I saw things that made me wonder what had happened and all the rest of it but I'd say its a pretty low key kind of a film. Its thought-provoking in that it makes you think about how people and companies respond to certain situations. I won't say anymore so as not to provide spoilers but while I wouldn't say its an entirely amazing film as such overall, I thought it was quite good and certainly towards the end I did feel surprisingly gripped, so I would recommend it, yes.",1
7270,"My favorite movie of 2018.
If you haven't seen it, just watch it without knowing anything about the movie. Do you like mysteries? the suspense? the intrigue? the horror? strong emotions? the films that with little money achieve a lot? the different movies that give you fun with powerful messages? Then watch Searching alone, with friends, with your family or however you want. It is a complete success.",1
7271,Love every min of this movie.,1
7272,"This film didn't really work for me. What I mean is, it was relatively atmospheric, quite quriky and there was a somewhat nice sense of atmosphere but I couldn't quite get my head around what was going on in the plot. I usually quite like films that are a bit sombre and quiet, thoughtful etc. but this film seemed a bit overly padded, time wise and I felt not too sure quite what was going on. It just didn't quite work for me and yet it looks, at times, really quite good and I felt like I should be following it more than I did. Its good on one level but it doesn't work on another, so overall I can't really recommend it as such, no - it needs more substance to really work well, I feel.",0
7273,"Dedicated to Giuseppe Di Matteo, who was strangled and dissolved in acid by the Sicilian mafia (may the Devil take their souls) after being held captive for 779 days in an effort to stop his father from talking to prosecutors, this is a film that follows the efforts, led by a series a prophetic dreams, of one classmate to find the kidnapped boy. Beautifully filmed and performed, this film will leave a mark on your soul.",1
7274,"In a small Sicilian village a 13 year boy disappears, his best friend refuses to stop looking for him, despite the code of silence that has swept over the village and her being turned away at every point of inquiry.  She continues her search even with the sinister threats building against her.  To reveal anymore would reveal spoilers.
Any how, I heard this described as a dark fairy tale, the kind of story that might have previously attracted the attention of the like of Guillermo Del Toro and this is what attracted me to it, being a fan of the likes of Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water which I would class very much as dark fantasy.  This however, it just didn't grab me.  I found it to be an incredibly slow movie and a film that seemed to be on a lot longer than it was. All of the central players were decent enough but it took too long to get to any major plot development.  It's a shame because this had potential.",0
7275,"I liked, the bonkers 'Sicilian Ghost Story' until I didn't, but it's majestically filmed despite the ending.  If there ever was a movie, ""based on a true story"" this is it.  The outer edges are real, but holy moly do the directors take some poetic license to tell said tale.  Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza, who also co-wrote the feature, weave a Romeo and Juliet type tale, but it goes completely off the rails as neither could muster a finish worthy of the story.  It's in the title so this isn't a spoiler, but come on, do we really need a ghost?  It's hard to follow towards the end as we try to discern what's real and not, but it's safe to say that if you're memorializing someone the last scene doesn't work.  I need to feel the love between our two brilliant young actors: Julia Jedlikowska and Gaetano Fernandez.  Together they make magic on the screen.  Everyone else and there are lots of supporting players do NOTHING to help the film.  The characters aren't fleshed out and there are a couple interesting ones who basically show up then leave.  I was in 10 territory for about 2/3 of the film.  It's completely engrossing, and then poof.  It's a final act that made me sad, but not in the way the filmmakers intended.  Overall, I'm giving this the softest recommendation possible, but beware you may be frustrated.  Final Score: 6.5/10",1

(B)",1
7296,"This is certainly a very arty film - a black and white film mainly focussing on Polish culture linked with German culture and with a lot of Polish folk music and singing present. The singing is certainly good and the performances decent. While the film is about what could be called an unfortunate romance (mismatched people), I can't honestly say I found it an especially romantic type of a film as such. The fact it's filmed in black and white adds to the overall bleak feeling it has. It's an interesting film but quite slow in terms of plot. I thought this felt like a good film but it isn't entirely memorable or great, so I'd give it this rating (7 out of 10). If your particularly keen on arty type world cinema films then I'd recommend it, otherwise not so much.",1

After escaping to the West and leaving Zula behind, Wiktor must accept the fact that their relationship will be nothing more than sporadic, allowed only when the repressive Polish government allows her to leave the Communist Bloc to perform abroad, reinforcing the sentiment of a secondary character: ‘time doesn't matter when you're in love.'  One of the most beautifully shot films in recent memory, Cold War succeeds on the strength of its characters, solid performances (especially that of Krug), patient editing, and compelling moral dilemmas.

7303,"First off, I see this is categorised as a comedy film - I fail to see where the real laugh out loud typ comedy is in this film, as it tackles some important themes, though there are ocassionally very slightly amusing moments at a stretch I suppose. More than that, I definitely respected the main character, bar manager Lisa (played very well by Regina Hall) who really seems to have her colleagues/co-workers backs, as it were. It's fair to say she's tested by what she faces on the day this film covers and themes covered include sexual assault and violence. This is very much an American film, culturally speaking, set in a 'sports bar with curves' (think a 'Hooters' type bar). I enjoyed seeing the way the girls open up to one another and how Lisa dealt with things. This is a part sobering, ocassionally amusing watch, which is memorable and stands out for one main reason - the way the main character, Lisa, defends and supports her employees and how they help her. It felt somehow refreshing and re-assuring. It isn't a film I'd recommend from a comedy point of view but generally, as a character based drama about female independence, I'd say yes, its worth seeing, so I'd recommend it in that way, yes.",1
7304,"This film offers great insight into the modern experience of life, its highlights and low-lives. It's a parable, really.",1
7305,"Support the Girls is a beautifully quiet statement about feminsim. It's realistic, pragmatic and very human. Lisa is the manager of a sports bar in Texas named Double Whammies. It features skimpily dressed waitresses but she makes sure there are standards in place and treats the girls very well. It's like a family but like most families there is drama. Set over one day we go through the trials and tribulations of Lisa and her girls. She is under threat of firing from a petty owner and are enough little dramas to keep the day interesting. The film has a beautiful energy and as said it stakes its claim for feminism without hitting you over the head. Regina Hall is excellent as Lisa in a sea of good performances.

7311,"Support the Girls is one of those rare movies that is better the second or third time around. It sneaked up on me; I didn't see the curve coming, and on my first viewing, it seemed to lag ... but once Cubby fires Lisa, the film turns quickly. Masks start slipping. It's one character reveal after another, and little nagging thoughts kept popping up -- enough that I watched it again just to confirm my suspicions about how much foreshadowing had been going on.  The answer: a lot, but the movie doesn't tip its hand early.


Regina Hall as Lisa is superb and is the narrative foundation around whom the film is built, but it's not until the final scene that we really understand the iron triangle of Lisa, Maci (Haley Lu Richardson) and Danyelle (Shana McHayle) that was the secret sauce of Double Whammies. And Cubby fired all of them. At the very end, the film could have jumped ahead a month or so and shown the going out of business scene.


""Slice of life"" films may be tricky for theatrical productions, where the audience expects a narrative to build to a climax and a resolution in two hours, three at the max. But ""slice of life"" is where long-running television shows thrive, and Support the Girls would have been a fantastic pilot for a series with an ensemble cast worthy of a very long run. Of course, the tv pilot would have had to be plotted differently; too many people get fired in the movie. (Lisa fires two before Cubby fires the Big Three, and all five would be regulars in a series.) For a tv show you need to keep the cast around. But that's a manageable detail.


Every character in the core Double Whammies group -- employees and regular patrons alike -- has a couple of moments in which they show flashes of a complex underlying character, the kind of thing that a long-running tv show would build out over time. We are ""introduced"" to Officer Dominguez, for example, when Lisa tells the new trainees that a lot of police officers are regulars, and Maci, in her bubble-headed ditz mode, giggles that Officer Dominguez is a cutie. That creates a set of expectations -- but then we actually meet Officer Dominguez, who is splendidly professional and tactful in dealing with the burglar in the duct; we then see him as a sober, respectful patron; and he is a rock in the chaos scene when Maci and Danyelle kick off their rebellion. He is a protector, one of the adults in the room, and a friend.


So is Bobo, an obscure sideline figure cracking one-liners from her booth early in the movie, but another protector in the crunch. And one should notice that none of the regular Double Whammies group are at all surprised when Bobo rises to the occasion in a moment of crisis; they already know her.


The professor? He's a completely comic figure, certainly -- he can't be otherwise given the age difference in his secret relationship -- but he's an elderly gentleman (emphasis on ""gentleman""), probably a lonely widower, who had been a professor and a lawyer, who steps forward when one of the girls needs legal assistance, and who we learn at the end is a ""really nice man"" who treats his much younger romantic interest really nicely as well. And she would know -- because by the end of the movie we realize that Maci isn't a bubble-headed ditz at all, but a natural sweetheart with her head screwed on straight who knows exactly what she's doing, chocolate milk and all. It's no accident that the film opens with Lisa crying in her car and Maci, the first to arrive, pecking at the window and comforting her boss. Here's betting that Maci is always the first to arrive, and she probably closes the place too. (Haley Lu Richardson is brilliant at acting in the background; she's one of the best scene stealers in the business today. She and Regina Hall are a terrific pair and I'd love to see them work together again.)


Go on down the list. The whole core group would be excellent series regulars in a long-running show. Even Cubby, terrible boss that he is, is obviously a deeply unhappy man, trapped somewhere he doesn't want to be, with a backstory to be unpacked. If this were a tv show, I'm betting that he'd be a sympathetic character by season three. Part of me wishes that this project had been picked up by one of the streaming networks for that purpose.

7329,"this is a really great movie, but for 10 minutes or so around the climax it relies far too heavily on shouting and is unnecessarily loud and abrasive at times when there is no real reason for it, characters repeat themselves during the arguments and it feels like the director was making them act out too much when the point could have been made without so many voices being raised or characters acting so chaotic. even people who act like the antagonist generally aren't just shouting at the top of their lungs in public all the time. this really killed my enjoyment of the last 20% of the film, and i found myself wanting to fast forward through the arguments because they genuinely weren't of importance to the plot. critics called this movie ""explosive"", and gave it unanimously amazing reviews, so i have to assume that the creators were hell bent on getting awards by making the film jarring or something, but there was really no reason for ""miles"" to be the one screaming in an alley way when he was not going through anything personally at the time. this really doesn't fit with the dark comedy/light drama atmosphere of the film, nor does it fit with the social commentary, and in my opinion the scene could easily have ended after the fight outside the party. i also think that the rap/spoken word thing at the end was a little forced when the rest of the music was strictly bay area, and it even broke back out into that right afterwards. i guess the point was ""ill say it like this so white people will pay attention"" though",1

7331,"*Minor Spoilers in the review*
Between the fantastic writing, talented cast and impactful themes and messages, it's an amazing movie. The cast portrays their characters with such realism and passion and the story is one that is somewhat familiar to us. In the event of a racially motivated killing, how does it affect the community, and those involved?

*Minor Spoiler alert*
My absolute favorite part of this film was the use of spoken-word performances throughout the film. One such scene is the nightmare scene. In the scene Colin is having a nightmare where he suddenly shows up in the courtroom where he sat at the beginning of the movie. He is the defendant and handcuffed to the spot where he is sitting. His best friend Miles is the prosecutor, the judge, ends up being the cop and the jury is a group of black men. Throughout the nightmare, Miles is giving a case against him in the form of spoken word while Miles struggles to speak. It isn't until the end the Colin is able to speak and he is screaming for help. 

*Spoilers over*

I also loved the use of comedy throughout the movie.  I feel like it wasn't used in a way that undercut the more serious tones and messages of the movie, but it still helped the movie from being unbearably heavy and dark. It made me smile and made the movie much more enjoyable.",1

7335,"It's a movie that wears a few hats and wears them quite well. It's a cry for the environment and for hope over hopelessness, and against the commercialization and politicization of the church and the mindless destruction of resources for the sake of greed. This is all carried out through the story of dying pastor of a historic church known more for being a stop for tourists than a place of worship. It's a lot all at once but it comes together in great harmony. The pacing can be a tad wonky and the ending is desperate to be more than it actually is, but First Reformed is ultimately more than the sum of its parts and shows grace can still be found in our hard hearted world.",1
7336,"I enjoyed it a lot. For a movie this slow paced, I was never bored. In fact, the atmosphere that's created is something else. The acting pulls you in and the strange plot line keeps you glued to your seat.",1
7337,'First Reformed'  is written and directed by Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader. The film echoes the Martin Scorsese classic in its central theme of an alienated male whose disillusionment with society steadily climbs towards boiling point. Schrader explores this by having his protagonist undergo a crisis of faith while also having his views challenged by encounters with modern environmentalism. This is an absorbing and bleak film featuring an Ethan Hawke who has rarely been more compelling.,1

Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke), a pastor in upstate New York with a dwindling congregation, has come to a philosophical crossroads as he ponders the bleak future of the planet as well as his commitment to his faith.  It's pretty bleak and sobering stuff, thanks to Schrader's uncompromising script and disciplined direction as well as Hawke's austere performance as the trouble protagonist.  First Reformed forces the audience to do something that seems rare in cinema these days – the need to think.  It is a film that is both rewarding and harrowing.",1

7357,"Sorry to Bother you is the craziest commentary on modern society that I have seen to date. It talks about our roles as individuals in the economy and how corporate climbing can be good for the individual but can hurt us all as a whole. It talks about working conditions in factories and compares them to modern-day slavery. It talks about the ones at the top and the ones at the bottom. The worst part is I could see all of this happening up until the last 40 mins. This all-star cast commands the audience's attention and punches them in the face with the truth of our modern-day capitalist society and what it can turn into if we don't watch closely those that hold the power. It makes all of these statements in a unique colorful way that is unlike anything I've ever seen before but at the same time in a story that we have seen 100 times, the hero's journey. The ending was a bit of a twist and left everything open-ended but at the same time we, as the audience, can infer what is going to happen next. The movie was so fast-paced but at the same time, I felt like it was perfect for the attention span of modern audiences. I am not usually a fan of movies like this, which is wacky and try to say something in a roundabout way but this one caught me off guard and I do recommend it to anyone of modern audiences as it shows us our future if we are not careful.",1
7358,"This film is, it'd seem, very much an anti-corporate America type film I think, from what I could tell. Its quite quirky and has something of a trippy feel to it, with bright coloured lights and some CGI/special effects depicting characters as other species, giving it a distinctly artificial and somewhat spooky feel. It didn't really land well with me overall, it felt a bit too much without a solid feel of direction or some proper context or explanation given. It reminded me somewhat of Idiocracy, which I prefered as a film. I wouldn't particularly recommend this film as such, no.",0

7361,"A very heavy film, with an important message, but clunky execution. I believe the director is acting in earnest, but he's preaching to the choir. He needs to trust his audience more; he doesn't need to be so obivous and heavy handed with his handling of the core themes.",1
7362,"A masterpiece!
A great farewell.",1
7363,"Abbas Kiarostami's last film - a film he also knew would be his last one. I have seen a few of his films and he is probably the most known Iranian director of all time. The consept is simple. 24 still shots - all of them lasts for four and a half minute. Things happen on screen. There's not much. Mostly just cows, birds or other animals. Often in snowy or watery environments.

I like the idea a lot, but not the excecution. It's basically an animated film, but it is flat. No words, mostly no big happenings. The sound is the best feature here and the fact that you never will be stuck with a picture for more than five minutes.
Speaking of pictures, it was originally ment to concist of different painings - edited into before and after they were painted. He does this this in the first scene, ""Frame 1"" but the rest stick with (often) heavy edited live shots.

Some interesting angels, and there are some impressive stills, but this is just too flat and it's way too easy to look away as I never felt any stories gave me much within the first 30 seconds. Frame 13 and a couple other's where good, but that's about it. I did not find this to be a proper farewell to a great director.

7366,"C'est un film tres beau
I find the negative audience reviews here for this beautiful film hugely disappointing. Freeze almost any frame and you find a work of art. And the story is beautifully and tacitly developed. Much is done by facial expression and incidentals rather than overt obvious dialogue - and I find this adds to the film's beauty and impact. Nathalie Baye (Hortense) is perfect in her part as the matriarch of the family farm. And I don't find this to be a feminist film at all. The women have to manage the farm themselves simply because the men are away in a wart that will inevitably damage them. Hortense's love for her two boys shines convincingly when she meets them off the train when they are on leave. My favourite scene is Hortense and her daughter Solange leaning on a fence towards the end of the film - they even look like mother and daughter.",1

7383,"I always think of a movie as an art piece when I go away and have to think about it for a bit. This certainly got me thinking, however when I read the critics analysis and probably even the screenwriter's analysis my depiction was totally different. That is the beauty of art right? 

I saw this film as the hopelessness of the sex industry. The competitive nature of it and the hardcore bad treatment of females in sex work. Lola works really hard at making it in an industry that is flakey, fickle with no future prospects, no recognition and no empathy. She is a hard worker, competitive and creative. Yet she has to hide this from most people. This powerful drive she displays in a flimsy type of industry leads to her own destruction. 

Her stage bedroom is pretty, organised and of course very fake, it also infantilises her. She is pretty much a grown female yet she alludes to being younger. Her bedroom and real life, in contrast, is a mess. Strewn clothes, messed up bed sheets and disrupted sleeping patterns. She has pushed herself outside the lines of normal society. The only thing keeping her life normal is that she is lucky enough to have a family that she has to pretend to. It depicts cam girls as smart, savvy and determined, the people who watch her less so. They appear gullible and stupid in contrast. She uses them and their brainlessness to get ahead. This turns on her when 'something takes over her account' which oddly happens when she reaches the top 50. Not so odd, considering this is where the apparent success line lies. I feel this 'thing' is the damaged part of herself, the part that has to succeed in a sh**ty industry at all costs. It goes on to create havoc in her life. Perhaps the legacy of her past actions is there to haunt her forever? Plus cam companies probably now showcase her as she becomes less creative and more robotic. It is no secret that many, not all sex workers, are suffering from PTSD. Her co-worker now deceased is still performing? How is that so? The industry is famous for making money out of shows that were posted years ago despite what happened to the actor in the shows. It's all about the bottom line. The tension in the movie was excellent, well-produced and kept you on the edge of your chair, peppered with realism and overlaid with the pointlessness of it all is indeed a very interesting horror stage. The lengths Lola goes to own herself and her work is scary and also admirable.",1

Such a large part of the runtime is spent on relatively normal or in a vacuum uninteresting conversations and activities - it took a good while before I even began to understand what the movie was about. Everything eventually starts to make sense though and when it does the movie takes new life as a very suspenseful thriller. Great performances, directing and score all add to this and what I think is most impressive is that despite the tone shift the movie sticks to its hyper-realism. The movie has an impersonal detachment from its characters that is quite refreshing and it doesn't even hurt investment.",1
7407,"An extremely intelligent an thought-provoking arthouse film, ""Burning,"" while at times boring, definitely makes up for it especially towards the end. A really great film that definitely stands as one of the better Korean films to date. Would absolutely recommend.",1
7408,To be punny - it's definitely a slow burn. Far smarter with its commentaries than the overwrought overpraised Parasite. This movie allows the viewers to think for themselves.,1
7409,"This films deals with some deep themes, such as mortality, identity/belonging, jealousy and understanding. Its quite a thoughtful film but there isn't much in the way of a solid plot as such going on, so you may find it rather directionless. Its quite an arty sort of a film, very much about symbolism and with a sort of a philosophical angle to it. 

I thought it was interesting to hear the Koreans (Oriental?) take on African culture, for one thing. It definitely has a sense of wistfulness about it and there are some nice camera shots showing sunsets, the light dimming and similar, which add to the atmospheric feel of the film. Its  understated but it didn't feel painfully slow and boring, so to me it was still very much a decent, solid film, as long as your a fan of subtle, character focussed films and can imagine yourself placed in somebody elses shoes. 

I should point out that this film does feature a number of scenes (or parts of scenes) with silence -there is a distinct lack of dialogue at times. I imagine we, the viewer, are intended to ponder what the main character is thinking or feeling/contemplating at that time, or otherwise to take in the scenery. Certainly, Lee Jong-Su (the main character) comes across as somewhat of an unsure person, a little guarded and quite introverted. There's quite a strong sense of poignancy present. 

One down side, however, is that not all questions are answered by the end, so if your not keen on films with unanswered questions then this may frustrate you. Ultimately, however, it goes without saying that this is quite a mysterious sort of a film. I won't elaborate, so as not to provide any spoilers but I would recommend this film to fans of world cinema, definitely.",1

European, Asian, etc. where we have bailed folks out). I hope this movie doesn't reflect any current reality on debt!! 😢😢This movie is Not about a SK killer, rather about a country bou who discovered a young woman's way out of debtor's prison and decided to take (justifiable) revenge.

7430,"What a beautiful and heartbreaking film. From writer/director Barry Jenkins, who also gifted us with the amazing Oscar winning film Moonlight. During my journey this year to see all the Oscar winning Best Pictures, Moonlight was among the films I would consider in the Top Five of all those I watched. Because of that, my hopes were high for this one and I wasn't disappointed.
The film stars Kiki Layne and Stephen James as a young couple full of love, hope, dreams and commitment to each other. Their growth together as a couple horrendously marred when one of them is unjustly imprisoned for something they didn't do.  Sadly, much of what this film lays bare is an all too common and inexcusable travesty of how our U.S. criminal justice system operates.
Stephen James has been on my radar now after seeing him in several other films/series. This film confirmed my belief that he is bound to be an Oscar winning actor in the years ahead. And of course Regina King, in her supporting role, was magnificent as always.  I will now make it a personal mandate to see anything and everything that Barry Jenkins directs.",1

Wife: 6.2/Hubby: 5.0 Average: 5.6/10",0
7442,"A great film. Within 130 minutes one sees a tragedy unfold - a tragedy that is not an accident or a mistake. Two irresponsible parents who have never loved, as they themselves have never been loved, in a society that does not care about the Other; a society lost in its superficial prosperity or even in its pursuit of comfort as its ultimate goal. Zvyagintsev makes a critique of the society of indifference by exploring an incident that highlights its tragic nature. So when the film shows us the new 'adventures' of the parents, we cannot do anything but wonder where the child is. And this is the main feeling I got from the film. After all, it is not just about Russia - humans worldwide are experiencing a moral crisis. So, where is the child? And what has gone so wrong that the value of comfort, of a well-paying job, of good reputation, is more important than the value of empathy, of the values that constitute our human nature? Where have we lost the child?",1
7443,"When I saw a Zvyagintsev film for the first time I was really fascinated by it, the movie I'm referring to is Leviathan, that's been critically acclaimed and also loved by the public for an infinite number of good reasons. I approached Loveless full of expectations and I must say that they were not unfulfilled at all.
Loveless is an amazing film, which presents themes that other directors have already touched in the past, but it does so with a very personal and recognizable style. The narrative is dry and goes straight to the point, analysing in depth the failings of two parents too focused on their lives. The actors are absolutely exceptional, even the supporting ones.
Just as in Leviathan, here too hope finds little room, for it is crushed by people who are so selfish they are incapable of looking after the needs of others. What makes it all even more suffocating are the settings: the director's Russia is often a ""concrete block"", the rooms are gloomy, the sky always grey.
Krichman's photography adds an extra touch of class, elevating Loveless to a small modern masterpiece. I expected a beautiful film and again I was not disappointed.",1
7444,"As its title suggests this morbid Russian movie claims to be attempting to draw attention to a national crisis – the desperate plight of children who struggle to cope with self-obsessed parents and an uncaring national police dept.  Director Andrey Zvyagintsev and co-writer Oleg Negin (both also responsible for ‘Leviathan' '14 an equally depressing Russian movie) are again taking a savage swipe at Russian institutional corruption – they've used the same format for this, their latest collaboration. The poster advertising suggests this movie will study the impact on the child during a heavy marital separation.  Instead, these collaborators spend so much time with perverse voyeuristic scenes of both parents' extramarital sex lives – leaving the suffering of the poor child, mostly to our imagination (if they were truly serious, perhaps this should have been reversed?)  

This is just one aspect that tends to put the focus of their movie in mostly the wrong places. Another is its obsessive ‘promo' style study of a volunteer group of missing-child-hunters who up-stage the indifference of the Russian police. This at times feels to be from another movie, and is the sort of ‘story' telling best served as a documentary; perhaps even inspiring more social impact than an enacted drama. In the beginning, the young lad has one or two strong scenes; but the rest highlights the soulless parents, and simply keeps telling us what we already know, stretched over two long hours.

The majority of the dialogue has the parents viciously swearing, and being brutally vulgar towards each other in front of their son - when this is not happening (which is not often) we see them constantly obsessing over their mobile phones (a worldwide phenomenon) and being selfishly absorbed. As with Leviathan, these collaborators seem to single out Christians (as if they are the chief perpetrators of these situations) along with the Russian government for its uncaring bureaucracy. Corruption in Government institutions often needs to be exposed but might also be done in a less heavy-handed manner.  Cinematographer, Mikhail Krichman sets up stylish images and gives this movie its best asset. The open-ended ending is also a let down with the last shot being a little unbelievable. 

Professional reviewer Emily Yoshida of Vulture.com has been honest enough to call this work out, citing it as, Quote; ""A dour film with unlikeable characters and a lack of focus to make a coherent point"" (I tend to agree)  Otherwise, the usual Awards and accolades proliferate as might be expected in this business of promoting a product.",0
7445,Powerful and heartbreaking. True to human nature. Don't look for trite resolutions. ,1
7446,Actor-turned-director Paul Dano's intimate indie is compelling of course but in a 100 minute runtime the film doesn't seem to have much of a third act or fitting resolution.,0
7447,"This is a slow family based drama film set in the 1960s. Its very slow, plot wise but it seems clear early on that there are things going on which we're not necessarily fully aware of and so that kept me curious enough to keep watching - that and the 1960s setting, the fashions etc. 

Its very much a film about marriage, family life and trust; with the focus being on the son and his mother. If it was set in modern day and about an average family, I maybe wouldn't be quite so interested to keep watching but I found it a fairly light and easy watch regardless. I liked the sense that the viewer was about to uncover something fairly big at any moment. I wasn't surprised the son was concerned and doubtful about things relating to his father.

I could tell quite early on that this was a book adaptation and indeed it is, its based on the book by Richard Ford. The slow plot development was the main clue, I'd say.

This isn't a film that will appeal to everyone (few do that) but its not bad as a film about a family struggling to do well for themselves and to stay properly together. I won't say anymore so as not to provide any spoilers. I'm not sure I'd especially recommend this as such unless your already keen to see it, as it is quite slow and may bore some people but for what it is, its not too bad.",0
7448,"A beautiful, subtly intimate drama set in small-town Montana and against the state's big skies. Carey Mulligan's is the outstanding, multi-layered performance, bringing real empathy to a character it would be easy to dislike by the film's end. Gyllenhall as her husband and Ed Oxenbould as their son deserve mention also - this is tangibly, relatably real family about which we feel almost guilty observing live through these traumas; but alongside that is the overwhelming feeling that this could be any of us - such is the empathy and insight of this film. 

The writing also aids this, with Paul Dano's debut direction - and the wonderful cinematography always giving us context, even allowing the sense of the grand scale of the natural environment weighing down, impinging, oppressing even in town. Mirroring and contributing to the family's issues, this a natural world of stark hostility, calling out from the film a nuanced discussion on masculinity and family relationships that lies at its heart; it is the natural world that both invites and disrupts this, and it's the subtly brilliant cinematography that makes it so powerful. 

An excellent, subtle and powerful drama that will linger long and likely repay repeated viewings.",1
7449,"While the three main actors give great performances, the script is poor, and all-in-all it's a very awkward hour-and-a-half. You are shown a perfectly functional family, and very quickly both parents start a cascade of completely irrational actions contradicting in every way the characters that were first presented. When the embarrassment has gone far enough, it ends on a deus-ex-machina happy ending as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie.",0
7450,"This is one of those films with a good cast that you're not sure what to expect and it turns out to be pretty special.  Directed by Paul Dano, this tells the story of a very dysfunctional family seen through the eyes of a couples teenage son, played flawlessly by Ed Oxenbould, as he watches his once seemingly perfect family splinter after a series of events cause strife and unexpected reactions.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan play the parents.  
Excellent performances keep you riveted to the screen.",1
7451,"Exceptionally depressing. Mulligan was excellent and Gyllenhal when he got angry really made the movie light up for a moment from the gloom. Otherwise, I'd like two hours of my life back.",0
7452,"Very well acted and well photographed drama. Great sets too. It is rather depressing and drags now and then as not much happens in this simple story. However, it is very well realised and definitely worth viewing.",1
7453,"The story is simple and honest. The most hate this movie gets is that the protagonist isn't more ""emotional"". By the way he's 14 there isn't much he can do but he gives a pretty good performance.

Again its a very simple story. I gave it 5 stars because its the first movie I've seen that's give ANY* real acknowledgement to this sort of thing.

""feminists"" will probably be offended.",1
7454,Top notch in every way that counts.,1
7455,"It's a shame we haven't seen Paul Dano behind the camera more often, although I guess it's early days. Wildlife, his first foray into direction, boasts an exceptional performance from Carey Mulligan whose son (a brilliant Ed Oxenbould) has to deal with her complicated response to her husband (an always great Jake Gyllenhaal) taking a job away fighting wildfire, and, one could argue abandoning them. What Dano does so well is to allow the film to slowly reveal who it is actually about, it very much begins as a domestic tale between a husband and wife as the child is sidelined, but the second half puts their son front and centre, making for a harrowing and compelling viewing experience. At no point do you feel comfortable throughout the film, the air hangs with tension from the start to the finish, and the final shot of the film, in my opinion, couldn't be more perfect. Dano and his cast have produced something excellent.",1
7456,"Try as it might, it's not interesting or endearing to watch the victimhood parade of a transwoman trying not to lash out against an onslaught of strawmen. Aside from a redundant earful about self-worth and how there is no deeper meaning in the most devastating events in our lives, this movie is the apex of caricaturing the issues of transgender people, dialing it up to the max level of absurdity, living the actual story of grief in a perpetual duel with it, and soaking it all in the dying jazz and whimsically off-putting soundtrack. At least the visuals are decent, and many delusions scenes are very well paced and integrated. 
Aside from Vega, almost everyone's performance is atrocious, and it has nothing to do with the actors. Anyone who is an ally has no character. Their character is that they are an ally of Marina. Meanwhile, racist and transphobic scum are all caricatures. You've got it all: Orlando's son, who tells Marina he finds her disgusting but is visibly aroused by the thought of it. wife, who is madly jealous that her husband apparently chose her over their family, and doctors who call the police to snitch on Marina. truck full of the Chilean version of rednecks with ""feathers and tar."" Tone-deaf cops who are so disquieted that they simply humiliate Marina for no reason. I can go on and on because that's the whole movie, the most blunt and conspicuous things that definitely happen. Plus the obnoxious Orlando ghost sightings, which become increasingly amusing as the number increases.",0
7457,"This is a quite powerful film which features a very impressive performance by the main actor, Daniela Vega, as Marina Vidal. It's sad to see how people treat her due to her being transgender. Its very much a piece of social commentary. I was quite impressed by the steely look of determination on her face, when she has to deal with insults and hatred. I felt the film was quite immersive due to the sheer power of presence she has.

This is very much a thought provoking film, one I'd highly recommend for its ability to make you question the point of view of a transgender person in the scenario Marina finds herself in (having lost her partner).",1
7458,"Delicate and intense film, one of the director's best",1
7459,nice actor but not good script,0
7460,Sebastián Lelio's 'A Fantastic Woman' is a powerful film about loss from a number of angles.  Daniela Vega steals the show as a trans woman playing a trans woman.  She's great and when the movie is focused it's fantastic.  The colors Lelio uses to enhance the drama in addition to some of the great camerawork bring some moments that will stay with the average viewer.  Final Score: 8/10,1

It follows Marina, a transgender nightclub singer, who comes under suspicion when her much older lover dies suddenly and is harassed and threatened by his lover's vengeful relatives and the police. It shows the unfair struggle when people have to defend their own rights as a human being, when they are just different. It is realistic and portrays a society we definitely need to get rid of. Daniela Vega's performance is riveting and conveys all the pain and is successful in causing rage in the viewer before all that injustice, suffering and humiliation the main character is subject to.",1
7466,"The best movie ever made! With the best acting ever by an ensemble, including the best acting performance from Olivia Colman! Plus, the best casting ever done in a movie! Also, the best directing from Yorgos Lanthimos! As well as the best movie screenplay ever written! Not to mention the best editing ever done in a movie! Not only that, but the best production design ever made in a movie! And the best makeup and hairstyling ever done in a movie!",1
7467,"The movie was filled with depravity. I regret that I watched it, especially with my teenage daughter. I am so sorry. ",0
7468,"This film features plenty in the way of majesty and grandeur. Being a Yorgos Lanthimos film, its really quite insular and almost voyeuristic in a sense, with the fish eye lens camerawork. There are some sexual scenes present and also very strong, graphic language used throughout, so be aware of that (hence the 15 rating it carries). There is a distinct sense of back stabbing present and it was an intriguing watch, seeing who attempts to out smart or out-do who and so on. The costumes are, of course, lavish and the cast all do well in their roles, which certainly helps. This is a film well worth seeing, for Olivia Coleman and Emma Stones performances, if nothing else - just don't expect it to be a Downtown Abbey type film, mostly suitable for family viewing, as this isn't.  Its, at heart, a film depicting power play.

Its about as edgy as most of Lanthimos' other films, with some good pieces of witty dialogue and also worth mentioning, I feel, is the classical score, which helps add to the atmosphere of most scenes. It may be a slightly slow moving film, plot wise, but its certainly an engrossing watch overall, so I recommend it on that basis.",1

7482,"Incredibles II is surprisingly not that bad. Go figure its actually pretty good. This movie had a lot to live up to based on the first movies positive reception, and while I don't think its nearly as good as the first one, I don't think anyone thought is would be anyway. It does its own thing and I think its does it pretty well. Its exciting, and the while the villain is lack luster, the villain is not what makes this movie. That would be the action. it is just as good if not better than the original, although there are still a few issues I have. The biggest is the violence. This movie has few light swears, which I do like for this movie, but compared to the original, this movie is so much more light. The original was surprisingly messed up a lot of the time. Mr. Incredible got in so many situations that basically ended with him easily defeated. In this movie all the violence is kind of taken down an notch which is annoying, but the movie is still pretty good beside that. 7.5/10",1
7483,It is the most INCREDEBEL movie out there! Must see now!,1
7484,"Incredibles 2 was a crushing disappointment for me. It picks up right where the first movie left off with the battle with the Underminer, and it just doesn't make any sense. The Underminer declares war on the world, and then he proceeds to just rob a bank. Mr. Incredible is portrayed as an idiot in this movie. Instead of sneaking up behind the Underminer and knocking him out, he starts monologuing, the same thing the first movie made fun of. Also somehow the Underminer can go toe to toe with Mr Incredible as well as tanking some of his punches. Destruction happens and the supers get blamed for it. I thought this was implied to be resolved in the last movie, but whatever. After this the Underminer completely disappears from the movie, because that's what the fans wanted right? All these problems are in the very first 15 minutes of the movie by the way. Helen is very unlikable in this movie, admitting it was wrong that they came out of hiding and became supers again. Dash is completely out of control and reckless, how has to push any and all buttons he sees. Violet becomes completely obsessed with the boy she likes, and is also unlikeable. All the characters are just not acting the same as they once were, it's character assassination. The actual villain in this movies plan makes no sense. Evelyn Deavors plan is to get supers legal again, just for her to get them illegal again. Mr Incredibles strength has been nerfed, cant even get past a bunch of pipes, i can just go on and on. Sure theres some good stuff in this movie, but the bad completely outweighs the good for me. Incredibles 2 was a big disappointment for me and i just dont like it.",0

A documentary like a million I've seen before. I'm almost always a fan of documentaries but this one just didn't do it for me.

I found some interesting information from this and it did open my eyes to an unfortunate way some things work in politics.

This is really one of those films with a very limited target audience (though to be fair most documentaries are lol).

I recommend it for everyone who wants to understand what is really happening in ""the swamp!""",1
7491,"The KEY takeaway - never TRUST political hit pieces in the last six weeks of an election. It's usually from an unidentified source with an agenda. I agree there is Dark Money in politics, and it exists in both parties. I wish the movie showed examples in both parties, to have a fair, open airing of this issue. I found the Federal Election Commission complaint that the Republicans we're voting in a block laughable, because the Democrats were doing the same. Voters deserve to have a quiet enjoyment of electing their state and federal representatives without billionaires, unions, corporations, activists groups and the like interfering with local voters choosing their preferred representation.",0

US Supreme Court enabled these methods with the ""Citizens United vs Federal Election Commission"".  Movie shows us exactly how the new legalized bribery works.",1
7494,"A chilling documentary, I was perhaps most struck by the fact that it focuses almost entirely on Republican candidates being undermined by dark money. This is NOT a partisan issue but one that affects all of us. Interestingly the film focuses on Montana state representative races as a microcosm of what is going on at a national level. Montana had long prided itself on having the strictest campaign finance laws in the country which assured that they got populist ""citizen-legislators."" However, federal laws and court decisions have undermined the states laws and allowed anonymous corporate and other big money donors to literally pick candidates for state races there. The film also showcases the desperate need for serious investigative journalism in this era, and how hard it is to actually be a journalist these days.",1
7495,"This movie follows the struggles of state Republican and Democratic Montana politicians being under siege by dark money campaigns done by faceless 501c4s funded by unknown corporate entities, a investigative journalist, and a corruption trial, showing a microcosm for what is happening nationally in America. If you don’t have a clue about campaign financing, this documentary shows these issues grippingly and chillingly. An eye-opener and excellent filmmaking. ",1

7498,"Meh.  Slow and plodding, but different enough to be mildly interesting.",0
7499,"'Western' is a journey that I must admit I didn't really understand until I started to look at it from an individual character's standpoint.  For a film that used mostly novice actors (you won't find any with a Wikipedia page), the writer and director, Valeska Grisebach, uses everything in her toolbox to cultivate a movie that engages.  While I didn't find myself caring about any of the players, I was mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the film. This foreign language film as a character study of a man who in his own way is going through a mid-life crisis will resonate in any language.  Final Score: 7.2/10",1
7500,A patient look at inherent cultural conflict that ends up rendering the conflict mundane and undramatic.,0
7501,This movie SUCKED! It was slow and so boring. Don't waste your time,0

7503,"A group of German construction workers are dispatched to rural Bulgaria to build a water power plant. At times, the two cultures will amiably co-exist despite the language barriers, but at other times tensions, and even hostilities, will emerge. There are also tensions within the construction workers themselves, especially between the mysterious new worker (Meinhard Neumann) and the overly aggressive foreman (Reinhardt Wetrek). 

Definitely,not for those seeking an action flick, as this is a methodically paced and cerebral movie, where the intensity slowly builds. Successfully utilizing non-professional actors, the atmospherics and realism here are spot-on, as you feel like you are right there in rural Bulgaria. Overall,if one has the patience to get into this type of slow-burn foreign film there are rewards to be found here.",1
7504,"I liked the style and the documentary-like filming, but all the tension slowly building up never find a release. Just like in real life? Probably. Still in this particular movie,this fact left me unsatisfied. Nonetheless a good movie.",0

7506,"A lot of fun look at the Austin music scene, but everything else is pretty lame. Most of all, Ben Dickey is just not interesting to watch here. Completely flat and boring and really ruins the whole movie considering he's the entire purpose and soul of it. Fun to see some supporting cast members here including a Texan douche businessman Richard Linklater. Just wish this had a better performance in the center and more script rather than just showing the Austin scene with a score behind it.",0
7507,"His character will win you over, and the layout of the storyline works well. I really liked the tone of the film. It plays like one of his songs, of which you’ll definitely get a taste. FREE advice: Turn on the subtitles. I don’t think the sound mixing was top-notch and the way they speak is a little tricky to pick up. Once I did, the film was much more enjoyable. ",1
7508,"I'm stumped. Why everyone adores this film has me scratching my head. I can see the positives... the colors, the mood and the acting in particular. But through most of the film, everyone is drunk or mumbling...I can't understand a word that's being said...or sung for that matter. Is the moody mumbling passing as gravitas?  

The songs are just okay, nothing special. They're your basic country or folk song patterns with lyrics that are decent (provided you can hear them), but worthy of a biopic that deifies the guy? No. Absolutely not. As a singer songwriter myself, I've known a dozen or so solid artists over the years who TRULY had great songs and never made it either... that's what happens in the music biz 99 percent of the time. While it's nice to see one plucked from the obscurity bin by a Hollywood elite, why Hawke picked Foley when there are so many better unknown artists to focus on is a mystery. I barely made it to the end as I was simply bored. Put it this way: when you turn to your cat and ask, ""Do YOU like this movie?"" and she starts pawing at the treats bag, and THAT'S what you find entertaining, you know the film is dull. I'm a huge fan of just about everything Hawke does but he lost me with this one.",0

 Last night I watched it with some family members who thought it was a little. I love the days of the treehouse. The filming is beautiful. This is a melancholy film I wouldn't call it a bit but I would call it charming. If you love music and artistic independent films this is the movie for you.",1

There are quite a few neat cameos, including one with longtime collaborator Richard Linklater.  This is rather excellent, with just enough music.  A bit of a hard yet rewarding watch.  Deep down it's a love story, but perhaps more with music than human nature.  Final Score: 8.4/10",1
7514,"This movie was a heartwarming story of wasted talent and wasted love.  The characters were likable and tragic with the exception of Sybil (sp), who was grounded and had a sense of who she was and what she wanted to do.

7516,"This is a bleak and harsh watch, with a very rural setting - a somewhat unforgiving one, you could say. There are plenty of scenes with little dialogue and when there is dialogue, most of it (not all but a lot) consists of shouting from white men towards the aborigines. I certainly felt sorry for the natives, the way they were (badly) treated - indeed it made me feel curious to learn more about them and their culture. The cinematography is pretty impressive and overall its a good watch, so I'd recommend it on that basis, as long as your ok with subtitles, as there are quite a lot of them, due to the Aboriginal language spoken by natives.",1

The ugly racism and violence against the Aboriginals portrays a country where the white man's word is law. Even so I loved this movie. The acting is superb. Hamilton Morris as Sam Kelly is brilliant. Bryan Brown who I loved In A Town Like Alice played a flawed and ruthless Australian Sergeant. Scenes of the Australian Outback are stunning.,1

I was frustrated with the displacement of the Aborigine people by the White man. I was frustrated by Philimac. The movie made me think of slavery-time America.  I was frustrated by Sam and his wife not feeling able to testify on their own behalf but accepting blame and shame for what happened. Yet, all of that frustration I felt made me feel the movie was believable action(s).  I nearly shot through the roof at the final scene.  Great Movie!",1

7527,An intriguing and captivating low budget film. The Endless has just enough tension and mystery that it held my attention and peaked my interest here and there. It is very cool to find out the director's previous movies are also linked to this movie in subtle ways.,1
7528,"The Endless is one of the later low-budget films from the writing-directing-acting team of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, before they got their big-money break with Moon Knight. Initially a psychological drama focused on a pair of brothers coming to terms with their adolescence spent in a cult, the great aspect of the film is it's genre evolution, which defies expectations. What you initially assume is going to be a battle of perspectives weighing family loyalty against charismatic deception ends up becoming a supernatural horror that incorporates unknown cosmic entities with Lovecraftian elements. 

While a decent standalone example of the modern trend that tries to combine fleshed-out domestic conflict with an unusual supernatural twist, the most entertaining and rewarding aspect is the late tie-in with the filmmakers' earlier work, Resolution, which explored not only similar dynamics but left several questions surprisingly unanswered. While a bit light on the ultimate payoff regarding the relationship between the two brothers, there is enough in the premise and the creep factor to make The Endless worth a watch, particularly with its soft prequel. 

There is also one comically oversized padlock that I was really into. (3.5/5)",1
7529,"No question this is the very best of its genre (movies about cults).

The story was strikingly original and clever.  The actors were top notch and the characters they played were fascinating.  And for all it's ""out there"" content, this movie somehow managed not to sink to the level of campy bullshiz.  

All that being said, I was lost a lot of the time, being myself very right brained and experiencing a lot of difficulty when it comes to left brain stuff.  But when lost I simply told myself ""It's just me - actually this material is making perfect sense and I'm just not getting it"".

In my own little, secret interpretation of the film, I decided it was sort of like a Bermuda Triangle type of situation but instead of planes in the air, it's people on the ground.",1

I thought it was perhaps a bit predictable but I also enjoyed it, in terms of the characterisation and I liked the musical score side to it, which wasn't overdone. The camerawork is decent too. Its not what I'd call great but it is relatively good, yes. It is also surprisingly thought provoking, although for some people it may seem a little slow plot wise. An intriguing film, yes, I'd recommend it.",1

7534,"Slow to engage, once it does start to engage it doesn't quite fully come together but it comes together enough... and then the end is a tad disappointing, but it does at least feel like it was a journey.  Average Lovercraftian horror, at best... I feel like I missed something here because I really should have liked it more, especially with the audience and critics scores.",0

7536,"If there was ever a film that was elevated by the final scene, 'Foxtrot' is it.  Four countries collaborated to make it, but it's an Israeli picture in Hebrew.  This is such a slow burn I had to rewatch a few scenes as the movie lost me a couple times in how it floats from time period to time period.  The film's disjointed nature initially struck me as a poor choice, but as I sit here this film keeps finding a way back into my mind.  The last scene is a culmination of so many things.  This may be a tough one to stay with, but if you do it's to your benefit.  Final Score: 7/10",1

Some may call it propaganda, but I would call it a movie about an importance of human's life. I don't know who any of these actors are, but they are doing a really good job to express their emotions and to make the viewer believe in what they are saying and what they are doing. A great story about surviving the loss of a child. Besides the operator's job not being outstanding, it is good. The soundtrack in such a movie is something that doesn't matter, as only thing that matters is the dialogue, which in this movie is very very well written. I recommend to watch this movie for a watch to anyone who is a fan of drama genre, likes thought provoking movies and is bored of Hollywood cinema. I rarely find foreign language films so entertaining, an absolute 10/10.",1

The story is beset with ripples and effects that come together in a nicely well thought out plot. The raw edge of emotions at home are a sharp contrast to the mundane routine of soldiers life. Acting is well done and characters seem appropriately cast. This movie will catch the eye of most if not all professional critics and most genpop who would be interested in foreign films.

7544,"""Foxtrot"" is a gorgeous piece of cinema smartly structured in three sections, and all of them are real, powerful and hauntingly beautiful. A film that dances with dramatic moments and something like magic realism. One of those film that you are bound to remember for a long time after viewing. In other words: a masterpiece.",1
7545,"A fascinating political allegory 

Part satirical allegory, part surrealist indictment, Foxtrot finds writer/director Samuel Maoz working with similar themes as he did in Lebanon (2009), especially the ridiculous nature of war and the meaninglessness of giving one's life in the service of one's country. However, whereas Lebanon was set entirely in a Centurion tank, Foxtrot expands Moaz's thematic concerns to take in the grief and anguish of those who have lost children to military service. Much like Lebanon, Foxtrot is an intensely political film, and much like Lebanon, it has met with controversy in Israel, where it has been accused of slandering the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As aesthetically impressive as it is politically divisive, the film is a savage condemnation of both a national psyche and a military mindset that trades on the most binary of them-versus-us dichotomies.

Divided into three distinct sections, the film tells the story of Michael Feldman (a superb Lior Ashkenazi), who learns that his son Jonathan, a conscript in the IDF, has been killed ""in the line of duty"", only to learn several hours later that a mistake had been made and Jonathan is alive and well. The film then jumps several days back to a forlorn desert checkpoint on Israel's northern border (codename Foxtrot) manned by a group of wet-behind-the-ears soldiers, including Jonathan (Yonaton Shiray). The most action the group see is raising the barrier to let a camel amble through and checking the IDs of the few Palestinians who pass by. Without spoiling anything, the third section, which is kind of an extended coda, then returns to the Feldman apartment six months after the opening scenes.

In Foxtrot, Maoz uses allegory to deconstruct Israeli national myths. Interrogating what he sees as a culture of denial born from a reluctance to deal with the morality and sustainability of being an occupying force, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the metaphor of the foxtrot - a dance where no matter where you go, if you follow the steps correctly, you end up back at the starting point. Maoz is suggesting that without taking great care, countries will repeat the errors of the past, ending up exactly where they once were. Speaking to the Globe and Mail, Maoz explains, ""Foxtrot deals with the open wound or bleeding soul of Israeli society. We dance the foxtrot; each generation tries to dance it differently but we all end up at the same starting point.""

In a more concrete sense, in a scene at Foxtrot, the film examines the casual sadism and unspoken racism that can arise from serving in the armed forces of a country perpetually at war. Making a Palestinian couple stand in the pouring rain whilst their antiquated computer checks the couple's IDs, the soldiers don't care that they couple are dressed for a formal night, or that by the time they are cleared, their clothes are destroyed, as is her hair, and makeup. The scene is brilliantly staged, agonisingly realistic, and takes place in real-time, with Maoz concentrating on the couple looking at one another across the roof of the car, conveying agonised helplessness, compromised innocence, and, most saliently, abject humiliation. It's a masterclass in dialogue-free storytelling, and deeply political storytelling at that.

Aesthetically, Maoz shoots each of the three sections differently; the first is restrictive, trapping us in the confined headspace of the Feldmans, with the intense emotionality constantly threatening to boil over; the vast wide-open vistas of the second part contrast sharply with the confinement of the first, with the entire section threaded through with surrealism; the third section is darker than the others (in a literal sense), with a stark visual design that emphasises only those elements that are important to the scene. The Feldman apartment itself is extremely angular, and although it's very spacious, cinematographer Giora Bejach shoots it in such a way as to appear oppressively box-like.

Foxtrot won't be for everyone. Some will take issue with the pacing (which, it has to be said, is extremely languid), some with the allegorical nature of the story, some with the film's politics. For everyone else, however, this is a brilliantly realised tragedy, dealing with the randomness of pain and loss in a country refusing to recognise its past. Critiquing the xenophobic mindset that has crept into the Israeli zeitgeist, Maoz has been accused of making an ""anti-Israel narrative."" On the contrary, he is pleading with his country to change its ways, or it will repeat the errors of history. This is the act of a man who loves his country deeply, but who can see its flaws.",1

The shots of everything, angels and stuff, just seem different and peaks a person, like me's, interest. This is one the those movies that really wanna tell a story.

I don't want to watch Pennywise gorily murder children. I want a good horror movie that scares without the insane violence. And this movie does just that.

Its worth hanging around for the final scene, which I thought was quite satisfying. It certainly highlights how horrendous the KKK are, for their vile views and some of the nonsense their followers believe. I'd hope those who support such organisations wouldn't find anything positive about them when watching such a film but then, who knows these days frankly. I thought it was a good film as a piece of social commentary certainly - quite how the main character managed not to lose his what-not when conversing with members of the local 'Klan' is, quite frankly, beyond me. I would recommend this film, yes.

This works and was fun and sad and worth your time.  Hubby: 8.8 Wife: 9.0 Average: 8.9/10",1
7579,"A rudimentary bio-doc that isn't very insightful, but which features excellent archival material

Directed by Marina Zenovich, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind is a rudimentary bio-doc that fails to live up to its subtitle. It asks questions about Williams, gives him a platform, marvels at his on-stage energy, but never manages to elucidate much in the way of psychological insight. Perhaps a little too respectful of her subject, Zenovich avoids hagiography, but so too does she gloss over some of the darker aspects, although it's certainly laudable that she refuses to allow the manner of his death become the defining moment of his life. What the film does have going for it, however, is the archival footage, which shows Williams at the height of his powers. And, ultimately, the quality of this footage offsets the film's failure to offer a deep dive into his thought-processes.

Featuring interviews with people such as Billy Crystal, Steve Martin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Pam Dawber, the film includes clips from Williams's 1986 performance at the Met Opera House; the outtakes from his improvisations explaining the uses of a stick during a 1991 appearance on Sesame Street; and his improvised ""acceptance speech"" at the 2003 Critics Choice Awards, where he was nominated for Best Actor alongside Jack Nicholson and Daniel Day-Lewis, and the result was a draw between Nicholson and Day-Lewis (""it's been a wonderful evening for me, to walk away with nothing; coming here with no expectations, leaving here with no expectations. It's pretty much been a Buddhist evening for me"").

From a biographical perspective, the film details such events as his 1973 scholarship to Juilliard, where he and Christopher Reeve were the only students selected by John Houseman to join the Advanced Program; how the death of John Belushi led to Williams getting clean;  his celebrated appearance alongside Steve Martin in Mike Nichols's 1988 production of Waiting for Godot at the Lincoln Centre; checking himself into rehab in 2014 to treat his remerging alcoholism; his diagnosis with early stage Parkinson's; and ultimately, his suicide.

Also touched on is that his father was a very stern man, and it was when a young Williams saw him laugh at Jonathan Winters, that he first began to consider a career in comedy. Also interesting is how he changed the manner in which sitcoms were shot. When he started on Mork & Mindy in 1978, all American sitcoms were shot with a three-camera set-up (one for the wide shot, the others for close-ups). However, due to his unpredictability, he would rarely stick to his marks, making it impossible for close-ups, as the operators never knew where he was going to go. And so, the show's executive producer Garry Marshall introduced a fourth camera, whose sole purview was to follow Williams.

The use of audio interviews with Williams, which act as narration, see him more contemplative; ""I don't tell jokes, I use characters as a vehicle for me. I seldom just talk as myself."" This is, of course, a key admission, and is one of the main themes of the film – the private man hiding behind the public entertainer. However, the film fails to explore this dissonance; it's touched on a few times, but it's never examined in any detail. Indeed, for a film which literally invites the audience into the subject's mind, there's very little of any psychological worth.

Another problem is Zenovich's unwillingness to depict some of the darker aspects of his life. Lip-service is given to some of it, but nothing more (Elayne Boosler talks about being his girlfriend whilst giving her blessing for him to be with other women; Billy Crystal explains that he was addicted to audience reaction; Steve Martin discusses how difficult he found sobriety). However, apart from these brief moments, Zenovich never examines any of the issues thrown up. And as much as they are glossed over, there's nothing at all on Dawber's claim that Williams fondled her and exposed himself to her on the set of Mork & Mindy, even if only to reiterate that she was never offended or threatened.

The film's structure is also a little unusual, focusing on his rise in the 70s and 80s and the last few years of his life, without spending a huge amount of time looking at the intervening years. Because of this, when his 2014 suicide comes, it feels very abrupt.

The argument could be made that Williams was notoriously difficult to know even in real life, hence we shouldn't expect a documentary to lay him bare, but the fact is that Zenovich doesn't really try. And I can't help but think that presenting some of the darker times would have been a more truthful approach; it wouldn't have tarnished his legacy, but it would have made for a deeper film. In the end, Williams was consumed by his demons, but Come Inside My Mind sidelines those same demons as much as possible, hoping, perhaps, that we remember the laughter, without dwelling on the sadness.",1

7581,"It's an excellent movie that will be a treasure for his fans.  It goes through his life from a kid right up til the end.  It did a great job of showing his earliest exploits and interviewed the people he worked with.  It followed that up by showing clips of his best roles/characters in movies as well as clips from his stand-up specials.  It was great to hear intimate stories about him from his close friends.  It really painted a picture of who he truly was.  My only complaint was that they sort of rushed through his death.

It chronicles the 1917 Bisbee Deportation, 100 years later.  This gets a little goofy as the actors often give backgrounds of themselves.  Some may call this more of a reenactment, but it's small town theatre acting.  There is a lot of information here, but I wanted to know in great detail about the deportations of Americans to other states.  Can anyone imagine that this happened 100 years ago.  Remarkable.  There are bizarre musical numbers which are a gimmick.  It's hard to know if it's the documentarians who are paying the actors or if it's the city.

Vitali is a shell of who he was, and the psychology of his sacrifice is what this excellent documentary is ultimately about.",1
7611,"Filmworker is a documentary by Tony Zierra based on the life and career of Stanley Kubrickâ(TM)s right hand man: Leon Vitali.

Vitali had made a name for himself in British film and Television, with no shortage of job offers. On being selected for the role of Lord Bullingdon in Barry Lyndon, the 27 year old was star struck at meeting the maverick director. Meanwhile Kubrick saw something in Vitali and created a space for him to fill. Though this began with the role in the film, it soon expanded to become much more than that.

Incredible that as much as Kubrick offered an opportunity to the young actor, Vitali felt that he should take such a leap into devoting his time to the director. The youngest of four, losing his father while still in primary school must have been enormously heartbreaking, and his desire to become Kubrickâ(TM)s protege suggests that there was a need in his life for that type of dynamic. However, it is staggering to discover the lengths he went to to be of service to Kubrick â"" dogsbody; messenger; editor; bodyguard; personal attendant, on call 24/7. Herein lies the reason he would state â~Filmworkerâ(TM) as his job title. He saw himself in service not to Stanley Kubrick, but to the films of Stanley Kubrick â"" an abstract concept. Vitali witnessed the genius of the director, and devoted his whole career to seeing it realised.

Filmworker maintains a good balance between archival footage and talking heads, with much of the narrative coming directly from Vitali. Kubrick fans will enjoy various behind the scenes disclosures, and although there are no huge surprises, it is pleasing to hear Vitaliâ(TM)s memories of events in vivid detail. Equally, newcomers to the directorâ(TM)s work will not be put off by too much insider jargon or unnecessary spoilers.

For the time since Kubrickâ(TM)s death in 1999 Vitali has existed as custodian of what remains. His passion never extinguished, although more than a few have tried to snuff it out. He has overseen 4k reproductions of the Kubrick back catalogue while some have sought to leave him out of the picture entirely (see Kubrick retrospective).

The unanswerable question that hangs over the whole documentary is this: How did Kubrick view his relationship with Vitali? To play such an important part in the making of iconic films such as The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, yet be left struggling to get by after the directorâ(TM)s death certainly gives pause.",1

7625,"This is a fascinating documentary. Its one of those stories whereby the truth seems stranger than fiction, you could say. Its fascinating mainly because its true.

If your interested in human nature and the impacts of adoption on siblings separated at birth, then I would highly recommend watching this. However, it did leave me with a number of unanswered questions, which it would seem no-one could answer due to what we discover during the film. I'll say no more so as not to spoil it for anyone but if you don't like unanswered questions, then this may not be for you but otherwise its a thought provoking, intriguing watch.",1
7626,"Is it nature or nuture? That is a question that philosophers have pondered for years. In the 60s, psychologists in America began conducting experiments with unwanted identical twins to gather more evidence. 

This documentary tells the story of 3 identical twins who were separated at birth and miraculously reunited. The footage of their absolute joy as young men discovering they had a double and then a treble is heartwarming. The media caught onto the story and the boys became overnight sensations.

Things take a darker twist when they realise they were all part of an experiment. I can see why it would hurt but I don't think the researchers motives are that bad. The boys would have been split up anyway and the researches didn't do much to cause harm.

The boys were placed in various backgrounds with a view to seeing how they would develop. Initially they seemed to be extremely similar based on manerisms and even smoking the same cigarettes. They similarities are likely physical and also coincidental and not that important. As it develops and they get to know each other the differences in their personalities become more apparent.

It transpires that a father was a disciplinarian who didn't share much bond with his son. That caused the son to suffer from depressive episodes and was enjoyed the reassurance and looked for stronger connections with other people including his new found brothers.

An interesting case study with a very human story and some moral issues for us to debate. The findings though are that nurture play a more defining part in the development of our personalities.",1

As if that weren't incredible enough, it transpires that they were separated as part of a decidedly unethical social experiment.
The unbelievable story is told in a fairly standard documentary style which allows the individuals involved to speak for themselves in archive and contemporary footage. 
This tale has some dark, tragic and upsetting aspects as we learn of the struggles that the brothers had upon their reunion and newly found celebrity status as they tried, and in some cases failed, to reconcile the events of their past.",1

7636,"After watching the film, which I enjoyed immensely, I reviewed the history surrounding the events portrayed in the movie and was surprised to find out most of the major plot points were actual events. While it seems like The Three Stooges (with prisons and executions), it's not far from the reality of the events surrounding Stalin's death and the ensuing power struggle. I don't want to include any spoilers, but even the scenes about finding doctors to care for Stalin were based on actual events, as were many others.",1

Vor allem ist die Leistung der Darsteller zu erwähnen. Aber wird der Film den vielen Opfer des stalinistischen Terrors gerecht?",0
7644,"This is an amusing watch - not entirely laugh out loud style but there's certainly an element of farce present. The many government worker type characters are somewhat comical but in a toned down sort of a way. The plot is pretty ludicrous but I found it really quite watchable and it was certainly entertaining regardless. Its fair to say that this is very much a political satire, one that features a lot of petty squabbling and I imagine it didn't go down well (plot wise) in certain parts of the world but thats easily guessed. I found the jerky/wobbly camerawork a bit frustrating and it relies on old stereotypes of the Russians, with scenes in a Siberian jail and so on. I like that its such an obvious send up of power and authority in such a powerful and feared part of the world. Its somehow amusing to see the 'powers that be' or those who worked for them, to be faced with having to create their new hierarchy, to see them struggle to build their future from whats left.",0
7645,"Maybe i don't understand the movie, but i think a little bit boring. The photography is amazing, and the historical clipping is precise. I found the story very simple, something that does not hold us during the entire plot.",1
7646,The best international movie ever made! With the best cinematography ever done in a movie!,1
7647,"Une réalisation absolument remarquable, qui offre une approche rafraîchissante du cinéma. J'ai beaucoup apprécié les plans larges, pivotant doucement ; cela donne moins la sensation d'étouffer, tout en se servant intelligemment de l'espace scénographique. Pour qui aime le cinéma à l'ancienne, plus statique et soucieux du détail, Roma est un régal. L'absence de couleurs apporte un cachet artistique à l'œuvre, et focalise l'attention du téléspectateur sur la forme des décors et le jeu des acteurs. 

Sur ce sujet, Yalitza Aparicio, que je ne connaissais pas avant de voir ce film, crève l'écran. Son interprétation, pourtant avare en lignes de dialogue, transmet tout par le visage ; c'est encore plus impressionnant lors de la scène de l'accouchement, qui, en plus de déchirer le cœur, montre tout le spectre de ses émotions.",1

7653,Beautiful slice of life tale. Both cute and heartwarming and quietly heartbreakingly tragic and balances both in a way that always manages to feel real and honest. Definitely slow paced but each shot is so beautifully framed that I barely felt the long running time. Definitely have to be in a patient contemplative mood to enjoy but thankfully I was and it really worked for me! Great stuff!,1
7654,"This is a vibrant (despite the fact its shot entirely in black and white, which would otherwise give it more of a classical feel) depiction of domestic life in Mexico in the 1970s . I liked the characters, the way they interacted, particularly the childrens enthusiasm, that made me smile.

This film contains both sadness and hope, at different times. At times the camerawork was quite floaty and could almost make you dizzy as it panned around a large communal area and at other times, the camera appears to be hidden at the back of the room or place the scene is set in, as if the characters are being spied on. It concentrates on both families and community - in some scenes, we see some quite pretty landscape panoramas and in others we're peering out at domestic settings. There are some interesting lines of dialogue, such as 'remember, the mind is the motor for the physical'. Its quite a thought provoking watch and I found it quite tense and gripping towards the end.

I'd certainly say its a memorable film - if your keen on world cinema then its well worth a watch, in my opinion.",1
7655,"There is a distinct and saddening lack of documentaries around World War 1 that covers not the events of the conflict, but the people involved in it. ""They Shall Not Grow Old"", however, covers only the experiences of the common British soldiers who fought in it. It does not waste time with detailing any battle or engagement, instead giving a broad overview perspective of the soldiers who fought and lived through the experience. Unlike many of the documentaries that detail something regarding the Second World War, and usually some leading hero or heroes in an engagement, there are no heroes in this documentary, which brings the entirety of the film to a ground level, one where you WILL, not can, sympathize and emphasize with the soldiers as they recount the tragedy, loss, victories, and joys of the war in all of their accounts and the scenes of death, dismay, and hopelessness shown throughout. It is a beautifully moving documentary, and I cannot recommend watching it enough.",1

The film is very innovative, and offers a completely different look into the first World War. Overall, director Peter Jackson once again gives it his absolute all to give the brave soldiers the honor and respect that they deserve.",1
7661,Interesting accounts of what it was like to be in the trenches during WW1.,1
7662,"The fascinating technical achievment put in ""They shall not grow old"" is only overshadowed by the emotional impact caused by the imagery and the testimonials in the background that are used as a captivating tribute for the sacrifice of a generation and, also, as a S.O.S call for help to end the stupidity of war.",1
7663,"A remarkable fusion of visual imagery and spoken word. The movie takes the old archive film from the Great War which was black and white and rather jerky, and colourises it and remasters the motion to give it much more natural pace and fluidity. This needs to be emphasized, it is not just that the old film has been colourized, it is the work to correct motion effects that makes such a transformation. And by using tapes of veterans articulating their own memories and thoughts it has an authenticity and balance that very few films about the Great War can match. There is an emotional power which makes for compelling viewing and a very powerful experience. Forget polemics, re-fighting old wars and making history fit modern political issues, this simply gives a voice to those who fought and is all the better for it. Cannot be recommended highly enough.",1

It's been described as funny but I would describe it has having occasional satire. It's mostly depressing and suitable if you're looking for some feel-good escapism. But so enlightening. I had no idea witch-camps exist. The ribbons are a just a visual metaphor. I got more out of this film by googling and reading reviews before watching it, I'm glad I did.",1
7671,"I Am Not a Witch lacks focus and it should have been better paced, but it's very well directed by Rungano Nyoni, it's so well shot and it offers a great glimpse into the worst tendencies of African culture. The movie's at its best when mixing comedy and tragedy as it is both very heartbreaking and also quite amusing at times.",1
7672,"This is the first feature of Zambian-born Welsh director Rungano Nyoni.  It takes place in Zambia.  I have never been there and the events it depicts seem very farfetched but some googling suggests that women may still be accused of witchcraft in this country.  The film tells the story of Shula (Maggie Mulubwa), a young girl who may be an orphan and who is convicted of this crime because of circumstantial evidence (what else could there be?).  She is then sent to a âwitch campâ? where a large group of older women, all tethered to gigantic spools by long white ribbons, live and work.  They entertain tourists but also perform manual labour on a farm.  The group welcomes Shula and you sense that they could be and would be a set of surrogate mothers for her.  But instead she becomes a sort of diviner for local politician Mr. Banda (Henry B.J. Phiri) who uses her at line-ups to point out thieves and other criminals (using supernatural means, of course), rewarding her (and the camp) with booze and other gifts.  Nyoni leaves it up-in-the-air as to whether Shula really can I.D. the perps.  Indeed, there is some wry comedy at work here, particularly in the depiction of Mr. Banda who seems rather hapless but may also be an exploiter. Later he goes on TV to sell âShulaâ(TM)s eggsâ?, presumably magical, and tries to sell her guarantee of rain to a local White farmer.  Obviously, the mistreatment of women and their exploitation is a central theme of the film.  Shula soon laments that she ever allowed herself to be called a witch and felt that she should have taken the option of becoming a goat instead (by cutting the ribbon), even if the goat would be killed and eaten.  It doesnâ(TM)t rain, casting some doubt on witchcraftâ(TM)s ability but this may be due to Shulaâ(TM)s recalcitrance.  Later, however, it seems perhaps that Shula really does make it rain (through self-sacrifice or malice by some third party).  I had to watch the ending a couple of times and Iâ(TM)m still not sure I fully grasp what happened.  Of course, the ambiguous and mysterious aspect of events in Zambia leave room for interpretation â"" and for such bizarre practices to continue (if indeed they still do).  Iâ(TM)ll be interested to see what this director does next.",1
7673,"This is a striking, haunting, sometimes funny and ultimately moving debut film from Welsh-Zambian writer-director Rungano Nyoni. A young girl finds herself accused of being the witch who caused a woman to drop her pale of water; as a result she finds herself living with other so-called witches, all older women. She, like all of them, has a giant bobbin of white ribbon attached to her wherever she goes  - this controls all the accused, having been told they will turn into a goat should they break it and try to free themselves. A government minister knows a money-maker when he sees one, and uses the young girl as a kind of travelling show, predicting rain and identifying accused thieves. 

Part satire, part feminist critique of patriarchy, part reflection on childhood, this film is never polemical but no less the powerful for it. The brilliant cinematography reminded me of 12 Years A Slave; though a very different film, this film shares the Oscar winner's long, lingering shots asking us - especially the white, Western observer, just what it is we are waiting or expecting to see. White characters are few and far between, and when they do surface, they're either bemused or excruciatingly patronising. The film feels careful and real; the director spent time in Ghana, living in official 'witch camps'; it's odd to discover, then, that the white ribbons are her own invention. They do make for some striking visual statements against the greys and browns of the landscape, but they may be a visual metaphor too far. They play a key role in the film's abrupt, potentially ambiguous ending which may frustrate or move in equal measure, a clever use of sound over the closing shot and credits emphasising that this is no rationalist critique of African superstition. 

There is more - much more - to come from this young film-maker, which makes such a startling and confident debut all the more exciting, sacrificing little in tone, vision or aesthetic. As she does so, she runs the risk fo alienating the more casual Western viewer. But lauded at film festivals, she is clearly already an important and emerging voice with a flair for weaving gentle humour alongside subtle power.",1
7674,I had to see this film twice.  The plotline was so unexpected.  The characters are so authentic and the scenery is gorgeous.  A must see film of life on this earth. The artistry of this film is hauntingly beautifully magically expressed via this piece of art.,1

It is acted and shot with an authenticity rarely found in modern movies. You can't help but sympathize with a young man who has taken his last curtain call in the rodeo arena, and has no choice but to find meaning in his life in other ways.

Touching. Sad. Hopeful. Outstanding.",1

Definitely one for my hot list of films well worth watching . Great movie and standout cast ..one not to missed!",1
7688,"I really enjoyed this film. I liked the sound of the hooves on the ground - the rustling of the grass and the crickets, plus, of course, the ocassional great landscape panoramic type shots, including some pretty sunsets. I imagine it looked really quite impressive on the big screen - its certainly atmospheric in any case.

Its one of those films in which at times the lack of dialogue makes it stand out - in which its whats not said that perhaps means, or counts, more than what is. In that sense its about isolation and I appreciated that aspect of it.

I thought Brady Jandreau did good portraying the main character,  Brady Blackburn - he's quite facially expressive and its relatively easy to tell, or guess, what he may be thinking at any time. Also his pure love of rodeo, of being a cowboy etc. comes across quite genuinely. His sister, Lilly, is quite clearly developmentally challenged (if thats an acceptable phrase to use these days?) and I thought it was quite touching how he interacts with her. The film is based on a true story, that of the actor Brady Jandreau, which gives it even more meaning and substance, I feel. There's a Q&A on the Blu-Ray of this film, in which the actor talks about his experience.

There is a lot of love and compassion as well as determinism expressed, visually if not verbally. Its also about identity including masculinity. It captures exhilaration quite well, I felt, with a good use of music - a moody instrumental piece played at the end. 

I very much enjoyed this film and so I would definitely recommend it.",1
7689,"Chloe Zhao's The Rider tells the story of Brady Jandreau (playing himself), a rodeo rider and horse trainer who suffers a catastrophic head injury and is forced to reevaluate his dreams and rebuild his life.  It's a pensive and brooding film, inhabited with characters who appear to live lives of quiet desperation.  The Rider is filled with beautiful cinematography, a series of nicely composed panoramic shots of the striking South Dakota landscape. While Brady Jandreau is solid in the lead role and the non-professional cast give the movie a sense of authenticity, there are times when the acting seems wooden, which is perfectly understandable but does detract from the impact of some scenes.  Beyond that, it's hard to find fault with this unique independent film.",1

I would say it's pretty average, however, the book is a great alternative and for someone who read the book first if you're thinking about watching the movie, read the book. The movie leaves out a lot of the book's important scenes and changes the ending pretty drastically.

I felt one or two parts of the plot were predictable and its not the most impactful film I've ever seen but maybe to expect that would be expecting a bit much(?!).

7702,"The Hate You Give (C+)
Definitely has some heavy hitting themes that make you think about multiple perspectives on ratial issues. The movie was the best when it was tackling subjects about all sides of police brutality and how others think they know what people are going through when they really don't. It made me think more about how I approach considering what other races have been through. 
The movie does fall into a lot of problems that other young adult movies do. It felt very cheesy in some scenes when there was genuine emotion that was supposed to be felt. The acting was just okay and I feel if it was elevated a few degrees more than the movie would had as big of an impact as the creators were hoping. The film isn't bad at all but doesn't tao into too many new areas as far as young adult innovation goes. I had some moments during this film where I really did feel strong emotions and a deep understanding for what the characters were going through but they were often cut too quick. If the movie could have paced itself a little differently and really made us hold onto moments longer like when Khalil di d it would have done more for me. The highschools rama aspects had an extra little element in them with the focus being on racial equality but characters emotional moments didn't have quite the punch I would've hoped for. 
Overall this is a very enjoyable movie and one that I think everyone should watch. It makes you think more about important issues that a lot of people have become far too polarized on.",0

The reason I gave this movie 4 stars are, the subject matter, the way it is portrayed and shown. This movie had truly my hamsters spinning and drew me in from start to finish. When I first started to watch the beginning, I almost changed channel because I felt it was just another movie that used ""racism"" as a reason to be. But I quickly changed my mind and was drawn in within the first few mins and in the end, was happy I did so. This was a ""Powerful and vulnerable"" movie at the same time. Meaning that it was powerful in showing the truth in our times and in the same instant, showing how vulnerable the black community is in regards to prejudice and all it entails. If I was to continue my critique of this movie, I'd end up writing a book instead of a review. So, I'll just say and encourage everyone/anyone to watch this movie as it is well worth your time. And I guaranty you, that it will leave you thinking on many many issues that you've heard and/or witnessed in your lifetime from Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and all others who tried to eradicate racism in their own way, from Abraham Lincoln and everyone else in between up to this day.",1

I loved how Tom Cruise managed it, to get Henry Cavill into the team and of course, Simon Pegg was the hero of the hearts - just as always.
There's only one thing I was sad about: William Brandt wasn't there. I know, it has something to do with Jeremy Renner and the fact, that he had to play in the Avengers instead. But still, I missed the sarcasm.

Rebuilding Oren

Summary

Remarkable film about the meeting of two mournings: that of the German lover of an Israeli engineer and that of his widow. Sober, subtle, intense and moving.




Review:

Thomas (Tim Kalkhof) is a pastry chef who runs his own café (Konditorei) in Berlin. He strikes up a relationship with Oren (Royal Miller), a married Israeli engineer with a daughter and they see each other every time Oren travels to Berlin. After a long absence from the latter, Thomas learns that his lover has passed away and decides to travel to Jerusalem to connect with his surroundings.

The film by Ofir Raul Greizer slowly and subtly builds what constitutes a meeting of two mournings: that of Thomas, who seeks to recover (and rebuild) Oren through everything that was his life in Jerusalem and that of his widow Anat (Sarah Adler), who must move on to her newly opened cafe, where Thomas will end up working. The encounter between the two first makes one fear a perverse and even fetishistic plot on the part of Thomas, but the evolution of the story becomes deeper and more comprehensive, leading both characters to deep rethinking. Some normative religious questions also arise about this type of business and family members who are the custodians of this tradition. It is also - and nothing less - the meeting between a German and an Israeli.

It is very interesting and moving to follow the transformations of both characters: a Thomas with his Germanic inscrutability and an enterprising Anat, perhaps the most interesting character, in a wonderful performance of Sarah Adler - a sort of Israeli Charlotte Gainsbourg - in a film that  remembers for moments for its veiled intensity, to the also Israeli The Kindergarten Teacher.


Reconstruyendo a Oren

Sumario

Notable película sobre el encuentro de dos duelos: el del amante alemán de un ingeniero israelí y el de su viuda. Sobria, sutil, intensa y conmovedora.




Reseña:


Thomas (Tim Kalkhof) es un repostero que maneja su propia cafetería (Konditorei) en Berlín. Entabla una relación con Oren (Royal Miller), un ingeniero israelí casado y con una hija y se ven cada vez que Oren viaja a Berlín. Luego de una larga ausencia de este último, Thomas se entera que su amante ha fallecido y decide viajar a Jerusalén para conectarse con su entorno.

La película de Ofir Raul Greizer va construyendo lenta y sutilmente lo que constituye un encuentro de dos duelos: el de Thomas, que busca recuperar (y reconstruir) a Oren a través de todo lo que fuera su vida en Jerusalén y el de su viuda Anat (Sarah Adler), que debe seguir adelante con su recién abierto café, donde Thomas terminará trabajando. El encuentro entre ambos primero hace temer una trama perversa y hasta fetichista por parte de Thomas, pero la evolución de la historia se vuelve más profunda e integral, llevando a ambos personajes a profundos replanteos. También surgen algunas cuestiones religiosas normativas sobre ese tipo de comercios y familiares que se erigen en custodios de esa tradición. Se trata, además -y nada menos- del encuentro entre un alemán y una israelí.

Resulta muy interesante y conmovedor seguir las transformaciones de ambos personajes: un Thomas con su inescrutabilidad germánica y una emprendedora Anat, acaso el personaje más interesante, en una interpretación maravillosa de Sarah Adler -una suerte de Charlotte Gainsbourg israelí- en una película que recuerda por momentos por su asordinada intensidad, a la también israelí La maestra de jardín.",1
7742,"This is one hell of a character study. It is amazing directed, tremendously well-acted, and has a melancholic cinematography. I was very much moved by the two leads, both showcased a lot of emotions with just bare-minimum dialogues. Almost perfect to me!",1

7744,"Subtle, beautifully sad and depressing story",1
7745,"A fantastic film with terrific acting by Tim Kalkhof and Sarah Adler, especially.  The entire cast was wonderful as well.  The character of Thomas is relatable, and the audience feels for him with what happens to him throughout the movie.  It's a wonderful and refreshing story.",1

7752,"My opinion---

With: ""I'll dance if I want to,"" Palestinian Maysaloun Hamoud filmed a movie full of life and modesty about the lives of three young Arab women in Tel Aviv. The movie is the symbolic of a generation struggling to replace the enormous taboo traditions that surround the lights of freedom, facing a conformist and intolerant society. The movie itself is a success because in addition to all the obstacles they may encounter, the movie does not fall into the disrespectful because it is filmed with heaps and feelings and the three young people interpret their role with great skill.",1
7753,"It is a film about modern, young Palestinian women living in Tel Aviv and their battle with their conservative, traditional, male dominated culture. It offers lots to think about. A really good film. Terrific actors.",1
7754,One of my favorite movies.  So beautifully done and the women were superb!,1

The champ will not only gain notoriety, and $75,000, but also a golden ticket to any university.  Here we follow some kids from various parts on the world on their quest.  It's tied in well as contestants and past winners act as talking heads for a fast moving flick.  Hubby thought it could have been edited a bit more precisely, but aside from that there were no complaints.  You'll find it hard to root for everyone, and that's the way it should be.  Wife: 8.8/Hubby 7.3:  Average Final Score: 8.05",1

7765,"GO SEE this wonderful movie! You will love these kids and want to see every one of them succeed! You will enjoy getting to know them, their stories and enough about their projects and theories to know it is over your head and will realize their incredible intelligence, focus and determination!  Don't ask your kids if they want to go see it - just take them!  All will be entertained and inspired!!  I only wish they had made 100 more introducing us to more of these fabulous people!!!!",1

It joyously weaves the lives of high schoolers from around the world as they prepare with all of their might for the glory of winning and placing at the world science fair.  The brilliant minds provide humor, moments of pride, and an overall hopeful outlook on the future.  The theater was full of outright laughter eclipsed by a cheerful standup applause for the film maker and characters on screen.  If the world's greatest problems were left to be solved by these young brilliant minds, perhaps it's a world that has no limits.  This film will uplift your hearts and minds and anyone with kids should share this movie as staple viewing.  Please share this movie at high schools around the world as science indeed can be cool and hip.  Let the science fair begin!",1
7768,"A very entertaining documentary that portrays the human element of brilliant youth throughout the world who are aspiring scientifically of improving the world.

Its a pretty compelling watch.",1
7771,"The story of Alex Honnold, the man who climbed more than 900 meters without ropes or safety equipment. The camera team rounds off an amazing photograph, causing the documented milestone to evoke the risk and how insurmountable it was. Amazing and shocking.",1

7775,"Why all people make a hero from this guy? All he do - he had a trauma in his brain, that changed his brain's opinion of many things. He just repeats the same thing - keep climbing at the same mountain over  and over for years because his brain want to do same things. 
Ok, he is good climber. Ok, he is strange. Ok,he tried make some money by risking his life. That's all that i had to admit, no more, i mean if i'll do some strange wierdo thing that almost nobody want to do everyone gonna admire me too? haha Nonsense.

7776,"Yosemite is one of the few places on earth I've visited that has left me genuinely speechless at the scale and nature of its beauty. The route into the park, that leads you through forest, round a corner after which El Capitan hoves into view, was the first wordless moment. It's staggering, overwhelming, and intimidating. Look long and close enough and you see the headlamps, ropes, tents and people that mark the face. It's easy to see how it gets under your skin. This excellent documentary does a really good job of communicating that - as well as the ethical dilemmas of filming a project that may well kill the participant, also gradually revealing the strange family dynamics that make up the past of a person who chooses this course in life, and the inherent selfishness required to live like this. It's also stunningly shot - some of the most vertiginous footage ever captured, surely, as well as doing justice to the sheer beauty of Yosemite. Awe-inspiring.",1
7777,Perhaps one of the best documentaries I've ever seen,1
7778,"To be honest, my expectations were high, but I was bored the whole time, except when he finally started his climb.",0
7779,"Free Solo does a fantastic job of humanising Alex and his peers. This only builds the tension as the ultimate ascent of El Capitan approaches. The possibility of death is very real and is a reality that Alex's friends, loved ones and camera crew have to be ready for. 

Breathtaking cinematography for one of the most impressive sporting achievements you will ever witness.",1
7780,The best acting performance from Richard E. Grant!,1
7781,"McCarthy and Grant are fabulous. The film centers on fraud, but ultimately tells a painful story about friendship and loneliness.",1
7782,"This isn't the sort of film that brings massive laugh out loud moments but I found it certainly made me chuckle at times, none the less and I like the rebellious, mischevious aspect of both of the main characters. Its an interesting story and its based on a true story I believe too, which is something I appreciate - im a sucker for a true life story, even if said story is about a writer unable to sell their story (if you follow). The performances are good, especially that of Melissa McCarthy, she gives a stellar performance I thought and there is an emotional rawness towards the end of the film that I appreciated, plus some information about the true story is provided as the credits start to roll, which I liked, so due to all of this, I'd definitely recommend this film to others.",1
7783,"A beautifully tender comedic drama about one or two people whom on first contact seem to lack all human tenderness. Like another film by director Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood), it's far more insightful than the lightly comic tone initially suggests. Richard E. Grant is good; Melissa McCarthy is remarkable, investing her true life portrayal with nuance and depth. Like the Fred Rogers film, despite dealing with very different people, it gradually peels back the central character's personality until her core is revealed; that the viewer senses that core long before age apparently does is down to the excellence of the writing, performances and direction. It didn't move me the way …Neighbourhood did, perhaps because of the nature of the people involved; but it remains a very fine film.",1
7784,Poignant and funny - a rare combo. It is heartbreaking to watch Ms Israel navigate the twists and turns of her chaotic life and try to hold onto a semblance of dignity.  McCarthy is unbelievable.. probably her best performance. This one's for the discerning movie watcher. Dont miss if you are one.,1
7785,"Such a heartbreaking and beautiful story.  McCarthy and Grant give wonderful performances, you really feel the unique friendship and bond these two people must have formed.   McCarthy especially makes you see the humanity and sadness of Lee, rooting for her even while she's committing these crimes and pushing people away.  A great script, musical soundtrack and convincing look of 90s New York combine to bring about this compelling film.",1
7786,i hate melissa mccarthy,0
7787,"This was certainly a refreshing change of pace for Melissa McCarthy. I hope she does some more dramatic roles like this one because her all too familiar ""funny fat lady"" persona has really overstayed it's welcome, and the ""not so hot"" reviews of some of her recent projects certainly reflects that! This film was very well done and Melissa has great talent. I just wish she'd step outside of her bubble (no pun intended) and start tackling some different roles.",1

7791,"Holy ‘made for tv' fluff. What were you thinking, critics? Slow, dull, meandering story with only Laura Dern's decent showing to help. Someone cast Common in a role here, too. Dreadfully bad actor. Painful to watch him even try. Skip this drab HBO entry.",0

7795,"If this is what all these victims go through then this must be pure hell. In essential story that must be told. Bare, unsanitised, traumatizing, horrifying and a most brutal therapy some dare to go through. The film is extremely difficult to get through in a lot of areas throughout and unimaginable and unspeakably heinous to witness, but incredibly high marks for this director's bold, brave telling of her real life traumatic experiences.",1
7796,"Very difficult to watch especially during the sex scenes, which is the only reason i didnt gove it 5 stars. But definitely a must watch",1
7797,"RATING: A+  Director: Jennifer Fox
The Tale is an emotional drama based on a book that the Writer/Director/Producer wrote with 15 years. Laura Dern plays the adult version of Jennifer and she is a Tour de Force, really Oscar worthy. The young actress who plays the 13 year old version could be considered as the film's standout. The film has some disturbing scenes that will stick with you for days ( I watched it 4 days ago and I still think about it ). Fox's Screenplay and here Direction are cherishable and she could definitely have a future with Directing Features.",1
7798,Muddled storytelling. Laura Dern is the reason to see this.,0
7799,"Extremely unsatisfying and uncomfortable at times- as it should be. Brilliant cast and performance by Laura Dern, transcending from the conceptual to the unknown, travelling into the depths of the mind and the horror of child abuse. The Tale is a challenging story, seen through the eyes of both young and adult Jennifer as the roots of trauma reemerge.",1

7801,"An absolute must-see. Definitely filled with wonderful laughter, heart-warming laughter. But overall the tone of the whole ""film"", or documentary, whatever you want to call it, has left me feeling seriously haunted. There is an unexpected (but not at all surprising, come to think of it) deep and serious homage to Shakespeare. The film itself seems to be capturing the lives of these beautiful women vanishing into thin air (as Judi alludes to in a concluding recitation from the famous lines of Prospero), and it's both beautiful, endearing, inspiring, funny, and fun...but, at the same time tragic, frightening, depressing, and I guess humbling. We are the stuff but which dreams are made on -- Maggie hasn't even seen a single episode of Downton Abbey (she jokes she better make ""haste"" but it's obvious she never will). These wonderful women are so powerful, are so filled with magic, have done so much with their lives, and yet still here we witness their vanishing. And soon nothing will remain of them at all......except this and countless wonderful other films!! So the good news I guess is thank goodness some of it was captured. Though I suppose ultimately even all that will be forgotten, too.",1
7802,"Adorei, divertido espontâneo, gerou mais entretenimento do que eu imaginava, revelações interessantes e até mesmo surpreendentes, como quando elas afirmam que toda vez que vão entrar no palco ainda tremem, ou mesmo gravar uma cena como se estivessem prendendo a respiração até que tudo termine, pois sempre imaginei que com o tempo, soasse tão natural e espontâneo, quase entediante, como normalmente qualquer outra profissão...",1

7804,"Just grand- these ladies are brilliant in mind and spirit. About 80 min. worth of reminiscence of long, remarkable careers, husbands, and their craft. Fascinating, heartwarming, and damned funny, I recommend this for fans of the theater an esp. British cinema. 3.6 stars",1
7805,Horribly made and even worse editing. Made the great ladies of movies look like doddering old fools. They should have sued. They should have brought in someone who knew what they were doing to interview them.,0

7808,What a delightful Sunday watch it was for me. I recommend it wholeheartedly.,1
7809,"Watching these four grand Dames of England sit down and talk about their self-doubts, nerves before performances, aging, marriages, reviewers, and their interactions with fellow actors and directors was wonderful. Adding to this, some amazing archival footage of some of their performances on stage and screen was certainly a bonus.

However, to be honest, the film got off to a disjointed start and there were some awkward moments as well. But things went much smoother as it progressed and there was also some laugh out loud humor. Like Judi Dench's hilarious description of how she called the paramedics when she was bitten by a bee in the backside and the very young EMT tech asked if she had a carer (in the USA a home aide) how she became furious and told him to ""f-off"".

Overall, director Roger Michell's questions to the four actresses from the wings as the film rolled did not work well, But just to see and hear these grand Dames together was worth the price of admission to me.",1

7815,minimal set - leaves it all to the imagination,1
7816,"I found this quite a compelling watch, I suppose primarily because we're following the situation entirely from the viewpoint of the call handler. We can only imagine whats physically happened or happening and so there's a lot of suspense. I felt I could relate to the police officer taking the call, wanting desperately to help the lady in trouble and her kids but being hampered with limited information to pass on.

I would definitely recommend this film.",1

7818,That film is just breathtaking...from the beginning to the ene!!!,1
7819,"Eventhough some may be able to guess a few twists and turns, this movie is minimalism at its best. It's tense and well acted if not exactly really rewatchable because the movie strongly relies on not knowing whats ahead which is a slight problem if you are in fact able to guess its twist. Therefore it's not 5 Stars but its a really strong 4 1/2 Stars still.",1

7825,"A well made documentary following the rise and eventual tragic end of fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Made up of archive material and interviews with his friends, co-workers and family the film is at its visual best when we see footage of some of the extraordinary shows that made McQueen's name. He is shown for what he was, a huge talent, driven and passionate about what he did almost to the exclusion of everything else. It was this obsession and perhaps the unforgiving world in which he lived that ultimately lead to his suicide as this was a young man who was clearly in trouble and devoured by an insatiable world constantly hungry for the next big thing.

7828,"Sad story. A young talented man dead too soon due to schizophrenia set on by drug use. Tragic. It's also the story of a selfish woman who killed herself and thus devastated him. Nicely done doc, but nothing great. WAY too many close ups of the Spanish guy. Very informative if you aren't aware of the the crazy European modern fashion world. One feels they didn't delve deeply enough (or at all) into what made him tick. What a shame. This lovely young man taken so soon. Lost potential. And what nice white teeth he had.",0

7830,"Excellent movie. Amazing cast, great directing and cinematography -wonderful story",1
7831,"I found this quite a charming film from early on, with the characters being quite low key, not especially noticeable people, which allows them to do what they do you could say - they have their quirks and their clearly quite close as a family, while there is also sibling rivalry and the like. It felt quite authentic, although I suppose I wouldn't necessarily know how such people live their lives. I found it endearing how the younger members helped each other out. 

There is some funny dialogue - in an amusing way, rather than especially laugh out loud. I found myself feeling quite sorry for some people, due to their circumstances. It is surprisingly thoughtful, I suppose. Overall I thought this was a very warm and charming film, which I'd recommend, especially to fans of Japanese films. I really liked the under stated nature it has. Ultimately, its a film about family love. I'd also say its quite a symbolic film.

I should note that there are sexual scenes present, so its not suitable for everyone - its rated 15 in the UK, for reference.",1

7833,Few movies are as masterfully crafted and leave as much of an impact as this one.,1
7834,"A year before ""Parasite"" infiltrated class conflict, ""Shoplifters"" expresses the lengths of poverty whilst empathetically connecting in definite terms of what forms family, driven by [hefty] immoral circumstances that reinforces the well-written story with performative honest portrayals under gracefully reminiscent filmmaking, albeit minimal engagement aesthetically receiving a fair rating by merit. (B)",1
7835,"What if Fagin and the Artful Dodger set up a lighthearted criminal gang in early 21st century Japan and also there was a lot of gut-punching family drama?

There's quite a lot to unpack in Shoplifters; it's a drama about imperfect and often self-serving characters who find themselves pulled back and forth between self-interest and a love for others, about living lives that are valid and real despite hardship and complicated circumstances, and about the strength of interpersonal connections that go beyond simple blood relations.  Hirokazu Kore-eda does an excellent job of making the audience feel at home in the cramped family quarters, sharing in the camaraderie and misfortune in equal measure, stripping away concerns about morality in favor of practicality, and leaving his ensemble cast to discover where the emotional chips will fall in such circumstances. Realistic, poignant, and featuring both solid performances and a very good soundtrack, Shoplifters feels a bit like Oliver Twist meets Ozu.

Among recent Palme d'Or winners, this drama with its wealth of emotional complexity certainly feels among the more deserving. (4/5)",1

How does a priest turned TV host  (remember this was the 1950's) know Kabbalah as indicated by his professed adherence to ""Tikkun Olam?"" A text Christian sects regard as satanic/blasphemous. That would've been an interesting line of inquiry. My guess = freemason.",1
7850,"There is definitely something a little eighth grade'ish about the dialogue at times, but nothing can rob this classic Ugly Duckling story of its contemporary power. Brilliantly using the device of the 'advice blog' to knit together the struggles of its simply brilliant lead actress, it takes us all, young and old, into the world, familiar to many, unfamiliar to too many, of the use of social media to win and gauge popularity. It treats some real issues a little too lightly, and probably shouldn't have 'gone there' at all with one or two, but is an honest reflection of how the ancient negotiation of becoming an adult is being handled by generations who use their phone as a mirror, constantly interrogating themselves about whether they will ever be beautiful enough to fit in. That the cast throw themselves into this exercise with candour and sensitivity makes this a joy to watch, tinged with the evergreen sadness of witnessing someone on that lonely journey we all take to become who we eventually are.",1

Boys, sex, friendship, social anxiety, shyness--Kayla struggles to find her place, to fit in, to come to terms with who she really is without giving in to withering social pressures. Her father's struggles to connect with her were so true to life!  I loved the film:  Elsie Fisher is superb as Kayla Day, and Bo Burnham directs with honesty and sensitivity.",1
7852,The best acting performance from Elsie Fisher!,1
7853,"Saw this in theatres and when it finished, I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. Its soundtrack hits hard. It is raw, awkward, real, funny, and original. However the biggest piece is the emotion you feel for Kayla as she progresses into the story. It is felt deep inside, through each topsy turvy uncomfortable and tough bump on this ride. A truly spectacular, generational movie.",1
7854,"In a sense, Bo Burnham has given the audience a mirror image of their early adolescent selves. However, not everything, such as technology, hasn't changed since the preceding generation. All generations of viewers may still relate to the fear, cringe, and want to fit in. Ellie did a fantastic job in the 8th grade role she was cast in by Bo. This article, which is not a movie, takes a chilly look at the risks and social awkwardness of growing up in the technological era, where increased sexuality and stimulation are prevalent in youth culture. Everyone should watch this movie, especially 8th graders who are transitioning to 9th grade, in my opinion.",1
7855,"I really liked this film - its simplistic but in a good way. I felt I could relate to the main character and I liked how it seemed to be a case of her putting out an online identity, being this teenager who seems to be laidback and knowledgeable, when really she's clearly somewhat anxious and unsure and concerned about the basic issues (physical appearance, popularity, other peer pressures of young teenage-dom) most have to deal with at that age. This is very much a film focussing on modern technology and, more specifically, the social media age, with the main character being a vlogger. It felt very authentic to me, although I admit its been a while since I was in my awkward teens (being currently in my awkward thirty's instead(!)). I'd say its partly about self image and also self belief. There are quite a few scenes which include awkward silences, which is something I could relate to - I suppose for people of different personalities (people who aren't introverted or socially anxious etc.), it may seem a bit slow or boring but as I say, I related to it and it seemed pretty genuine, so I appreciated that.

I guess it might sound a bit cheesy but I didn't think it seemed unnecessarily cliched or cheesy in a negative sense, with perhaps the exception of one scene towards the end but it hardly ruined the film for me. Overall its a well made coming of age film, which I'd happily recommend. Oh yeah and...Gucci! (if you've seen the film then you'll understand).",1

7860,"This is a gritty film. Its not an action film but it does reasonably well at portraying siblings trying to get some form of justice for what has happened to them. It features some good camerawork and isn't overly full of dialogue but I think that helps it to seem a bit more substantial than, perhaps, other similar films. Its not quite what I expected and it isn't a film likely to stay in my mind for very long but that aside, its not a bad film...an ok one. I wouldn't especially recommend going out of your way to see it but if its on TV and interests you then it may be worth a watch.",0

Now, just for the record, if anyone is looking for something close to perfection in the genre of ""stand up comedy"" I would recommend Patrice O'Neil's 'Elephant In The Room' (RIP Patrice) 
""Nanette"" on the other hand- Is NOT funny! ..It's not even in the realm of funny. It is the most smug, preachy, condescending, patronizing, circle jerk for affluent 'HR Department' types. ..People who are so uptight- They walk with their legs crossed!
Anyways. 
It's just as sad that the  'audience score' is at 26% ..I mean, how on Earth is it that high!?!? ..I thought 'Covid' made me lose faith in humanity! ..My Lord!

It's remarkably clear-eyed for a film made by someone about himself and his group of friends, and it manages to keep weaving the narrative of the boys' lives around their love of skateboarding without ever becoming a film just about the sport itself. Revealing and powerful without ever being miserable, it deserves to be seen by the widest of audiences.",1

7920,"Carla Simón's debut film is wise, not only in cinematographic terms but in her understanding of the human being, specially - and more complicated- of childhood. Accompanied by her surprising child interpreters, the director immerses us in the story of Frida, a girl who lost her parents to AIDS and who is full of questions, sadness and, of course, anger. What makes this film transcendent despite its simplicity is the subtlety with which the director tells the story, without the need for clichés and unnecessary resources, wasted by use, such as sad music or incessant tearing, shows that based on of small details and very strong feelings it is possible to innovate in the coming-of-age. What I like the most is that the director is smart enough to know that children are not innocent and can plan, manipulate and take revenge, although she does not judge her little protagonist for it.",1
7921,"I felt I was not watching a movie. I was watching a summer in some people's real life. It reminded me of what it was to be a child and be confused, sad and angry, and to lose a loved one to death at that age.

7922,"'Estiu 1993' is an exquisite film: not just because of its superb acting, its lovely ambience, or its brilliant shots; its beauty lies at the way it explores the feelings of a child - that of jealousy, shame, sadness, confusion, enthusiasm and more. It does not treat the child as an immature human, as unimportant, as a simple-to-understand doll. No, 'Estiu 1993' explores - perhaps not fully, but this might be impossible - the children's feelings in a rarely-seen respectful and earnest way.",1

7936,"My initial reaction to the start of this film is that it very much reminded me of Captain Fantastic, which came out a few years ago. I find the plot interesting - the concept of people genuinely living out 'in the wild' so to speak. I thought it was quite an atmospheric watch and while the plot pace is quite slow and there's not a great amount of dialogue, I found it quite thought provoking, mainly in terms of it making me question how society rely on people living by their rules, or being judged harshly if not.

I could imagine what the father and daughter were thinking, at times in which their not speaking but clearly expressing themselves by way of body language. They are clearly very thoughtful people. I tried to imagine myself in their shoes, to think how I might regard modern society as someone previously living in the outskirts of it. Its a thinking persons film, I reckon. Not everyone will enjoy it, it might bore some, given there's no action scenes, no car chases etc. but as a character driven drama with some interesting themes (identity, privacy etc.), it was an intriguing and thoughtful watch. 

I also particularly liked the use of music in the background to add to the atmosphere in certain scenes - I imagine this would be worth seeing in a cinema if possible, for it does have a sort of mildly claustrophobic feel to it at times. Its one of those films which may well have you changing your mind about your opinions on the characters at different times in the plot but suffice to say things aren't entirely clear cut. There is also  certain poignancy present. In any case, I didn't find it a boring film - I found it somewhat moving, if anything.",1
7937,"Another lost flixster rating.  This presented an interesting premise, but it didn't take a position on the issues.  Instead, it seemed to just ""observe"".  I liked the conflict between characters and the mental issues they faced.  However, it was tedious and I was frustrated with their motivations and ties.  Having lived in Portland, I appreciated their consideration of that culture.  I don't plan to see it again.  It was on Netflix.",0
