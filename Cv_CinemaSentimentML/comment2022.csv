0,"Impressive to say the least, I enjoyed this work of art.",1
1,"A powerful, moving, and simple film that plainly shows the effects of an unplanned pregnancy on a young woman living in France before safe and legal abortions were available. Her mood, her schoolwork, her friendships, and her relationships with her family are all strained as she struggles to cope with the situation and seeks out a way to end her pregnancy. The filmmaking is not flashy but it is good.",1
2,it is an easy example of roller coaster destiny of human being.,1
3,"A very hard watch. Slow, slow, slow. Ending saved it, but really I wouldn't recommend. A whole lot of nothing.",0
4,Absolute must-see in this period of time where women's rights are under attack all over the world.,1
5,"An educational film. The camera lens follows every second of the main character, a college student who experiences moments of great tension when she finds out that she is pregnant, which can change her life forever. By not accepting that situation, she follows a route full of risks and sorrows, the dilemma between life and death, between the ethical and the immoral; in a female environment where she feels cornered. Despite her personal stubbornness, it is clear the great responsibility that each woman has to face towards her sexuality and the emotional and social consequences of it. All this boils in the protagonist's mind, and she lets us know in each scene, in each movement of this girl followed by the camera and everyone's eyes.",1
6,"Probably the most ""need to be seen movie"" out there. It shows the ugly truth about where our country is headed if we don't do  something! The desperation and loneliness of the character Anne is visceral and hard to watch, but it must be seen.",1
7,Fantastic movie. Please guys support my new films discussion site. Scenedebate. Your support is highly appreciated. Thank y'all.,1
8,Haha at first I thought of the Mark Wahlberg Happening. Finally a film that recovers this title. Good acting!,1
9,"Poignant, powerful film demonstrating the impossible conflict for girls and women pitted against the oppressive laws written by men in the country women live and have created their lives. Eternally of lowest societal status, the young woman in this film, determined to claim her autonomy, shows us the heart wrenching abandonment and judgment not only of her Sisters, but of those callous and calculating men who have worked diligently to put women back in their place, because it is advantageous to them. Brilliant writing, acting and directing leaves no emotion unexplored, taking the audience prisoner from the beginning.",1
10,"Excelente película, muy actual a pesar de ser de ambientada en los 70s.",1
11,"How can a small sea shell with a glued on eye and plastic shoes captivate and enchant for nearly 90 minutes?    I can't explain...but it does, and was my favorite movie of 2022.    

Not every scene works but when it does, it's so heartwarming that you can forgive its foibles.    Beautiful story and sentiment at a time when we really need an antidote to over-produced, over-blown and disposable content.",1
12,I was quickly charmed by this movie. Appreciate the relationship between Marcel and Dean and definitely enjoyed listening to the little shell’s worldview.,1
13,One of the sweetest movies I've seen in a long time.,1
14,"Funny, sweet, heartwarming. Pretty much the antithesis of your average blockbuster.",1
15,"Fofíssimo, sensível e surpreendente. Sim, é um filme um pouco lento e calminho - vide trilha sonora. Mas isso não é nem de longe um demérito, até porque deve ter sido bem intencional da parte do diretor. Que personagem mais fofo e apaixonante é Marcel (Jenny Slate). O carisma dele já é notado desde os primeiros minutos de cena. Aliás o design dos personagens é criativo e corriqueiro ao mesmo tempo, o que gera uma conexão e empatia quase que automática com eles. Gosto, também, dessa mescla entre a animação e o mundo real. E que ideia ótima apresentar uma história para esses personagens num documentário fictício. Uma das coisas que mais gostei no longa é como ele apresenta os conflitos e problemas dos personagens, principalmente de Marcel e de sua Nanna Connie (Isabella Rossellini): o medo e a sensação de sufoco diante da exposição na mídia, as consequências de um conteúdo viralizado, a perda de privacidade, a morte de entes queridos, o luto, os maus do Alzheimer e doenças correlatas e até a necessidade de Marcel de um momento a sós consigo, fruto dos anos vivendo somente com a avó. Eu amei!",1
16,I watched this movie after being introduced to a24 from Everything Everywhere All at Once and I have to say this is one of my top 3 movies it just feels so real the atmosphere and the characters just create this relationship with the audience through Dean and it just works even though how absurd it is that there is a shell called marcel AND HE HAS SHOES ON it feels like it happened and I love it,1
17,"If you aren't feeling particularly soft headed this movie may try your patience.  It is cute and quirky and at first clever, but goes on along the same line for far too long in the same tone, then attempts a little tear-jerking, only to resume the same steady, twee goofiness.  It's an accomplishment in terms of uniqueness, but for me the end was overdue and welcome.",0
18,"Marcel is a simple but efficient movie. The story is funny, yet with complex emotions of loss. It is funny, not in a big joke sens, more like smiling at. You smile at the simplicity and the strangeness. By the side, it takes a look at social media and it's peoples, but always into the perspective of Marcel. The animations are pretty good and done with a certain level of mastery. I give it 88%. Marcel is a movie I won't forget because, it was unique and told with the flair of a movie like Spirited Away.",1
19,It was an amazing movie overall. I highly recommend watching this movie.,1
20,"Refreshing way to approach a movie, and a very endearing character.",1
21,"Great film in so many ways. New perspectives, brilliant characters and wonderful acting. But most of all, amazing script and above all lots of laughters in a witty dialogue. A must see!!",1
22,"SMOOTHIE FINISH
A rather frank Finish feature of girls deciphering hormonal urges as they mature into adulthood. The matter of fact sex talk is blunt, refreshing, insightful and often funny, as director Alli Haapasalo avoids the sensationalistic and exploitative Hollywood pratfalls of bedroom romps. These are kids, experimenting, exploring, learning, fumbling, growing and most importantly, discussing. A talkie, not a humpy.

Mimmi and Ronkko swap sex tales whilst serving up ridiculously named smoothies (""It Takes Two To Mango"") at the local food court, when clique preppie figure skater Emma disrupts their world. The punky, cynical and rebellious Mimmi (Aamu Milonoff) argues with, then falls for the forbidden fruit, and we have story. A story that feels natural, flows true, views like a diary.

Milonoff is sensational in the lead, owning the screen at every emotional turn: burning embarrassment at her mother's neglect, seducing her target on the dance floor, and lashing out physical for attention. Though this is a three girl story across three Friday nights, and Haapasalo splits the plot pie in equal portions, Milonoff as Mimmi steals the show. ""Girl Picture"" is her movie.

Watch out!

23,"Rarely have I seen a film with so much emotional nuance, as well as taking an incredibly familiar story-type (coming of age/romance) and having some nice little surprises. Truly beautiful.",1
24,"Terrific movie with lovely, arresting performances and great editing and timing.",1
25,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!!!",1
26,I had the honor to screen this at Sundance and interview the Director and cast. It is a charming movie that handles the lives of these young women with real life moments and unapologetic honesty. I am so glad that more people have the chance to see this film.,1
27,A brilliant coming of age story about young women navigating modern Finland. Very reminiscent of Frances Ha and Greta Gerwig dramedy.,1
28,"Extraordinary storytelling. Entertaining but  profound. Awesome performances by the three young leads Milonoff, Leino and Kauhanen.",1
29,One of the best movies I've seen this year. Great writing and acting. The music was also good.,1
30,Story is dark but has so many fascinating layers. Colin Farrell is absolutely remarkable. Cinematography is beautiful.,1
31,"A strange and depressing movie.  Trust your gut… if you watch the trailer and think “seems strange” go with that feeling and save your money.  This is one of those movies the critics rave about, but us “less insightful” people leave the theater thinking “I have no idea what that movie was about”.",0
32,The worst. Who cares. Why bother,0
33,A terrible depressing movie!  What was the movie's plot or purpose?  Colin Farrell's talent was wasted in this movie. Would not recommend this movie.,0
34,Very dark at times but great story.,1
35,Absolutely amazing acting and story,1
36,Good modern Irish fable that is allegory for the troubles in the Irish history. Great performances from leads and Kerry Condon was marvelous!,1
37,"A beautiful, ultimately tragic film with consequences that did not seem necessary.  Excellent acting and a beautiful setting make this well worth watching.",1
38,"Dont be afraid to laugh out loud even though the movie has a laid back feel to the characters and their behavior, which slowly intensifies through the film.",1
39,"Loved the actors, storyline, creativity of the script, and the setting in that order.  This director has created some of my favorite movies.  I love that Colin and Brendan were appearing together again after seeing them In Bruges.  I think Colin Farrell is so funny and his facial expressions (and those eyebrows) are genius.  I had some good laughs and amusement watching this movie.  Some people may not like it, but if you are ready for quirky youll love it.",1
40,"Was a good movie but shouldve been more powerful. Only thing I think wouldve made it more powerful wouldve been to show the brutality. I get why the director chose not to show the violence but I would say for this story it was a weird choice seeing as how Mrs. Till in real life chose to show the brutalitys aftereffect to make people see and not hide it. 

Other than that, was a good film. The scenery and production is gorgeous and brings out the 50s fashion and life. Love the use of the yellow color and how its given a life of its own.",1
41,Very well done.just sorry that the theater was not full,1
42,It was a true story that needed to be told. America needs to know the evil and pain of prejudice.,1
43,"Danielle Deadwyler was technically brilliant, and carried the film.",1
44,"While it gave enough details of what happened to Emmett Till, it was a wonderful portrail of a mother's love.  All of the acting was wonderful.  I forgot they were actors.",1
45,Very good movie.  I loved that it showed a different perspective.  It was not about the murder of Till but the fight of a mother for her child.,1
46,great education movie and it's still happening,1
47,Excellent movie! Should receive several awards!,1
48,A valuable story to see and to know.  Well acted and played.  Worth seeing.,1
49,"It was riveting. I was accompanied by a person who was a born in the mid seventies and apparently had not heard about it or Medgar Evers in the history books in school. So it was also very educational and definitely a story that needed to be told. The entire cast was outstanding and kudos to Danielle Deadwyler, and Whoopi for producing it.",1
50,"A beautiful and poignant movie, well worth your time.",1
51,"""You don't have to say anything...many's the person who missed the opportunity to say nothing, and lost much because of it"".  Beautiful, poetically quiet film that said so little but conveyed so much.",1
52,Iontach! Thar barr! Bhí cuid mhór daoine sa pictiurlann ag caoineadh faoi dheireadh an scannan seo. Cumhactach!,1
53,You need to go into this realizing that you have to  observe the chaactes to follow the story instead of dialogue spelling it out for you-very memorable images,1
54,"One of the better Irish films I have watched in recent years. However, the director squanders a lot of good work with a needlessly schmaltzy ending.",0
55,"My movie of the year and a masterpiece of delicious restraint, wonderful acting and superb cinematography and score.   It conveys with great empathy the basic and profound truth that care and attention are required for any life , especially a childs life, in order to grow and flourish.  It filled my heart and has stayed with me long after the event while other movies I believed were great have since faded from my thoughts.",1
56,"Fantastic film based somewhat on Claire Keegan's novel foster 

Wonderful advertisement for Irish cinema with fantastic performances from Foster Mam and Dad and the eponymous young star.

Another example of Irish Gaelic film production (not Scots Gaelic as mentioned above) which has been booming in the last few years and a worthy entry to the international film category at the Oscars",1
57,One of the most beautiful films I have seen in a longer while. Very sensual and beautifully executed.,1
58,"If this movie does not move you, you have no heart.",1
59,"The Quiet Girl is a quietly magnificent film that although quiet in nature packs a very large emotional punch. Set mostly in the Irish language the feature film debut of director Colm Bairead is truly a wonder to behold. Set in Ireland in 1981 the film centres on 9YO Cait who lives in a household of neglect. Her father constantly drinks and gambles and her mother is about to have another child. Cait is barely noticed in the house and doesn't receive any true love or attention. The parents then decide to send her away for a period of time to a middle aged couple, one of whom is a distant cousin. Right here is the essence of the film as Cait for the first time discovers love, attention and the heart of home. The couple are loving, especially Eibhlin. Sean is rather withdrawn and taciturn but eventually he also forms a bond with Cait. This extremely gentle film conveys pure emotion in a quite simply beautiful way. Scenes of rural life are handled with great care as we see the withdrawn Cait open up to the possibilities of life. The cast are truly great especially Catherine Clinch as Cait in her first film role. I loved this film, it is truly full of life and heart and hope.",1
60,Great prequel to the story. Glad it got animated!,1
61,Good backstory im disappointed the main character wasn't in the movie.,1
62,it was a good story but i feel like it could have been a OVA. was it me or was the animation trying to hard to be pretty that it did itself a disjustice?,1
63,"this one did catch me off guard at first because I was expecting it to be based off the anime but it was before the anime. but it was really good still, animations on point",1
64,a fantastic wild ride of a storyline,1
65,Ive rewatched this movie three times in a span of two months if thats not enough to convince you that this movie is top tier I dont know what will. This is officially my favorite movie of all time. Yuta and his backstory made me cry multiple times (I never cry) they did a phenomenal job and anyone who hasnt watched it is missing out on peak fiction. I want to rewatch this movie again for a 4th time Im definitely buying the Blu-ray. Also forgot to mention that 3 different friends tagged along each time who have never watched anime or never seen JJK before and they went CRAZY over it. Words cannot describe how much I truly loved how they executed this.,1
66,NANAMI IS SO HECKING FINE GOOD LORD,1
67,Amazing artwork & a good prequel to the series,1
68,"Good storyline, awesome graphics and fights! What's not to love!",1
69,Perfect Movie literally the best of the best would watch again if more showings,1
70,I loved this movie I came across it on Amazon new releases. Andrea Riseborough is amazing she should win a Oscar for her performance!! everybody was very good in this Indie film its too bad these movies get passed up alot of times for awards. Ive seen it twice and could watch it again! I highly recommend this film!,1
71,"Andrea Riseborough's performance is nothing short of astounding and her character's transformation a joy to behold. To see qualities such as kindness and forgiveness and maturity and a sense of community in a film is wonderfully refreshing. There are some hilarious scenes, some moving scenes, and a tight, witty dialogue that moves the whole film along at a great pace. It is also beautiful to look at, a dreamy quality created by being made on film and not digital, which has made certain shots linger in my mind. This film is a triumph and is surely Oscar materlal.",1
72,"Good writing and acting all around. Janey as usual is great. Maron was good too. But the actress that plays the lead, Andrea Riseborough, is absolutely amazing. She knows this world. Or she has observed it and really paid attention. Her portrayal was heartbreaking and illuminating. Just a revelation and the movie was worth my time to watch her, even if it wasn't as good as it is already.",1
73,I'm not a fan of movies about dysfunctional families or losers such as addicts so this movie wasn't for me. I was bored or frustrated the whole time and the ending was almost a relief.,0
74,This one took me by surprise. Andrea Riseborough is a force of nature! Huge recommend. 5/5. And Andrea deserves an Oscar!,1
75,Not my thing. A depressing movie that I almost turned off several times.,0
76,Andrea Riseborough offers the best performance I've seen in the last few years. A must see!!!,1
77,Andrea Riseborough is phenomenal here!,1
78,"Andrea Riseborough is phenomenal in this gritty, heartbreaking and finally life affirming movie about regret and redemption.",1
79,Solid flick. Steady story. Great performances.,1
80,Exceptional filmmaking. Revelatory.  Great cultural insight conveyed through clean visionary drama.  Highly recommended. Compelling performances.,1
81,Masterful! This movie slowly won me over until it became a favorite.  It  respects the audience enough to allow us to make our own conclusions.  So different than Hollywood.  So refreshing!,1
82,Touching... I'm speechless.,1
83,"I just wept my heart out. This is the kind of movie that might teach us all a bit more humility and humanity. The beautiful landscape and the sweetness of those Bhutanese people are absolutely heartwarming. I really don't like movies during which I have to read subtitles throughout it, but in this case it would be a real shame to watch a dubbed version. Within our actual world of rightist populists, trying to divide people, spreading hatred and rage into every direction, this flick is a touching example how it can be done just the opposite, the loving and caring, way. 8 1/2 of 10 points",1
84,"Fotografia maravilhosa, das paisagens do Butão, um filme butanês adorável… Uma aula de respeito a cultura e necessidade de cuidarmos da natureza… Tudo lindo… Esse filme vai muito além, uma produção incrível de Pawo Choyning Dorji que dirigiu e escreveu um roteiro perfeito, inserido nesses moradores locais, com suas histórias reais, não se trata de uma biografia, mas foram usadas a escola e situações do professor atuante, Lunana recebeu energia elétrica pouco depois das filmagens, merecia Oscar.",1
85,This was a cute movie with a feel good story. The acting was good and the cinematography was excellent. It's a nice family movie.,1
86,"This is a very simple movie, without any fast action or exciting plot. A teacher has to go to a village in the Himalayas in the middle of nowhere, doesn't want to teach, wants action and to go off and see the world and become a singer. Instead he's stuck in a place without a decent bathroom. And you see how the attitude of the people to him, in particular the children, change him and cause him to connect to a deeper sense of himself and of the world.  It's sort of inspiring. Its very simplicity leads you to quiet down in yourself as well.",1
87,Simply the best Movie. So inspiritional...,1
88,"Good story, great scenery, nice music, adorable children (and I'm not a fan of children).",1
89,"Here's a rare movie where I am in complete agreement with the critics more than the audience.  I think this is a perfect sentimental masterpiece.  The reluctant teacher goes to a remote place that he doesn't want to go to, only to find himself enchanted by his life changing experience there.  This is a beautiful movie that gets the human emotions right.  The superficial teacher winds up having his heart opened up to a new experience.  He learned more from his new surroundings and friends than he imagined he would.  He was appreciated in his new surroundings in ways he couldn't have foreseen.  This is a movie that will make you think about our abundantly superficial modern society up against a more pure and ancient way of living.  I loved this.  It struck an emotional chord with me.  Amazing.",1
90,Excellent animation and visuals but the story lacked the mysticism of the original. Del Toro sacrificed innocence and organic emotional wonder for a grounded reality. Adults will enjoy this more than kids.,1
91,Such a good movie and story line ...with bit emotional ride come with it,1
92,Amazing cinematic work by Del Toro! This is my favorite version of Pinocchio by far!,1
93,"Very well written, visual captivating and artistically sound.

Was a very touching story about enjoying what you have and the value of love between two people. Perfect movie for the holidays to remind you what is important in life .",1
94,"Loved it, a most see",1
95,Beautiful animation and story.,1
96,"A really great movie and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.I still like the classic Pinocchio more, but this is a unique version that can stand on it's own. It's basically a more gruesome and adult version of the tale, with more focus on Gepetto's pain and loneliness. If you're a parent that has ever lost a child, this will hit home. Either seeing the movie in theaters or streaming it at home, this version is worth watching if you don't mind a some gruesomeness.

For more movie thoughts follow me @MedleyMovies",1
97,"Del Toro is already known for creative content, storytelling, and master direction. However, having these exceptional award winning attributes does not guarantee that one can pull succeed in this genre.

All I can say is move over of Tim Burton, make room for  the new master of stop animation.  Supported by captivating character development, impressive set dressing, sound/lighting and technical wizardry, The movie is nearly perfect.

I personally enjoyed the screenplay, but as you can read in some of the reviews, although the movie wasn’t specifically made for children in a classic retelling, it did have some serious material that might be too much for young children to process. This doesn’t take away from the movie earning class status to an adult audience, but it is not the a movie that your child is going to want to see over and over other classic fairytale movies.

95 out of 100",1
98,"It's a fun, sweet movie, the music is beautiful, recommended for everyone, really heartwarming",1
99,"I was not aware of this movie. I thought I was buying tickets to another Pinocchio movie with Tom Hanks. We were disappointed to see stop motion animation, which I was never a fan of, but we did see about half of the movie before leaving. It's just disappointing that it wasn't the movie I thought it was. Now we have to save up and see the Tom Hanks Pinocchio.",0
100,These actors are superb. The story unbelievable. What a delightful movie.,1
101,"An engaging finish uplifts a sometimes too slow 'The Duke' into a satisfying watch for hubby and wife date night.  In the end of the day the tone doesn't equal what the film is: a romantic comedy.  Jim Broadbent and Hellen Mirren have an expected chemistry in Roger Michell's second to last film.  Based on a true story, but how much is true is up to the imagination!  Wife: 7.1/Hubby 6.9 Average: 7/10",1
102,"I wish Netflix will learn how to make good, decent, clean movies and drama series without undue sex scenes that don't even belong in the script. This one is an excellent example of what movies should be",1
103,An interesting story told well.  A quality production.,1
104,"Outstanding in every way. Falls into the category of ""don't miss this movie""",1
105,Very interesting based-on-truth story. A comedy-drama that is both well acted and well constructed. A charming little one indeed.,1
106,"This charming film lands well and uplifts. I'm sure it's well-received by all but the grumpiest, coldest movie-watchers. Sure it almost verges into twee sentimentality but it delicately avoids that fate and presents itself as a well-balanced, heart-warming experience.",1
107,"Best movie of the year so far, and likely will remain so. Both, Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren,  give absolutely wonderful performances, and top the list of Oscar contenders this year, in the true story of the theft of the Duke of Wellington, a portrait of the man who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. It was painted by Francisco de Goya, and would be worth tens of millions today. Check out his other famous paintings, the 2nd and 3rd of May, 1808. Anyway, I loved the film and it's performances so  I give it a perfect score,  5 stars out of 5.",1
108,"The true story upon which it's based is quite marvellous, but there just isn't enough content to stretch it out into a feature-length film and it shows. ‘The Duke' spends almost 2/3's of its time not going anywhere fast and only really gets going during the well-crafted, somewhat sappy final act. There was a side-plot that was clearly used to bulk out the content, but it was a subject that would have required proper attention to be effective and it definitely didn't get that. The perfectly cast and superb Jim Broadbent is very likeable as the do-gooder, everyday man and he's the only thing the first 2 acts, which serve mostly as a character study, have going for them. Overall, it's amusing, but as charming as it is in parts, it's not as good as I'd hoped.",0
109,"Great true story with an amazing cast who did an awesome portrayal of the characters!
Great film!",1
110,"""Hellbender"" presents us with a crafted combination of occult and family drama.
A girl lives with her mother in a secluded house in the forest, with no contact with the outside world. Their relationship gets a dark tone when the girl starts questioning her isolation and uncovers her family's ties with witchcraft. 
I am definitely becoming a fan of the Adams Family Films (""The Deeper You Dig"" is also amazing).",1
111,Amazing movie.  Best of 2022.,1
112,"1 star, this is very bad",0
113,i found it pretty weird.......but watched it anyway,0
114,"Was definitely not your cookie cutter plot line, and they were able to accomplish so much with a small budget. It kept my attention and I found the story refreshing and the music was also nice !",1
115,"The majority of people just expect to watch the same over and over, when they finally have the chance to see something different, it's like they don't appreciate it, or even more, they may just not understand it. 
Cheers for actors, directors and producers who dares to do different things.
Awesome movie!!!
I really loved it!!!",1
116,Heredity goes Punk! I can dig it!,1
117,it's a shame to see it with such a high rating poor casting poor idea dark enviroment boring scenario extremly horrible,0
118,Interesting movie but except for the central song there's nothing memorable about it. Good performances.,0
119,This was one of the worst horrors I have seen.,0
120,"Absolutely fantastic, best show on tv at the moment",1
121,Beavis and Butthead is what the universe needed the most.,1
122,"Esta película no estuvo mala. Me gusto mucho como han aumentado su vocabulario en esta película. Descargue la película gratis, así que me alegro de no haberla pagado.",1
123,Hilarious! This movie nails almost everything on what makes beavis and butt-head so iconic in the first place.,1
124,"Great comedies are rare and difficult to find. This new Beavis and Butthead feature is one of them. I discovered these two teenaged idiots doing their hilarious thing in between allegedly serious music videos around 1995. Then their/ Mike Judges full length debut ""Beavis and Butthead Do America""completely won me over, it is anabsolutely hysterical classic. Mr. Judge then gave us Office Space and eventually the brilliant Silicon Valley, where I've worked,  which clearly makes him a certified satirical comedy genius. 

The beauty of his latest effort is that it is just as simple, juvenile and, yes, gross as you remember it from the 90's. The artwork remains intentionally primitive , the plot indescribably nonsensical. It has the same lack of character development and stock clueless authority figures as Do America did. It even satirizes, via intentionally positioned background noise coverup, a potentially serious reference to Beavis's culturally deprived single parent background. Apparently he's a second generation complete idiot. Nothing is sacred when these two morons are doing the universe. Hysterical. 

Extra points because my dear wife, a woman of taste,  can't believe I enjoy these clueless idiots and their antics.",1
125,"As a big Beavis and Butthead fan, I really enjoyed this film. Im glad that the humor hasn't changed, Mike Judge isn't afraid of making fun of gender studies and white privilege. Those jokes definitely had me laughing out loud. If u dont get offended easily, then definitely check this one out",1
126,great to see our friends again.. it's been too long!! :),1
127,"This movie...is the definition of humor! I've loved the Beavis and Butthead TV Show as their jokes are always original, and they always make you laugh. This movie can never fail to make you laugh and if you are feeling sad, just, watch this movie!!",1
128,"Humorous, Droll, quite droll",1
129,"One of the best films of the year! It really is constantly funny and insanley good, well executed satire",1
130,"It's touching and sensitive, it treats morality beyond homosexuality and shows freedom as the paradox it is. Franz Rogowski is just exquisite.",1
131,"As a greatly anticipated film for me  it turned out to be different to what I expected. I admit also that much of that anticipation was to see Franz Rogowski again after watching every moment of him in IN THE AISLES. Yes the cruelty of the injustice that put the main protagonist in jail is an important theme, but that it turns the mirror on us, as we are now, in the final minutes of the film is the beauty of this film.",1
132,"A beautiful, sensitive film about endurance.  Textured, detailed, gritty, and moving.",1
133,Devastating and heartwarming at the same time.,1
134,"Swapping post-WWI Britain for post-WWII Germany, Sebastian Miese's film is the second one this Film Festival depicting life as a gay man back in the dark days of discrimination and criminalisation. Imagine Jean Genet's The Shawshank Redemption, filtered through Rainer Fassbinder's tragic romanticism (or a love affair between Querelle and Shawshank), if you will. Franz Rogowski's Hans has been bouncing in and out of prison as a result of Paragraph 175 in German law which criminalises 'sex act committed between persons of the male sex'. Intercutting between three different sentences he serves in the 40s, 50s and 60s, the different men in different periods of his life neatly encapsulate the history of homosexuals who are persecuted by an unjust law often with tragic consequences. The only constant throughout is Georg Friedrich's lifer Viktor, with whom he strikes up a relationship that begins originally with disgust before understanding and kindness transform it into something else. Meise's film is a masterclass in storytelling and how to keep an audience entranced until the final frame. Rogowski, who reminds me of a German Joaquin Phoenix, has a subtle intensity and quiet charisma that makes you ache for his sweet-natured Hans to find the peace and love he deserves. Matching him scene for scene is Friedrich's hard on the outside, tender on the inside Viktor and their relationship is beautifully drawn out by their nuanced performances; not to mention the excellent make-up work that ages them up through the decades. Hands down, the strongest narrative and my favourite poster at this year's Film Festival, this is a captivating and elegantly constructed portrait of a friendship under strange and untenable circumstances, with a recidivist epilogue that's pretty much the antithesis of the ending in Shawshank, leaving us on a bittersweet note that Fassbinder would approve.",1
135,Probably the most boring film I ever watched in my entire life.,0
136,It was shortlisted for the International Film Oscar but didn't make the shortlist.  It should've and it should've won.,1
137,"Life was once quite different for the LGBTQ+ community years ago. The mere act of engaging in same-sex relations was a criminal offense in many now-progressive countries, an activity punishable by branding offenders as perverts and landing them in prison for extended periods. One of those countries was West Germany, whose draconian measures even went so far as to transfer homosexuals liberated from concentration camp incarceration to state imprisonment after World War II. The harsh, prejudicial treatment experienced by West German gay men between 1945 and 1969, when the nation's laws against homosexual conduct were finally abandoned, provides the basis for this prison drama/love story told in four segments about the lives of four inmates, three of them gay and one of them more than a little curious. Director Sebastian Meise's second narrative feature presents an unflinching look at what gay men were up against during the time, when the simple act of loving someone of the same sex could have dire consequences, especially for the outspoken who believed one's love life was none of the state's business. Despite some occasional pacing issues (undoubtedly deliberate though at times frustrating in its attempt at conveying the tedium of prison life), this engaging and heartfelt drama makes its case without being preachy or heavy-handed and features fine performances by Franz Rogowski, Georg Friedrich, Thomas Prenn and Anton von Lucke, along with some inventive camera work. It's indeed heartening to see how far we've come in the years since then, but ""Great Freedom"" reminds us of how far we've had to journey in getting there – and how there are those in this world who are still subjected to this kind of needless abuse.",1
138,"Great Freedom is an Austrian prison drama that elevates the genre by being more nuanced, minimalist and ambiguous in its approach. It is a film that consistently follows the show and don't tell formula and that made it a highly cinematic, artistic viewing experience. It's a superbly acted, skillfully directed, emotionally exhilarating period drama about humans' need to emotionally connect with others even in the darkest of places.",1
139,"I liked it, but it wasn't mind blowing.",1
140,"without a doubt one of the best films I have seen in a very long time. in terms of a sequel almost perfect, dare I say better even than the original!",1
141,One of the best sequels in a VERY long time!,1
142,"Incredible experience from start to finish. it does what very few sequels have been able to accomplish, surpass the original. loved this film!",1
143,"Top Gun Maverick is a decent action movie that manages to deliver some exciting aerial sequences and decent performances from its cast. However, it's not a movie that's particularly memorable or groundbreaking, and it's not one that I would feel the need to watch again.

The plot is fairly formulaic, and the characters are somewhat predictable, with some familiar beats of the original Top Gun. While it's fun to see Tom Cruise back in the cockpit, the movie doesn't really add anything new to the franchise. 

Overall, Top Gun Maverick is a passable action movie that might be worth checking out if you're a fan of the original, looking for some mindless entertainment, or study its use of cinematography.",0
144,A good exciting movie that meshed well with the first Top Gun movie  so many years ago—- brought back great memories.  Cinematography was outstanding.!!,1
145,"I was kinda' leery of this 1980's legacy sequel -- particularly as it's still starring Tom Cruise. But I have to say, this was a really good movie. A bit formulaic, yes, but current and more believable (for a movie plot, at least). The acting was great, with some real character development. And the dogfight scenes (which occupy half the movie) were extraordinary. No mention of what happened to Kelly McGillis' character though.",1
146,6th time seeing this movie. Love it!,1
147,"Liked the ""trip down memory lane"" with nostalgia from the original Top Gun movie. Real action shots taken from F-18's and actual carrier operations were very impressive. Jennifer Connelly!",1
148,"Fun movie. I feel I lack the connection to the original Top Gun that may have made me appreciate it more, but still, a solid film. Nary a boring moment.",1
149,"It really pains me to say this but I really did not connect with this movie. Despite that, I'm not going to deny how incredible the filmmaking is. It's beautifully well-shot, the acting is great, and the dialogue feels very natural. The pacing though is just so unbearably slow for my liking. I could not stay focused and the only hour and forty minute run time felt like forever. I can see how so many people adored this movie but it simply was not for me.",0
150,"Paul Mescal is a marvelous actor that needs to be seen in more movies and TV shows!  Frankie Corio gives a nice youth performance.  In addition, I enjoyed the choice of music throughout the film.  However, I wish the writing was clearer and less vague.",0
151,"I really do wonder about the critics sometimes. Reading the reviews, you would think this was the film of the year. Suffice to say, I went in with high expectations...and I have never been so underwhelmed. Just to be clear: as a cinephile, I have no objection to slow pacing, cryptic story-telling or sparse use of dialogue. But there has to be a semblance of a plot, an inciting incident, some identifiable character arc. You have to give the audience something to work with. This movie fails on every one of those fronts. Mind-numbingly boring, self-important drivel. 
It's described as a ""coming of age film"" - I can guarantee you that watching it will feel like an age.",0
152,"I really don't understand this movie. I don't believe I've ever written a review but I feel compelled to for this one.  So drawn out, so slow and I kept hanging on waiting for it to reveal itself.  My husband left about an hour in. I wanted to leave it too but thought I might be rewarded by sticking with it, I'm no so jealous he got to spend his time doing something more enjoyable.",0
153,"Incredibly powerful film. Extraordinary writing, sound editing, characterisation, acting and direction. Heartbreaking but in a refreshingly ambiguous way. I will never hear ""Tender"" by Blur or ""Under Pressure"" by Bowie/Queen the same way ever again. Surprisingly inventive story-telling, seamlessly mixing naturalistic techniques like found-footage with surrealism and a non-linear narrative. The effect is to get you inside the heads of the two protagonists and witness their relationship in all its beauty and pain. It may have been a little slow at the beginning, and although he more than makes up for it with a towering performance, Paul Mescal looks a little fresh to be a stressed 30 year old. But no film is perfect, and this comes closer than anything I have watched in a long time. A film for anyone who has, or ever has had, a parent.",1
154,"Paul Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio star in Charlotte Wells' triumphant feature debut ""Aftersun"".  The film brings an intimate portrayal of a father's relationship with his daughter to the screen, whilst also capturing a holiday experience that British viewers will be all too familiar with. Wells draw on her own experiences for the film, with her own feelings and memories blending with fiction to create gut-wrenching emotion and a poignant story.

The film, set in the late 1990s, follows 11-year-old Sophie (Frankie Corio) and her father Calum (Paul Mescal) as they go on vacation together in Turkey. Sophie views the world differently to her father, being on the cusp of adolescence with her biggest worry being going back to school and doing her homework, while Calum sees the world under the weight of his declining mental health and responsibilities of being a father. Years later, Sophie is now an adult herself, and reminisces on the vacation she took with her father through both real and imagined memories, as well as rewatching DVR footage of their time abroad. With Calum seemingly no longer involved in Sophie's life, she reflects on the relationship she had with her father, seeing him in a new light with the knowledge and intelligence she now has as an adult. 

Paul Mescal delivers a spectacular performance as Calum, the Irishman acts with evocation and emotion, crafting a performance that is easily one of 2022's best, and very worthy of an Oscar nomination. Mescal and his 12-year-old co-star Frankie Corio, brilliantly bounce off each other's performances, creating an on-screen bond that feels incredibly real and intimate. They radiate youth and authenticity, with both performers working together to balance the powerful emotion with enjoyable humour. Corio, who makes her acting debut in the film, holds her own against her BAFTA-winning co-star, delivering an outstanding performance that effortlessly draws you into every scene. 

Cinematographer George Oke, known for his work on short films like ""Alice"" and ""In a Room Below,"" works with Wells to craft delectable visuals for the film, with Oke's work skilfully exploring the film's themes, observing them through a warm-toned colour palette. As well as directing, Wells pens the screenplay for the film, producing a well-paced and empathetic screenplay that beautifully elevates both the film itself, as well as the performances. ""Aftersun"" covers a myriad of themes during its 102-minute runtime, from childhood and parenthood to memory and mental health, while also depicting a difficult relationship between a father and his daughter. The result of the film's sprawling themes coming together in harmony is a powerful drama that feels incredibly simple, while also being deeply complex, and packing an emotional punch for viewers. 

""Aftersun"" is a sensational directorial debut from Charlotte Wells. Lead by knockout performances from Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio, the film is a profound drama that paints an intimate portrait of a father daughter relationship that tugs on your heartstrings. The film is accompanied by a wonderful score by Oliver Coates (""Significant Other""), that is full of melodic tones that work in harmony with each other. ""Aftersun"" forces its audiences to deal with feelings of love and loss, as well as a plethora of themes that will tug on your heartstrings and leave you teary-eyed by the time the credits roll. This is a film that quickly earns it spot among the year's best, from the performances to the technical aspects, everything works hand in hand to create a stellar film. 

More reviews can be found on my website (Mollysfilmreviews.com)",1
155,So overrated and overhyped. Boring.,0
156,Fabulous acting and setting but did anyone else find the level of camera focus on Sophie's face and body inappropriate? She is on the cusp of adolescence yes and I appreciate how this fits into the story but still it seemed over-lingering to me for an 11 year old child.,1
157,"Mesmerisingly beautiful with subtle and poignant storytelling, gorgeous cinematography and outstanding performances. A film that really stayed with me.",1
158,This film is one of those rare ones you will never forget and you will be thinking about for days afterward. I can't wait till it streams so I can rewatch it because much of the story requires reading between the lines. There are so many unanswered questions and that is Charlotte Wells's intention. Everything is not laid out for you neatly on a plate. The pace of the movie moves slow and steady with an unexpected gut punch at the end. Paul Mescal is brilliant in this role.,1
159,Refreshing.  Bit of a dig at the movie business.   Bet they had fun shooting it.   And as for the wig they put on Penelope Cruz- great fun.,1
160,"Too tentative, overwrought. Artificial without the (emotional) intelligence to match.
Cerebral wit without fun.
An audiovisual load of overthinking.",0
161,"Official Competition has quite a clever premise, and is both handily made and well-acted, but it often overstays its welcome and fails to properly handle its bigger stakes.",0
162,"I like the scene of dancing which occured in front of the bed of Lola. I watched it mainly for its Production Design, Costume Design and Cinematography. I was curious about the story. I watch movies on evenings.",1
163,"Exceptional film! A must see! Wonderful from beginning frame to end credits. All around brilliance. One of the best films of the year, and in the top films of the past 20 years -- if not longer.",1
164,"A different side of Penélope Cruz, the comedic side which we barely see and is sooo good. The script was okay with a lot of comedic undertone, yet sometimes quite monotonous. Banderas and Martínez have great, dueling chemistry.",1
165,"I was not ready for the amount of drama, story, aesthetic and great acting this film had in store. The best of film of 2022, and definitely underrated. Cruz delivers an amazing performance, despite the questionable wig.",1
166,How anyone could enjoy that is beyond me!,0
167,"Clever, funny, witty and slick. All three main characters bounce off each other effortlessly with a great supporting cast. Perhaps the best film of the year.",1
168,A dark comedy that will leave you shocked.  The three leads are perfectly cast.  It's witty and stylistic.  Highly recommend checking it out.,1
169,I draw the line when I comes to depiction of animal cruelty. This was just not it.,0
170,Brilliantly horrible.,1
171,"Absolutely terrible movie. 10/10 would not recommend. There was no real plot happening in this movie and by the end of it I find myself wondering what the point of this movie was. I genuinely cannot understand why this was given such a high score. The only reason I am giving it any stars at all is because the children acting in this movie did a very good job in their given roles, but over all this movie was a complete waste of my time.",0
172,"Pretty good. Wish I didn’t have to read, but it’s a decent film. Definitely very good acting by the kids.",1
173,Just another superhero film but without  the exitemente of a superhero film,0
174,"Its dumb, there are creepy moments, but it makes no sense hast no real ending. It hast not really a Story... wasted time",0
175,This film was....difficult. And extremely uncomfortable in parts. I'm honestly not sure what to make of it besides being fairly sure I don't want to watch it again despite it not being in any way bad. It's certainly an odd one.,0
176,"An absolutely astounding group of young actors. This movie would fall apart with a weak link - fortunately, there were none to be found. A chilling, gut-wrenching story that will stick with me for quite some time. Tragic in the shakespearean sense. Ultimately life-affirming and a celebration of those who are ""different"". Maybe the best movie I've seen this year.",1
177,"When you look deeper into the situation, there will be a good child, a bad child, a soul mate and a victim. From the perspektive of the good girl, her naivity is a child property, she will find the only weapon against the bad guy in her soul mate sister. She acts as a director to show her ways into reality out of her own introverted complex world where informations only coming inside.",1
178,"The film keeps a steady, well established pace, with no major climaxes. In any other movie it would've become boring real quick but it works like a charm for this one. You'll feel uneasy the whole movie especially with the ending.",1
179,There is a lot of cruelty to animals depicted in this film. Very dark and upsetting for me.,0
180,"It's a story about a lost boy on an adventure, but the boy is a donkey and it's directed by the Polish Terrence Malick",1
181,The movie started off okay but then it all seemed to become very disjointed and hard to follow. I know the director was trying to make a statement but I just didn't understand how some of the scenes related to the movie overall. It's not a movie I would recommend to anyone.,0
182,I found the movie terribly sad and I was upset by the ending.  It's a pretty bleak picture of the callousness and cruelty with which humans treat animals and the many ways we don't protect them.  It was beautifully filmed and very moving.,1
183,Amazingly universal and so adorable. And funny too! A great film.,1
184,I felt lectured too and manipulated. It started off interesting enough with some real potential.. kind of like a like a nouvo kitchen sink realism film with animals. But just plain went bleh.,0
185,Unbelievably beautiful and touching. See it!,1
186,"horrible, this movie is very over hyped",0
187,don’t like it at all,0
188,"this movie was not good. lacked story, and everything a movie should have",0
189,"Although it took a little while to let go of all the questions/confusion I had at first, when I really got into it, it was incredible. The film is a whole vibe, more than a linear story, although there is a story in there. It's visionary, poetic, stunningly beautiful, insightful and clever. I can't stop thinking about it & want to watch it again.",1
190,Not my thing. Went completely over my head.,0
191,"SWAN (Saul Williams and Anisia Uzeyman) has molded nothing less than a luminous masterpiece; a heartbeat transferred to film.  Hypnotizing from start to finish, Neptune Frost is a strong contender for movie of the year.

If you struggle with reading subtitles following abstract art, or lack a taste for poetry, this one's probably not for you.",1
192,"I would so liked to have given this ambitious indie offering a higher score, but, unfortunately, because of clarity conflicts between narrative and screenplay, I simply couldn't. This Afrocentric musical fantasy with a multitude of themes protesting war, corporate greed, social intolerance and a host of other issues definitely has its heart in the right place, with inventive special effects and cutting-edge musical stylings. However, its attempt to express itself through cryptic poetic dialogue and soliloquies obscures its messages with its often-indecipherable prose. I sincerely applaud the attempt to push the envelope of the script, but, when the mixed metaphor wording becomes so irretrievably gnarled and vague, it's difficult to figure out exactly what the screenwriter is seeking to say. Directors Anisia Uzeyman and Saul Williams are clearly on to something here, but they need to clean it up a bit to make the material more coherent and accessible, with writing that's on par with the superb quality of everything else this innovative release has to offer.",0
193,You've never seen anything like Neptune Frost and it's worth watching for that reason alone. I don't think I'd watch it again but I'm glad that I got to see something truly original.,1
194,"I'm getting less patient with these high-concept, image & metaphor-driven arthouse flicks. Far too much random, nebulous, overly subjective content. Just nonsensical 'dialogue'/lines thrown out (unanimous goldmine, we all know our fathers...mother and father were binary stars... blah, blah, blah). Went from nearly having a story line that had a serious point, to jumping back & forth into disjointed, unconnected scenes. It was like reading overlty symbolist or beat poetry where 10 ppl can read it and give 10 different interpretations. There's no solid grounding to that. It was surely made with a point(s)/ideas, but it comes off as arty twaddle/indulgence. 
I get the intent that they had with the hacking and the takeover they wanted/needed, but they didn't go on and fulfill any of it. Just felt extremely random, incoherent (Innocent is here, then sent away. Why not use him? What's with the nebulous talk about what the Motherboard is? Why the need for the sexual advances, one more like a would-be assault? 
2.3 stars",0
195,I wish there was an English dub in the film.,0
196,Inventive and moving film.,1
197,"Definitely need to see it again. It pounded out politics, philosophy and art with rhythm. It moves pretty fast with magical colors. Stunning and much food for thought if you are open to it.",1
198,"I loved the visual, the songs and the message but got a bit confused by the story.",1
199,"On the horror side, Sissy clearly brings a new twist to the slasher genre while brilliantly capitalizing on the new communication trends of today's social media. The kills are excellent, the plot is original and builds to a crescendo, and the film brings new twists to old formulas. On the story side, Sissy plays with psychological ambiguity and interestingly addresses questions about psychological balance and well-being, harassment and rejection, and self-love. A successful combo!",1
200,it was pretty entertaining with a wicked twist,1
201,I couldnt get into this movie at all. It was weird and I couldnt tell what it wanted it to be. I ended falling asleep after trying 3 times. I was finally able to sit through it all and i still dont know what it was about. Boring.,0
202,Went into this one a little skeptical but really ended up enjoying it. One of the better horror movies I watched this year. It is worth a watch.,1
203,"Woahhh this movie is the largest waste of time I would have rather bridge bungee jumped onto a spiked dildo then put my eyes through this torture
again. Please spend your night watching literally anything else hell if you are planning on watching this just go to bed you are obviously sleep deprived.",0
204,This movie is terrible waste of time,0
205,Extremely overrated. The ending was pretty good and gory but the road to get to it is pretty lame.,0
206,"In recent years we have seen the rise of so-called ""influencers"" who use social media platforms (like Tik Tok) to generate income and grow their personal brands. While some of these influencers are talented creators who have worked hard to build followings, others are simply people with large followings who are famous for being famous. Cecilia (played by Aisha Dee) falls into the latter category. She's a successful social media influencer with millions of followers, but she's not exactly a role model. She's self-centred and superficial, and her self-esteem is entirely dependent on the number of likes and comments she gets on her posts.

Cecilia's BFF from childhood, Emma (played by Hannah Barlow), invites her to come on her bachelorette weekend at a remote cabin in the mountains. It's the first time they've seen each other in years, and Cecilia is excited to reconnect with her old friend.  Unfortunately, things don't quite go as well as expected when Cecelia discovers Alex (Emily De Margheriti) is also at the party. Cecelia and Alex have a dark past, and Alex is not going to let that past go. The weekend quickly turns into a nightmare.

Sissy is a wickedly humorous satirical horror thriller that incisively explores the dark side of social media influencers and the lifetime impact of bullying. The cast is excellent, and the film is deliciously mean-spirited. If you're looking for a fun and twisted take on the influencer phenomenon, with some well-executed gore, then head to the cinema to see Sissy.",1
207,A real waste of time.,0
208,Overlong. I watched until the end but was glad I could skip past the many slow parts.,0
209,I was pleasantly surprised by the acting and the kind of story the director wants to tell.,1
210,An interesting insight of an African community that sadly lacks the powerful emotional strikes it should have hold. There is a big lack of empathy for both the lead characters that prevent you from being totally involved or deeply moved by what is going on. And mostly it has been done more strikingly in other entries but still worth a watch if you're into world cinema and want to keep your conscience awake of what is going on in our world.,1
211,"Lingui offers an emotional, inspiring look into the misogyny that exists in the country of Chad and how the women are fighting together to brave through those harsh circumstances. The movie is simplistic for better and for worse, but it is especially strong at conveying a strong sense of community and how important that unity is for these women.",1
212,"Saloum succeeds in mixing the genres of action, horror, adventure and thriller in an original plot, with distinct characters, and, above all, by surfing on cultural contexts under-represented on the screen. All this makes it worth watching.",1
213,"The suspense and tense building up in the beginning was so good. The raid, the flee, each everyone breathing on each others neck on the threats of betrayals comes to a more threatening tensions as the plane they fled with had to land to a place their leader familiar with, Saloum, Senegal where they met a long lost friend who retired military settled down in the remote village. The tension arise when the friend brought a resting police together. The fear of knowing anyone might know their crimes unfold one by one slowly. However, when the killing finally happened another nonsensical dark spirit haunt them instead.",0
214,"What a surprise! Mostly because I wasn't sure what to expect, nor was I sure I'd like a mercenary movie. But this one is so good. It's fun, it's haunting, it's tragic, it's even kind of sweet. I really just loved our four main charactes, one of whom is a deaf young woman. Seeing sign language from a whole other continent was really fun. We don't get that a lot in America. I want more.

And I had some feelings at the end. So, yes, recommend happily.",1

I enjoyed it. It moved fast and kept me interested. 
It isn't perfect, but it was Dope!",1
220,"Great genre bending movie with fantastic cinematography, compelling performances and an unpredictable (in a good way) script. Everyone should see this movie.",1
221,"Loved this film! The plot was full of unexpected twists, so my interest in what was happening on screen never diminished. The cast was excellent; Yann Gael, as Chaka, was particularly charismatic. It's not a horror film in the conventional sense; but there are plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments. The horror is strongly undergirded by the awful realities of life as a child soldier. There are many layers to this story. Don't make a popcorn run once it starts; you're likely to miss a crucial bit. This is a film I could (and will) watch multiple times and discover some details I previously   missed. I enjoyed the musical score; it seemed to flow seamlessly along with and enhance the action. Finally, I found the cinematography stunningly beautiful. I'm sure it helped that Saloum is such a gorgeous place. Prior to watching this film, I knew nothing about it. I have since done a bit of research and learned that it is a World Heritage Site renowned for its beautifully unique landscape. I think this is the best movie I've seen this year.",1
222,"It is totally unexpected to become so empathetic and so invested to the plight of an elderly couple, living in the highlands of Bolivia.

228,Michelle is A LEGEND YOU LITERALLY CAN NOT GO WRONG,1
229,"Such an amazing movie.  It's not what it seems that it is about, and it is almost impossible to describe.  It is visually amazing, the costumes are inventive and incredible, the editing is like I've never seen the acting is unmatched in any movie and the screenplay is profound.  How you can end up bawling your eyes out about two rocks on a cliff with subtitles is beyond me, and yet - there it is. You can't help but love and care about every character.  It is a mother daughter movie, it's about conflicts between generations - espcially in the Asian community, it is a love story and not just between husband and wife but between more complicated relationships.  It is about what if.  It is about the road not taken.  And it takes on multigeneraltional trauma and changing the narrative (a word I never say, but it is the right word).",1

231,"Not a dull moment. Well imagined, written, executed.",1
232,I didn't get it. Felt like I would have liked to have that time back.,0
233,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. The trailer looked cool. However, I actually left the movie early! I cannot believe how confusing, how boring, and how cheesy the movie was. Its a wanna be Matrix movie that takes you back to the same settings over and over again. Come on, lets move on. Got the idea. Nope, it keeps repeating. So bored that I actually left without finish watching it. 
It makes me wonder how did it get so high ratings? Thats part of the reason that I went to see it. But I felt like it was a waste of time and money.",0

235,One of the best movies this year!!!!!,1
236,"Awful. Definitely not my cup of tea, definitely not age appropriate for a young boy, was so bad I shut it off and there are far better movies than this, just my opinion!",0
237,Love it! Really funny and cute movie!!,1
238,"I feel that this movie could have a great potential, but chooses not to. First of all, the movie is filled with WAY too many inappropriate references. The movie could have a negative impact on young kids who are not experiencing the phases Meilin is going through. The movie also captures scenes when Meilin is disrespecting and talking back to her parents, specifically her mom, as well as sneaking out at night, running away, and selling red panda themed things behind her mom's back. Worst of all, she hides really unfitting things underneath her bed (For example, the money she earned from her 'Red Panda Project', ill suited drawings of boys, etc.), and lies constantly about foolish choices and mistakes she decided to do anyway. Overall, I definitely would not recommend this to anybody looking for a way to give their child a good example, as Turning Red is chocked with a ton of bad behaviour.",0
239,"This movie was an amazing one. The film touched my and my friend's hearts. As a middle schooler, my friends and I couldn't stop singing the songs for a whole year! This film is incredibly inclusive to all audiences. Awesome!",1

243,I appreciate the inclusive nature and the metaphor. The overreliance on the boyband drags it down from great to simply good.,0
244,"Turning Red started out kinda lame, but I stuck with it, & the ending didn't disappoint. It was a cute little fantasy with serious lessons baked in, & it was worth a look. I think Master Shi Fu would approve.",1
245,a beautiful and touching movie loved the look of it and music was perfect only problem was that the plot felt a bit weak as it tried to be a movie of a girl that wanted to sing again and got a chance to in U and also turned into a beauty and the beast movie and then switched to saving someone from domestic violence it did each enough service but when looking back it feels disjointed a must watch for the music and visuals but not much in the story department,1

255,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a must see for all! I took my five year old twins as well as my twenty three year old daughter to see it, and everyone was engaged throughout the whole movie. It was very funny and endearing, and filled with many components of a great movie!

260,"Fun, exciting and cute movie for the family.",1
261,Great movie! We enjoyed it so much!,1
262,I thought Puss in Boots The Last Wish was a super fun family movie. It even kept my 82 year old mother entertained and she falls asleep during every movie. Hope there will be another one soon,1
263,The best part about the movie was the dog and the Wolf,1
264,"The movie was entertainingly fun to it it was worth every single smile on my family's faces. The opening scene felt like a real 80s party, where everyone is having a good time...... Too bad the studio waited so long to make a sequel, they might be able to make an origin story to how he became our favorite fearless hero......",1
265,"As the clock of life ticks by, many of us begin to look back on our lives in terms of the opportunities we pursued and the regrets we hold over those we didn't. Those are the primary themes explored in writer-director Max Walker-Silverman's debut feature about a pair of childhood friends (Dale Dickey, Wes Studi) who reunite after many years apart at a remote Colorado campground. Their time together gives them a chance to reflect upon their lives, their memories and the loves they both lost. But where do they go from here now that they've reconnected? This tender, bittersweet arm's-length romance has its moments of humor, compassion and joyful reunion, as well as its elements of stilted awkwardness and protracted hesitation, reflecting the ambiguity the two principals are feeling after their long separation. It makes for some interesting dynamics set against the beautifully photographed backdrop of the Western wilderness. However, despite these strengths, the script feels a little thin with an underdeveloped narrative and back story, issues that are slightly exacerbated by the picture's slow but tolerable pacing. While it's true this offering proves that a film doesn't always need a complex, densely packed screenplay chock full of dramatic heft to be effective, it nevertheless seems that ""A Love Song"" could have benefitted from a little more substance. Still, this one has its merits, having deservedly earned Independent Spirit Award nominations for Dickey's lead performance and as a candidate for the competition's John Cassavettes Award. This is the kind of film that makes a good choice for a cozy weekend afternoon while curled up on the couch, and, thankfully, its economical 1:21:00 runtime is just long enough to make it enjoyable without becoming tedious – a nice little diversion without becoming tiresome.",1
266,Dale Dickey gives an outstanding performance in a beautiful love story with so much wisdom.,1
267,Outstanding performance by Dale Dickey in a beautiful love story that reveals so much wisdom.,1
268,"I  AM  familiar with both actors. Their performances were excellent but I found the movie's pace abysmal and the story very average.  It is of interest to see two old
people who knew each other when they were young and want to see if there is a spark in the present. It was actually pretentious to take so long between takes to get done what got done in the film.  I also thought the burial thing underneath her truck was contrived. Wes is a friend and an outstanding actor but  it did neither actor any favors to drag it out endlessly. I loved the ice cream cone scene..  on and on",0
269,I loved this film. Beautifully shot and acted.  Should get some consideration at the Independent Spirit Awards.,1
270,Sometimes the simplest story is the best one.,1
271,The cinematography is amazing. The movie slowly draws you into the longing that the characters feel for love and companionship while still facing their own personal obstacles to their own desire and passion.,1
272,"This is a slow moving but beautiful movie.  The performances are by the two leads are masterful and deep.  There are a few moments in the movie where it seems to be engaging in eccentricity for eccentricities own sake, but mostly it is a moving study of loss and longing.",1
273,Career-defining and awards-worthy performances by familiar Dickey and Studi. A sparse character-driven screenplay that is well-matched by the quiet and insular performances. The cinematography is splendid. A very welcome break from noisy blockbusters.,1
274,"This was probably THE MOST BORING movie I have EVER seen.  If this is a love story I'll eat my hat.  What you get in the beginning is the same scene over and over and over again of her putting out crab traps, pulling them in, cooking the crab & eating them.  Maybe 15 minutes of that.  After that you finally get the ""love of her life"" showing up and nothing happens.  A little SLOW dialog.   More repetitive scenes that are boring over & over.  We left the theatre finally and wish we had done so ten minutes in.  Really, truly a nothing movie.",0
275,This movie is awesome. Another Iranian move that shows the level of Iranian directors and their films.,1
276,Beautiful movie. Great actors. One of my all time favorites. Laughing and crying simultaneously..,1
277,"The debut of Panah Panahi is brilliant at times and a fantastic addition to Iranian filmmaking.  It is a family road trip film that is tragic, funny and relatable.  There are long takes and scenes where the camera is far away.  Then out of nowhere is a tangent that seems like it is from another movie, but yet totally works!  Powerful, gentle and a hopeful beginning to Panahi's future!  Final Score: 8/10",1
278,Wonderful acting.  Very funny dialogue.  Unusual story plot.  Breathtaking scenery-,1
279,"This film is quite touching and poignant but only really towards the end - I wasn't overly bothered about it for the most part before then. It depicts a day in the life of a family on a road trip, with their domestic issues and arguments. The young boy was relatively amusing (his energetic enthusiasm at times is certainly somewhat infectious), with some witty dialogue, drawing on the car windows and such like. The scene I really liked showed him cuddling up to his father in a warm jacket/top on the ground, with hail stones landing nearby.",1
280,An absolutely wonderful movie!,1
281,"Beautifully filmed in a stunning and (to someone living in Ireland) spectacular landscape, at turns whimsical and tragic, this film shows the cruel",1
282,"Excellent, beautifully shot, and for a debut director really impressive.",1
283,Hit the Road is a film that came with much acclaim but sadly it didn't really connect with me at all. This Iranian road film never feels insightful or compelling in anyway. A group of four are on the open road in Iran. An older woman and man and their twenty something son and their even younger son. Plus an ailing dog. At first we don't know the reason behind the trip but eventually we learn that the older son is leaving the country in secret. The plot is quite thin so a film like this relies on interesting dialogue and some wit and charm. Sadly it's never really received as this family is excruciatingly annoying. Especially the youngest son. I really wanted this film to just end.,0
284,"HIT THE ROAD by Iranian director Panah Panahi (who also wrote it) is about a boring family on a boring road trip across a boring landscape. Mum tries to laugh, but sometimes she can't help the tears that run down her face. Meanwhile, in the back seat, Dad is nursing a broken leg and the youngest belts out car karaoke. The only quiet one is the older brother. The family is hit by one problem after another, but they just keep going. All these elements may make it sound like an interesting movie. But, while the cinematography is gorgeous, and the little boy, played by Rayan Sarlak, is a scene-stealer, the film feels long and slow. There's no real plot or character development and for most of the movie, we have no idea what the purpose of the trip is which means the events on the trip a without context.

If you're in the mood for a visually stunning but ultimately frustrating film, HIT THE ROAD might be for you. Otherwise, skip it.",0
285,"'Gagarine' was first a short documentary French film turned into a feature length fictional drama.  It should have stayed a short as this was stretched and mostly unenjoyable.  When you only have 45 minutes (AT MOST) of material or words on the page you simply can't expect a 97 minute feature to work. The movie once again shows the disconnect between the real people watching movies and elitist critics.  Newcomer Alséni Bathily turns in an eye-opening performance as Yuri which is the best part of the picture.  Too many unexplained montages in a film that is way too contemplative. With supporting characters criminally underdeveloped and the stakes never really explained, 'Gagarine' in a colossal wasted chance to put the underserved in focus.  That focus should have been SOLELY on people displaced from their homes and relationships potentially altered forever. Giant swing and a miss.  Final Score: 3/10",0
286,"""Balancing whimsy-tinged magic realism against serious themes of community and displacement, Gagarine is as bracingly original as it is ultimately poignant"" (RT). Suffused with an extraordinary demure halo, glocal, mic-mac, innernaut-cosmonaut maximized from the banlieue to the moon and from deep space to the suspended return: a memorable debut. 
(Mauro Lanari)",1
287,"This film has a lovely dreamlike feel to it. It depicts young adults trying to escape their barren surroundings, dreaming of a better, more exciting life, wondering what may exist, to be explored in space. I suppose in a way its an example of a compelling escapist, or immersive, film, that does well at pulling the viewer in to the world of the characters on screen. I can certainly relate to having a curious imagination. It is a bit of an arty film, so possibly may be a little too abstract for some peoples taste but its definitely got a nice warmth to it, which I enjoyed. I particularly liked the library footage of space explorations shown in between scenes set on Earth and the floaty/dreamlike music softly played in the background at times. I also liked the use of bright colours, particularly red, to emphasise some brief scenes as depicting imagined scenarios.

Yes, I'd recommend this film.",1
288,Gagarine is an intriguing and beautiful film. One that combines realism with magic with great skill. Set in Cite Gagarine in Paris it concerns itself with a group of young friends coming to terms with losing their home. Cite Gagarine are high rise apartments built in the 1970s and named after famed Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The main character is named Youri too and he is a 16yo boy trying to keep the block of apartments afloat by undertaking repairs. The commnunity wants to keep the block alive but the council is determined to demolish them. Youri also has a fascination with space and the film blends quite well the realistic nature of everyday life and his 'magic world' of looking to the stars. Alseni Bathily is superb in the lead role. This is a lovely film that was compelling to watch.,1
289,"When a rundown housing project on the outskirts of Paris is slated for demolition, its predominantly low-income immigrant residents face forced eviction and relocation. But one occupant resists. As an aspiring astronaut, 16-year-old Youri tries to save the complex of high-rises named in honor of Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin, the first man in space and the youngster's namesake. But, when the clock runs out, he must scramble to survive as the project's only remaining resident. It's at this point, though, when the picture loses its way, turning somewhat preposterous. And, the longer it goes on, the more the film turns surreally preposterous, mixing fantasy and reality in a fuzzy, disjointed way, leaving viewers wondering how the two actually mesh. The result is an unsatisfying disappointment, almost as if directors Fanny Liatard and Jérémy Trouilh ultimately didn't know where to take their debut feature. That's regrettable, given that their production seemed to start off with a promising premise that lost its legs part way through. It's commendable to dream for the stars, but you have to have a flight plan in place before you launch, something that's sorely lacking here.",0
290,"Here in the U.S., housing projects are place for our government to say we're doing good things for people while in reality we are hiding and warehousing the things we don't want to see - generational poor, unskilled, immigrants - away from us. Gagarine suggests that it's pretty much the same in France. Like an abused child or spouse who won't leave their abuser, some residents cling to their soon to be demolished cesspool of despair and decay. Sadly, neither the movie nor the characters go anywhere. Interesting technique and editing, but lacking story.",0
291,"Very good, It's like a ""new Suspiria""",1
292,Perfect amount of creepy. Really enjoyed it!,1

296,"This is an overly ambitious movie, a melange of mythical themes, and lots of surreal Art Basel style performances. Unfortunately for the viewers, this get the tumbled, jumbled treatment from director and writer Travis Stevens. Low budget, heavy handed, clunky, amateurish at best, throw in some truly awful, cheesy production and silly effects design and voila; a boring, laughable, stupid ""Arthouse"" film. A compelling, clever horror, it is absolutely not.",0
297,"Hmmm…not quite sure what I just watched. To me it was a bit of mess, despite how artfully intriguing the movie is (according to so-called expert critics). I liked Sarah Hind in this but she ‘went walkabout' for too much of the middle stages of the movie - she was the glue holding the movie together in my opinion…without her, it lost direction. Sure it was low budget, but this day and age you really have to get the blood right, especially when there's so much of it. It was too red and paint-like, came across very amateurish and detracted from the realism the producers were trying to create.",0
298,A complete mess. The director watched some Argento movies and threw them in a blender. Then he had all his friends and family write glowing pseudo-intellectual and sophomoric reviews. Avoid at all costs and don't say you weren't warned.,0

323,"The key to making a good thriller is to offer an intriguing, twist-filled story but not one that becomes so convoluted that it becomes indecipherable. And that's where writer-director Park Chan-wook's latest comes precariously close to losing it. Mind you, the picture manages to keep itself from careening over the edge, but, in its valiant attempt to offer something more than just a prototypical suspense saga, it introduces a wide range of elements that can make following the flow of the narrative somewhat challenging at times. That's further complicated by a screenplay that tends to jump around more than it needs to, especially in the opening half-hour during that critical phase where the movie is establishing itself. Thankfully, those rough patches get smoothed out as the story goes on, enabling the film to ultimately live up to its thriller designation, even if it takes a little longer than it probably needs to in doing so. Still, this tale of a detective investigating a possible homicide who becomes obsessed with the victim's widow (a prime suspect in the case) serves up a generally compelling yarn whose title is ably reflected in many of the picture's diversely interwoven story threads. It's also refreshing to see a film in this genre play itself out with an ample amount of offbeat humor and inventive camera work, something all too infrequently included in pictures of this stripe. Nevertheless, ""Decision To Leave"" could have used a little more fine-tuning to make it work more effectively and more truly deserving of the many awards and accolades it has received thus far. It's a fun watch with some intriguing elements that distinguish it from its peers, but it's not quite everything it could be as movies in this genre go.",1
324,Such a beautiful noir romance. Definitely Recommend!,1
325,"One of the sexiest films of the year even though it is one of Park Chan-wook's most chaste movies. It has the twist and turns of a soap opera, with a great love story that switches seamlessly between the comedy and tragedy, an intriguing murder mystery, and two delightful lead performances oozing with charisma, all in the framework of a film noire. Tang Wei as the femme fatale Song Seo-rae is mesmerizing. Whenever she is on screen she commands it and you can't possibly take your eyes off of her. Park Hae-il as Detective Jang Hai-joon counters that with charm and sincerity. Their scenes together are magic and you root for their love to Prevail. The dialouge is really interesting here whether spoken or in text. The language barrier between the Chinese immigrant Seo-rae and Hai-Joon plays a pivotal role in both bringing them closer and keeping them apart. Park Chan-wook's directs the hell out of this film. His camera puts the viewer in the right place in the right time, and the film is the better for it. The editing is bold and flashy. I also loved the score, and that recurring song ""The Mist"" is one of best musical needle drops of the year. 

I really loved this film, and I am only sorry that I missed seeing it during its run in Red Sea International National film Festival earlier this month, because this is a feast for the eyes, and it should have been experienced in the big screen.",1

359,"I am a huge fan of Bill Nighy and was looking forward to this but I think we should just remind ourselves here that Nighy can do parts like this falling off a log. He has just the right amount of self deprecating disdain, and is guaranteed to underplay virtually everything to great effect. But to be honest I didn't think the screenplay was good enough. There could have been far more resonance.  The scenes where he goes AWOL on the south coast were probably the least convincing and his relationship with the young girl at the office could have been so much more rewarding. We see him actually getting something done before he dies, but we only glimpse at him being deliberately obstructive earlier on. We see him failing with the young girl but we have not seen him soldiering on alone with no one. The film was based on a novel and so often films from novels do not really work. I would say this is a perfect example.",0

Literalmente es la historia de una niña morena, con trastorno de personalidad múltiple, o al menos es lo que creo que quería plasmar el pelmazo que escribió el guión, pues pasa de ser aventurera a miedosa, y de repente lo sabe TODO. Y curiosamente no necesita ningún tipo de arco para aprender nada, pues es un personaje perfecto, mientras los hombres blancos y privilegiados son unos tontos nada más porque sí  xDD. Eso sin mencionar que al final incita a la desobediencia civil, da un golpe de estado casi ""sin querer queriendo"", y al final nos enseña que un niño de apenas ocho años tiene mayor juicio que un señor de casi 50, que ha vivido toda su vida en el mar.

386,"Ah, que delícia de filme! É um longa que mistura comédia e investigação numa dosagem perfeita. E se eu já tinha gostado do primeiro, esse me conquistou muito. Isso porque aqui as reflexões do anterior são consolidadas e complementadas. Eu simplesmente adoro a personificação de Enola Holmes na pele de Millie Bobby Brown - essa menina atua bem demais e com certeza vai nos presentear com muitas atuações memoráveis. Aqui, acompanhamos uma Enola mais madura, enfrentando um problema que infelizmente é real até hoje, ainda que de formas diferentes - o machismo. O longa nos mostra a tentativa da personagem de se consolidar como investigadora e penando muito por ser mulher, jovem e ter um irmão famoso da área. Para isso pouco importa se ela é boa ou não. E isso se estende até o final, que não é tão feliz quanto deveria, porque Enola Holmes não se torna extremamente bem-sucedida - o que é bem realista e traz uma sensação amarga necessária. Gosto demais, também, das interações de Sherlock (Henry Cavill) com Enola Holmes, aqui sem o chato do Mycroft (Sam Claflin). O filme peca um pouco, pra mim, na ação, que é mais presente aqui que no primeiro. Mas em nenhum momento eu esperava um filme de ação e, por isso, não há prejuízo para a trama. O romance continua não sendo o foco, ainda que seja desenvolvido e consolidado aqui. E isso é algo que muito me agrada. Enfim, eu curti demais e veria mil outros filmes desse grupo!",1
387,Love this take on the Sherlock Holmes world. It's fun and the plot is pacy. Mille Bobby Brown is likeable and bubbly as Enola and Henry Cavill is as good a Sherlock as he is Superman.,1
388,Even wittier than the first one! I enjoyed it and the storytelling. I like the balance of Sherlock being in the movie but still mostly about Enola. I hope they make a third one. One of the few movies where I think the second was better than the first but both are great. ,1
389,Benign good spirited fun but a bit too much like Sherlock Holmes meets St Trinians for my liking,1

396,"Love stories have been a staple of the movie industry almost as long as there have been movies. But, for such releases to truly stand out, they must offer something of their own to distinguish themselves in this genre. Writer-director Clio Barnard's latest does its level best to achieve that, but, regrettably, it comes up short. Set in a working class neighborhood of Bradford, West Yorkshire in the north of England, the film follows the choppy, often-meandering relationship of its two title characters, a widowed, middle-aged immigrant Irish Catholic grandmother and a younger British-Pakistani would-be musician who's separated from his wife. In entering into their passionate but tentative romance, Ali and Ava are each carrying their fair share of baggage (conditions that no doubt contribute to their hesitancy to become deeply involved) while attempting to cope with outside issues related to cultural taboos and less-than-subtle racism. However, despite the picture's efforts at creating distinctive characters operating under a distinctive set of circumstances, the narrative never comes together as cohesively as it might have, yielding a patchwork of moments of varying degrees of intensity and engagement, a mix that doesn't quite gel. For every scene that effectively draws in viewers, there are just as many that are shallow, extraneous throw-aways. What's more, the story lines related to the outside issues aren't developed nearly as fully as they could have been. To be sure, the film features fine performances by Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook as the two leads, but, considering the ample critical acclaim that has been lavished on this offering, as well as its two BAFTA Award nominations, ""Ali & Ava"" nevertheless proves to be something of a disappointment. This attempt at creating a profound love story could have benefitted greatly from some much-needed shoring up in a number of key areas – especially as an offering in a genre that inherently calls for distinction to genuinely stand out.",0
397,"Loved this film, beautifully filmed and acted by all, a gentle, engaging treat.",1
398,"Clio Barnard's Bradford-set drama, as indicated from its title, revolves around Adeel Akhtar's Ali, a kind but slightly aimless Pakistani amateur musician, and Claire Rushbrook's Ava, an Irish/Caucasian teacher's assistant and young(ish) grandmother of five. They are the quintessential chalk and cheese couple down to their musical tastes (he dances to rave music on top of his car and she enjoys country and folk) but they also share a messiness in life and a loneliness bore out of their circumstances, with tightly held secrets that are eventually teased out as the film slowly unfolds. Building upon a Loachian blueprint grounded in working-class realism, the effective camerawork is unfussy and unintrusive, while Akhtar and Rushbrook who have been solidly reliable character actors for anything they're in on big and small screens, give us tremendous performances that are layered and moving. Barnard's use of their contrasting musical tastes as a narrative device is inspired, as we see them first introducing each other to their playlists and as their relationship deepens, they try assimilating their taste to one another. As a celebration of multiculturalism and a portrait of a relationship between two adults who had lived a life before they met, Barnard's screenplay touches on aspects we expected it to: race, objection from family members, the hesitancy of middle-aged courtship. However they are handled gently and humorously while steering clear of sentimentality and troupes that can easily turn this into a lesser, more generic melodrama. So it's a huge let-down when it drops one of the worst cliché in its run-up to the ending, contriving a misunderstanding between them that's resolved in a quick yet still abstract indie film manner. It's a cringing and unnecessary move that ruined the film for me, as an almost 4-stars rating plummets to a barely 3.",0
399,"Claire Rushbrook and Adeel Akhtar are marvellous in a very understated film. Ali and Ava is a refreshing and original take on the 'rom com'. It is funny, sweet and charming and a film I would re-watch with pleasure. Writer and director Clio Barnard does an excellent job and continues to build an impressive filmography. The film is in the social-realist vain of Ken Loach and other British filmmakers and is all the stronger for its lack of narrative through line. Instead, the film becomes a series of slice of life scenes where character and relationship is its focus",1
400,"This is a very entertaining movie! It has it all, the history, the action, the sorrow, the laughter, and the romance! Great actors! Action packed 3 hours. True enjoyment!",1
401,"Probably the greatest theatre going experience of my life. This movie is a ballistic thrill ride, filled with heart, jokes, and some of the best action scenes I've ever seen.

433,"Emma Thompson is such a treasure. Watching her metamorphosis and emerge whole, at peace with herself literally standing naked in front of a mirror with her actual late 50's body in all of its aging glory is a magical, unvarnished cinematic moment.  Yes it's essentially a two person play more than a movie, but the subtle nuances and watching Thompson struggle with herself is enormously helped by the director and deft editing.",1
434,"Vi pessoas comentando esse filme, logo por curiosidade fui assisti-lo, acabei amando o filme. Que personagens maravilhosos, os atores também! A história é simples e entrega tudo que tem que entregar.",1
435,There isn't a whole lot here despite its well intentions and two great performances.,0
436,An absolute delight ! Engrossing in its theme and sensibility in acting by Emma Thompson & Daryl McCormack ( He is delicious !) . A refreshing take on sexual exploration - elegant and human . Must see !,1
437,"Emma's a great actress - and McCormack holds his own. But the premise of the movie, that pleasure is the pinnacle of happiness (and that sex workers are doing everyone a favor) is silly. The connection that they built, especially through sharing their pain, was cheapened by an implied answer that pleasure is found within yourself. They should've fast forwarded another year and shown Emma as still unhappy and lonely.",0
438,Excellent acting by both Emma and Darryl. So much story with few people and mostly one set. Loved the writing and the pacing. Opens our eyes again to how people can build relationship with focus on sex and not sex.,1
439,I couldn't watch. The very boring and long beginning.,0
440,Loved it! A very moving story. Great acting.,1
441,I really enjoyed it.  Wished it was a little longer. More time with such interesting characters.,1
442,Loved this movie. I have made a Rotten Tomatoes' account just so I can tell you that! I went to see this movie today. It was a joy to watch from beginning to end. The parts of both Nancy and Leo are acted incredibly skilfully by Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack. The authenticity of their characters shone through. It was so refreshing to watch - a breath of fresh air in the midst of the tsunami of ham acting that seems to have become the norm on so many platforms. Bravo to all involved!,1

452,Great basketball scout movie. Adam Sandler's performance very good. Great story line.,1
453,A profoundly moving character study.,1
454,"The movie was done very tastefully.  I thought it started off a bit slow, but, I guess they had to set the scene.",1
455,This was an incredibly slow movie.  I have never felt a WWI-related movie (of which I have seen many) was done so badly.  The jumping back and forth in time wasn't well-used either.  Pick a topic related to Sassoon and stick with it.  Argh.,0
456,No idea what I just watched. Save yourself and run.,0
457,"Long, boring story of a talented man who was drawn to all kind of gay men, but the one he wanted most thru his whole life was unfaithful, unkind, and arrogantly evil. Why the heck couldn’t he choose one of the guys who was morale, loving, and faithful, like he claimed to be? Utterly hopeless and depressing movie!",1
458,"This is a beautifully made movie the weaving of the poetry and the contemporary films of the horrors of the Great War, World War I, work wonderfully to make a moving story of a man and his iconoclastic life.  The acting is superb, and the young man/old man juxtaposition works so much better than in most similar situations.",1
459,"If a most renowned poem inspired a motion picture the outcome would be something similar to this film. It's a whole river of emotions that are sharply animated through tremendous performances by the cast. You won't be alone is a story for all kinds of love. The trauma, misfortune is so immense it's heartbreaking yet the story enable us to see how beautiful a life can blossom how precious the brief moments are. Movie's flawless visuals capture every bit of main characters. Excellent use of background audio bringing a soothing effect to the mix. Emotion endearing voice overs are just sensational. What an excellent work of art fell in love.",1
460,"This movie SUCKS. Its SUPER boring. Its like the directly fell in love with how to make one scene and just it over and over and over again, like a kid who discovered something new.

464,A folk horror poem about human experiences,1
465,ery interesting and ambitious. Had some incredible moments with some eye popping moments as well. If you are a fan of horror this is a must watch.,1
466,"A truly original take on a very old and tired trope, this supernatural, atmospheric, slow burn gothic folk tale of witches and magic audaciously uses stillness, inner dialogue, and a setting straight out of the 19 century, to ask the age old question: What is the meaning of life? It has good performances, some light gore, and supernatural themes; but at it's core, it's a film about searching for the beauty and meaning of life itself. I'll concede that this film probably isn't for everyone. With a slow pace and sparse dialogue, some viewers may find it boring or confusing, and it's running time too long to hold their attention. But If you enjoy slow burn atmospheric horror films, gothic horror, supernatural horror, period piece or foreign horror films, this may be a film for you. For me, I found it borderline brilliant. One of the most original horror films I've ever seen, and one of the only ones that actually made me tear up. The cinematography is stunning, the performances nuanced, the themes fearlessly original and even heartbreaking at times; it's a film that lingers with you long after the credits have rolled.  Highly recommend it for the right kind of viewer.",1
467,"Boring as hell.
The Plot was just nonsense",0
468,"It's really good storytelling, not what everyone would expect... A befitting drama that takes your emotion into different phases and ends in a realisation on life. That living is difficult, yet you find out the answer yourself after you've watched it.",1

470,"Spoiler alert:  this comment contains the opinions that might give out the movie end. 

To me, this movie is about believing your heart.  Your eyes, your ears, the impressions, and surface feelings can fail you.  The bohemian society of Moscow professors who are highly intellectual and know their trivia turned out to be cruel and deceiving.  An ex-prisoner from a tiny compartment space, meeting with whom promised nothing but trouble, turned out to be a guardian angel.  And only being out in almost extreme everything (location, weather, state of mind—you name it) makes your heart see what's right for you.",1
471,"COLD WAR
If ever there was a movie for this time in history. This is it.

""Compartment No.6"" is the creaky train battle ground for a bright Fin and a bellicose Russian, brought together in uncomfortable circumstance. She solo tripping (after a partner bail) to check out ancient petroglyphs. He solo tripping for slavish mine work. Destination Murmansk, as frigid and unforgiving as a quick map query would suggest.

The student and the brute. Things don't start well. Booze fuelled and smoke ashes flying, Lhoja inflicts his boisterous party hardy manchild personality on a retreating and recoiling Laura. Cornered, she flees the dungeon compartment to find no sleeping alternatives. A rail ride from hell, perhaps to hell. Hell is involved it would seem.

Flip Finland for Ukraine (not much of a stretch in current and past circumstances) and we have a political allegory of current events - a bizarre coincidence. Yet this is more a personal clash where language, ideals, class, and gender are in play. Borders be damned.

Out of options, Laura reluctantly returns to her intended journey, keeping the clumsy Russian at arm's length, which proves difficult in their claustrophobic pad. Of course there is more to the simple boor that only time and patience could reveal, the train being the ideal vehicle for a relationship to develop. Where and how this cold war interaction of lost souls goes is the glorious guts of this stark, cramped film.

Yuriy Borisov and Seidi Haarla are pitch perfect as the strangers on a train, with little in common, much to despise, and yet an odd dependence that slips out every now and then. The human condition is a funny one, sometimes ha-ha, sometimes strange, and sometimes, if only briefly, confoundingly wonderful. This movie has all the feels, without ever slipping into sloppy cliche.

Nazdorovie!

- hipCRANK",1
472,Exquisite film. The description doesn't do it justice. It's captivating and I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
473,"Compartment No. 6 (Finnish: Hytti nro 6; Russian: Купе номер шесть) is a 2021 internationally co-produced drama film co-written and directed by Juho Kuosmanen 🚂 

It's good 🙂
I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼",1
474,"Compartment No. 6 tells the story of a woman who ends up in a train compartment with a man she does not know. The two of them start to talk and it quickly becomes apparent that they have a lot in common. As they continue to talk, the woman starts to realize that the man may be more than he seems. As the story progresses, the true nature of the man is revealed, and the woman must decide whether to trust him. 

The two lead performances are excellent, and the chemistry between the two actors is palpable. The film is visually stunning, and the setting of the train adds to the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia. Unfortunately, the arc of the story becomes predictable early on, and the pace is so slow that one needs to be very patient to get through it. Some may find the payoff rewarding but, for me, it left me feeling hollow. 

Compartment No. 6 is a well-acted and beautifully shot film that falls victim to its own predictability. If you are willing to take your time with it, you may find something to appreciate. However, if you are looking for a fast-paced thriller, you will be disappointed.",0
475,"Compartment No. 6 is a love story of sorts, a strange journey. It's a fascinating film that lives in its own world quite beautifully. Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen has made his latest film in Russia, although with a Finnish protagonist. That being Laura, played wonderfully by Seidi Haarla. Laura is studying archaeology in Moscow and decides to take the long train trip to Murmansk to study the famous petroglyphs (rock paintings). A relationship has also come to an end so its represents a good opportunity to escape the remnants of that. Her experience starts badly though as she has to share a compartment (No. 6) with a boorish and oafish Russian man. Unfortunately there is no escape and she has to make do with the situation. So transpires over a couple of days a journey of strange happenings and timely realisations. Somehow a strange bond forms between the two. It's a small journey but one with little twists through out. It's an unconventional film but I was compelled through out. As said Haarla is wonderful but so is Yuri Borisov as the Russian miner. This subtle film is wonderfully acted and written, a unique journey through the pitfalls of human connections.",1
476,"This is a romance movie and it's a bit of a problem if, like me, you simply do not believe the protagonists are likely romantic partners. In fact it is difficult to see they have anything much in common at all. So for me the film is much stronger in its portrayal of Russia the place and people than what we are invited to believe in. And in that respect it is brilliant and given the current situation, something we are not going to seeing again for a very long time.",1
477,"Cinema's romance with locomotives continues unabated with Finland's entry for International Features at last year's Oscars. The obvious comparisons are Before Sunrise and Brief Encounter, but non-train-related films like In The Mood For Love also cast a shadow here. Juho Kuosmanen's adaptation of Rosa Likson's novel sees two strangers thrown together in a confined space on a Soviet train bound for the arctic port of Murmansk, in a smartphone-less era where we still use camcorders and Walkmans. With Seldi Haarla's reserved Finnish archaeological student Laura missing the girlfriend she left behind in Moscow and Yuriy Borisov's intense and slightly mysterious Russian miner, Ljoha (a James McAvoy lookalike), making drunken and vulgar comments at Laura on the first night of their journey, the central characters are set up to be such polar opposites, and the stuff of nightmare for Laura to endure, it makes the inevitable softening of their initially antagonistic relationship all the more evocative and powerful. As mildly dramatic incidents draw them closer, it's less the romance but the human connection that blossoms subsequently that the film is interested in exploring, as even Yuliya Aug's stern and very Russian train conductor mellows towards her passengers. This is definitely more a mood piece than a narrative one and once you've made peace with that and the familiar narrative beats this film is sticking to, there's much to enjoy here, whether it's the sweet and subtle performances or the meticulous and immersive feeling this film recreates by shooting on location on a real moving train. If it's inevitable that the ending peters out a little once we left the train and the film navigates its way to that arthouse/European ending that strives for aching lyricism and ambiguity, the journey getting there was worth the price of the ticket.",1
478,"The excellent Compartment No. 6 places a woman on a long train journey in the company of a brute, vodka swilling male. The film examines issues of woman and culture contrasted to the posturing male of the Russian cult of Putinist machismo. Compared to the great heroes of Russia such as Yuri Gargarin, the Russian male, who now has Putinist kleptocrats as heroes, has fallen far. The hollowness of that masculinity is examined with the terrible price the men pay for it, and Yuriy Borisov is very good in that part, so that all is not lost. The price it also exacts from women is at the center of the film,  and in that Seidi Haarla is excellent: strong and vulnerable, cultured yet earthy, a little cynical yet open to the redemption of others, and very real. It is a testament to the script (and the film) and all those involved that while it is not nihilistic, nor is it satisfied by a monofocal or monotonal critical perspective. There are no easy answers offered, no get outs, no easy or lazy signposting. All is achieved though the characters, excellently written, performed, and filmed. An engrossing film that carries its weight lightly and doesn't betray humanity.",1
479,"Caleb Landry Jones is a revelation at the titular character and the film is a fascinating journey that highlights mental illness and it certainly makes you ask a lot of questions.  Based on a true story, the film is effective in portraying what happens when someone goes off his medications.  However then you wonder if it's the parents (Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia) who are trying to control their child.  It is a very well-told drama that borders on horror.  At times, it is freakingly chilling.  Final Score: 8.7/10",1
480,Amazing film - the Australian ouvre is so much better than the American,1
481,ok but dumb good acting but a lot of dead time,0
482,Caleb Jones was very good in this … dude plays a creep very well,1

Also,  This film carries on and really gets deep on current issues.  Really appreciated that.  Just a very interesting film.",1
484,"Fantastic acting performances and a tragic true story ground Nitram and make it hard to look away and hard to imagine. This film will assuredly hit Australians especially hard and I'd hope no one close to the situation will watch it. It is a dark character study, and a well done one at that. The film showing Nitram's (based on Martin Bryant who committed a mass shooting in 1996 in Tasmania, AU) inspiration from the Dublane mass shooting in the UK begs the question of what role does media (including this movie) play in inspiring violence, and I think this movie balances that dichotomy well despite it existing.",1
485,"I tried not to Google the story since it was based on a true event. Disturbing and yet the issues becoming more commonplace. Very well acted. Once I read about the story it was based on, I gave it 5 stars due to the director and writers' thoughtful and poignant portrayal  of the events.",1
486,"Psychopath millennial, unlikeable in every possible way, rampages through life satisfying his inner rage and macabre sense of humor about other people's pain.  This guy doesn't forget a wrong but also doesn't necessarily take it out on the offender but instead finds himself some ripe, innocent victims to satisfy his blood lust.  A walking, (barely) talking menace who in the old days was referred to as 'slow' in addition to some other names that aren't quite so politically correct.

Caleb Landry Jones executed a depth charge into the terrifying depths of his dark side in order to pull off this unthinkably sinister bully of a character.  

And Judy Davis was, as always, absolutely stunning.  I, for one, hang on her every word.  She's also got a way of staring into space that contains worlds of meaning.",1
487,"WOW! Cinematic genius! The depth, the creativity and pure talent in this movie is out of control. A must watch!",1
488,"A subtle and disturbing character examination. Kurzel is not engaging in cheap sensationalism (evidenced by the fact that the Port Arthur massacre, while acknowledged by the movie, is not openly portrayed beyond its beginning) and while the movie's entire focus is on the perpetrator rather than the victims I think that is a legitimate choice as one can plainly see the repeated patterns in these cases that are too often ignored by authorities.",1
489,"Definitely Gaspar Noe's most sentimental film. The director sure has a distinct way to bring his thoughts about life and it's inevitable end to camera in many distinct forms. All of the movies I've seen of him always contemplate life and death in various ways. It's hard for a person to bear it all alone, so it's great to see it addressed in cinema so you know you're not alone.",1
490,Heartbreaking and boring.,0
491,"Thinking that I was going to watch a ridiculous movie, I left the cinema with deep breaths. Dozens of things that I haven't experienced yet flashed before my eyes. It's tough to face the fact that we're all going to die someday tomorrow. We should at least try to live a good life. Gather around you people who love you and can benefit you. Some diseases have no cure. When it comes, you have to live. Most of us have different chronic diseases. We learn to live with them. Because life goes on. Regardless, it's beautiful. That's why live your life and try to stay like the one on the right of the frame no matter how old you are. Have a life to look back on and be proud of. Because you can't choose the one in the left frame. But the one on the right is entirely your choice. Gaspar Noe also said bluntly, I choose the right side.",1
492,"Its one of those movies that you know is ""a well done film"" and it is. But i didn't like it. Its worth a watch but the 2 1/2 hrs go by very slowly. Although its a beautifully film, its just too slow for me.",1
493,"While the split-screen gimmick was more warranted than in Lux Æterna, and the technical prowess it took to execute was top tier, the story, even with all its great themes, simply lags too often to be a must-see, especially for attention-starved general audiences.",0
494,"So I saw this at the NYC public premiere, where Gaspar Noe attended and gave a Q&A at the end! He introduced the film by saying, ""I hope you cry.""! I didn't cry, but I did feel deep despair! He also hung out in the lobby before and after! I got a picture with him before the film and got him to sign the book that came with my special edition of ""Irreversible: The Straight Cut"" afterward and asked him if he'd ever consider making a Giallo film, now that he's made a film with Giallo legend, Dario Argento. He said no, because it would be sexist nowadays. Unless the killer was a gay dude! 🤣 His paraphrased words, not mine! But seriously, I'd LOVE to see Gaspar do a Giallo film! Gay or straight!

There's no denying Gaspar's brilliance! He is an artist among artists! Just when some people wrote him off as a shock director, he goes and makes a tender and heart-wrenching movie like this! The technique once again is impeccable. This is Filmmaking: 101 and Professor Noe is in the building! Literally ""in the building"", at the IFC Center in NYC today and tomorrow! It was a very quite movie and slow moving, but seriously I could watch those two wander around their apartment all day! The split screen was not just a gimmick. It served a narrative purpose and was used very creatively and effectively, and there were some really good performances from everyone, which was almost entirely improv! I loved seeing Argento! ""Dad's Italian and shouts."" That line hit close to home! Why are we Italians so loud!? 🤣🇮🇹🙋🏻‍♂️ 

I liked the ""Climax"" reference in this! Gaspar should do a spin-off of ""Climax"" with Psyche as the main character! I loved hearing the song ""Gracias A La Vida"" in this! I love the new version by Kacey Musgraves! And the opening music sequence was sublime! Knowing the story behind it from the Q&A with Gaspar afterward, made it even more poignant, since the singer is currently battling throat cancer. In the Q&A he also said that in addition to Haneke's ""Amour"" being a big influence on this, ""Tokyo Story"" was also an inspiration for this! I'm so glad I just saw that movie recently, so I totally got it! Also in the Q&A, he made the following comment and while I do believe in life after death in some form (not a cloudy space), he said ""I don't believe in life after death. I don't even believe in life before death."" I kinda totally feel that last half! Epic quote! I can now check seeing Gaspar Noe on the big screen and meeting him off the bucket list! Now I just need to check off seeing a rerelease of ""Enter the Void"" on the big screen! 

While this is brilliant filmmaking, I wish it were a little more Noe-ish and/or more controversial and earth-shattering, coming from Noe, but I guess it's controversial that he didn't make it controversial! He showed his softer side, which meeting him in person seems true to him. He was very nice and pretty soft spoken, which some might not expect. I need to watch again to solidify my rating, but ""Vortex"" may be his most balanced and refined film, even if it wasn't my favorite by him. I was totally engrossed, even at the most mundane of moments, but their were two idiots sitting in front of me, laughing at sad parts and rapping over the beeping of a heart monitor in a scene. That took me out of it a bit, but I can't wait to rewatch on my couch and maybe I'll even round it up to the 4 1/2 stars it may rightly deserve, especially given the epic experience I had going to see it! While this may be a 4 out of 5 (for now), a 4 for a Gaspar film, is relative and he's only being scored against himself, since very few are on his level! A Gaspar 4 is like an everyone else's 8 and the max rating is only 5, so he's out of everyone's league!",1

502,I loved the movie. It touch my heart in way I didn't know it could.,1
503,"Went into this knowing absolutely nothing about the plot, I did not expect to be emotionally destroyed on a Thursday afternoon. Let's get the most obvious thing out of the way, Jenna Ortega is incredible and is one of the best young actresses working today. This is by far my favorite performance I've seen from her so far. She is just so good. The rest of the cast is so good as well. The cinematography, dialogue, characters, humor, and emotion are just so good. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that I think is a must-watch for people.",1
504,"Wow never felt like this after a movie, how she describes her feeling of being empty inside is dead on.",1
505,"Above the skies of Brazil, seemingly innocuous pink clouds signal the beginning of a looming terror and an issue that lingers for years. Can humans adapt and survive without the socialisation, fresh air, and ""normality"" we've come accustomed to? And no, I'm not talking about COVID-19. The Pink Cloud predates the pandemic by about three years.

The opening titles state: ""This film was written in 2017 and shot in 2019. Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental."" A timely coincidence indeed, the story is eerily similar to the real world, and the surrealist event at its centre seems somewhat plausible in the post-COVID world. Written and directed by Iuli Gerbase as her feature film debut -  a strong debut at that - the sudden appearance of pink clouds across the globe causes nationwide lockdowns as people become stuck  in their immediate surroundings. The imagery of the clouds is stunning, framing them through proscenium-shaped windows as the confused residents glare at the phenomenon. In the opening images, we see a woman walking her dog by a beach that is silently killed by  mist, introducing us to the fear-ridden world to come. The pink clouds act indiscriminately, attack predatorily, kill in just ten seconds after contact, and are a scientific mystery.

The film centres around Giovana (Renata se Lélis) and Yago (Eduardo Mendoça), who engage in a one-night stand the night before the clouds appear. They wake up entangled in a hammock on the patio, blissfully unaware that these will be their last moments before a gruelling lockdown. Yago opens his phone and shows Giovana what can be  presumed to be an article about the clouds, to which she replies, ""it must be a joke."" Moments later, they lock themselves inside. Soon after the lockdown, people begin to run out of food, and many domestic and political disputes start. The solution to the lack of resources is a tube installed in their home to deliver food and packages. As they open the hatch, they watch the clock, waiting to see if they will drop without warning and become victims to the pink mist. The couple defines their relationship and celebrates birthdays as the days, weeks, months, and years pass by. 

Throughout the film, the familiar feelings of isolation plague the characters. The situation for each of them manifests itself in different ways. Yago leans into the rose-coloured environment while Giovana does everything she can to escape the pink tinge of her life. At one point, Yago asks Giovana, ""Why do you suffer for things you can't change?"". Giovana is incapable of being content with the state of the world, while Yago fully embraces the world's limitations, at times to his detriment. While Giovana is open about her discomfort, Yago seems to bottle his emotions to layer them with optimism. Are these characters' relationships being held together by the pink clouds, and if the clouds should disappear, will they be ripped apart?

In a Sundance Institute interview with the director, Iuli Gerbase said, ""my idea when I wrote the film was to explore what happiness and freedom mean to each one of us."" Her exploration of the human psyche dealing with loneliness and isolation is poignant and overwhelmingly relevant in 2022. Overall, The Pink Cloud enters an area of storytelling that, in light of the pandemic, could be dangerous territory. However, the film offers an interesting perspective on the intricacies of family, loss, and freedom that transcends it from being a cliché disaster flick into a relevant familial commentary.",1
506,I think that this was written by a child; one struggling with coherent thought. Boring to boot.,0
507,"The Pink Cloud is a Brazilian family drama about a couple that just met that has to go into quarantine seemingly forever because of a pink cloud.  This was filmed before Covid, however there are some pretty eerie similarities.  There a few things that don't make any sense, including how this poison air that prevents people from going outside doesn't seep into the houses that people reside.  It's not a tight film, but time skips for no reason which makes the pacing inconsistent and awkward.  The entire film is vague, but I haven't seen a movie in a long time that has such a self-important feel. The entirety does not amount to much and falls flat into the dustbin of cloudy unfocused features.  Final Score: 3/10",0
508,"Written in 2017 and filmed in 2019, filmmaker Iuli Gerbase's debut feature embodies a remarkable prescience about the events that came to dominate global culture over the next two years. This story about the unexpected appearance of pink clouds that contain toxic gases and kill quickly after exposure follows the experiences of a young couple who just met but are hurriedly forced indoors into joint isolation to stay alive. Their years-long time together leads to an on-again/off-again relationship while they each attempt to deal with issues related to survival, depression, a lack of interpersonal connection and all of the other matters that have ironically become all too familiar to many of us in recent years. But, beyond the uncanny parallels to real life, this Brazilian offering also explores a host of other philosophical and moral issues, such as acceptance of our circumstances, knowing when to let go and developing appreciation for what we have, even in the absence of what we've lost. Admittedly, the film suffers from occasional pacing issues (especially in the second half), as well as repetitiveness in some aspects of the screenplay/narrative. Nevertheless, this release has much to say, not only about what we've experienced, but also in terms of what we should consider taking away from it.",1
509,"Maybe if this was released pre-COVID times it would be more shocking, but most of the movie is a slow and subtle descent into the type of monotony most of us have experienced during the lock down phases of the pandemic. 

I expected a bit more of an apocalyptic  / sci-fi feel, but it is more of a family drama.",0

It was almost a private screening as only two (separately) of us in the cinema, but unlike so many films which rely on ‘crowd reaction' this engulfs you without need for anyone else's responses.

520,"The unnecessarily-grotesque amount of gratuitous violence and grim & grisly story-line only proves that the narrowly-minded writer and director were making this film for their own consumption and that of other sick, twisted viewers like themselves.

524,Revenge Thriller ‘Bull' Surprises With Visceral Violence and Horror Leanings,1
525,"Although it's grittier and more violent than many other films in the genre, the central premise is nevertheless a pretty standard revenge thriller set in London and involving gangsters. The relentlessness of the main character, the mystery surrounding him, and the cast (both Maskell and Hayman deliver menacing performances) are what keep things afloat, but they're not quite enough to carry ‘Bull' into ‘great' territory. Still, watching the one-man army on a persistent pursuit of revenge, putting his targets through hell, is never boring to watch and it does choose to go out in an interesting way, even if I don't think it's as effective as it's supposed to be.",0

528,"Everything Went Fine (2021) is a French film directed by François Ozon. The movie tells the story of André, an 85-year-old man who has a stroke and is half-paralysed in his hospital bed. His daughter Emmanuelle hurries to his bedside, and André asks her to help him end his life. Emmanuelle is torn, as she does not want to lose her father but also does not want him to suffer.

The plot unfolds in a series of conversations between Emmanuelle and André, as well as flashbacks to André's life. The film is a moving exploration of the relationship between a father and daughter, and the difficult choices that must be made when faced with death. The acting by the two leads is excellent, and the film is beautifully shot.

Everything Went Fine is a compassionate and honest film about the end of life, and the difficult choices that must be made. It is an intelligent and thought-provoking movie that will stay with you long after you have seen it.",1

How it changes the girl who hatches it is very frightening.  The mother is just as terrifying.  It is an interesting study how parents project their own failed ambitions onto their children.

An effective thriller more than anything else, 'Kimi' is super tight and maintains action.  It also comments on the current state of the FBI in a very interesting, and subtle way.

580,"Cerdita tells the story of Sara, an overweight teenager, excluded by the circle of other young girls, so she spends all her time at her father's butcher shop, afraid of what could be the next humiliation she will suffer from the group of girls. slender.
Cerdita is a horror film, screened at Sundance's Midnight 2022 show in the Alternative and Different Films section, not to mention weird. The film echoes a bit like Carrie and a setting similar to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, yes, we have a small town, small sets in a residence dominated by the infernal heat and meats around. And I mention Carrie, of course, for the practice of bullying that is shown in the film. If in the film Sorria, we have mental health as an element of horror, in Cerdita, we have the search for acceptance and loneliness itself.
This is certainly a film that does not seek to offer us comfort, from start to finish it is uncomfortable, both for its protagonist and for the viewer. Violence appears in different ways, whether in the dialogues, in some detail in the corner of the screen and even in the moments when Sara (Laura Galán) wants to disappear and we see that it is something impossible to happen, in Cerdita violence is presented to us in a different way. growing.
Pereda, shows us a provocative, reflective film that mixes at the same time a bit of gore and the drama of real everyday problems. Cerdita, in a few years' time will surely be touted as a horror film in which the yearning and dread of bullying solidifies into a bloody catharsis.",1

591,"God's Creatures, the latest release from prestige distribution company A24, is an impactful drama focused on an Irish seaside town torn apart by a lie told by Aileen O'Hara as she attempts to protect her son Brian from an allegation of sexual assault. In such a small and interconnected town, Aileen's kneejerk decision to cover for her son causes citizens to choose sides as the accuser is simultaneously supported and ostracized by those who knew her best.

Directed by Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer, God's Creatures strength is also its weakness. The decision to keep the focus of the story tight on Aileeen and her crumbling relationship with Brian makes for outstanding character work and opportunities for Emily Watson to showcase her talents, but it also hinders the overall impact that Alieen's decision has on the town. Outside of a pair of scenes set early in the third act, the opportunity to break the story wide open and fully examine the ripple effects one lie can have on a community fall by the wayside.

God's Creatures stars Emily Watson as Aileen O'Hara, the mother of the accused and the central focus point of the story. The film is Watson's to carry, and the actress performs admirably, revealing that as much as the movie is a story about what happens with the town's population, it's just as much a tale of the slow dismantling of a mother's faith in her son. Watson delivers the peaks and valleys of the joy of Aileen reconnecting with her son she hasn't seen in years as well as the dismay at what that son has become. By film's end, Watson's full-blown transformation is a sight to behold.

Also starring Paul Mescal as Brian O'Hara, the film's inciting character, Mescal is great at playing the sort of sleazebag that never fully realizes the pain he's caused or the detriment he's brought upon the community. It's shown at the top of the film that Brian is returning to the town after some years away in Australia and while the question is raised more than once about what finally brought him back, Mescal is incredibly effective at dodging the question while also conveying that it's likely Brian is fleeing the law or got caught up with the wrong crowd. Where Mescal shines the most is portraying Brian as a character content to float through life, depending on the charity of others, especially his mother, to get by.

With less screen time than the others, Aisling Franciosi plays Sarah Murphy, the most affected character in the film. While she's one of the story's lynchpins, it's odd that Sarah disappears for swaths of time during the movie's second and third act as the focus shifts to Aileen and her coming to grips with what she's done. For the relatively small amount of time she's on screen, Franciosi is wonderful as the inward-drawn Sarah, deeply affected by the film's events. Her relegation to an almost third tier character is saved by a powerful third act monologue that Franciosi nails concerning the town, her place in it, and the necessity for a fresh start in life.

Directed by Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer, the duo managed to tell an intriguing tale in a short amount of time. There's an efficiency to the filmmaking; no scene is wasted, and everything serves its purpose. Taking the first act to set up the closeness of these characters, the dynamics between them, and the dubious nature of Brian's past sets the stage for the small scale stakes of the dismantling of the town's camaraderie and the larger stakes of Aileen's crumbling relationship with Brian.

Overall, God's Creatures is a tough look at the lack of accountability in men's predatory actions while also attempting to examine the fallout that results afterwards. Directors Davis and Hunter do an excellent job tackling the former while coming up short on the latter. Anchored by an award worthy performance by Emily Watson and further bolstered by a laissez-faire delivery from Paul Mescal, it's the acting that carries the movie over the finish line. An excellent idea for a story that could've been mined further for both emotional impact and overall implications for the small village, the 94 minute drama unfortunately left a few stones unturned.",0
592,"'God's Creatures' is a real film, an 'acting' film full of great performances.

SYNOPSIS: 'A mother tells a lie for her beloved son that rips apart their family and close-knit Irish town -- ultimately testing her own sense of right and wrong.'

If there's such a genre as a 'quiet thriller' then this film is it. In a film which looks stunning, however dark the rugged Irish landscape might be, this tells a story of a small community stuck in patriarchal ways from a long gone past.

Emily Watson in particular excels and gives an emotionally stirring performance as a conflicted mother who in the end pays back in the most harrowing way.

Possible Oscar contender? Maybe.

593,A master Class in good foreshadowing.,1
594,"This isn't leprechauns and Blarney stones. This is a grey, overcast Ireland where people constantly smoke and drink whiskey to take the edge off their lives and the whole village smells like the fish factory. A bleak, plodding movie that has great performances, not for the faint of heart or those wanting a fairytale ending.",1
595,"Tight movie. Great acting and story. Tension on the tens!! Only challenge was some audio clarity. Partly attributed to accents, maybe the theater, but I think some recording imperfections too.",1
596,"God's Creatures invites you to Aileen's deep questioning inside her. She knows the truth but can't accept it because of the family bond. Day by day, she starts drowning in her mind, and we are witnessing this suffocating process.",1
597,The acting was very good and the sound and cinematography helped create an atmosphere of mystery and emotion. Very well done by the directors.,1
598,"GREAT acting by Watson. Dark, atmospheric, and moody. But, the ending, lack of resolution, and lack of actual information for the audience, was extremely frustrating. Clearly, that frustration was intended so that the audience ""feels"" like what Aileen feels and many others involved. But I don't think this approach works for the audience. I needed and wanted more definitive information about the two major events in the story line.",0
599,Kali is a powerhouse.Should have earned an Academy Award nomination.She is that good.,1
600,"Kali Reis is a star in a film that one day we will look back on as the beginning of a wonderful career in the acting profession.  This picture is about human trafficking and how it is happening in plain sight.  The dramatic feature, written and directed by Josef Kubota Wladyka, is tense and taught. The final scene may take you out of the movie, but stick with it and it will all make sense.  There was one character that took me out of the film.  If you watched Ozark and know of Darlene Snell, you'll understand that Lisa Emory is basically playing the same person and there is one scene in particular that is eerily reminiscent to a scene in Ozark.  A horrible casting choice.  This one will be in the wheelhouse of watchers of Ozark, and that will be all those people will be thinking about.  That being said, it is a really good film and the spotlight should shine bright in trying to stop the crime that was mentioned above.  This film is as good as I've seen in doing that!  Final Score: 7.7/10",1
601,"Sucked, waste of time",0
602,"Avoids the cliches of its genre and has fabulous roles played by actress-debuting professional boxers Kali Reis & Shelly Vincent - THEY ARE GREAT!

All put together - this is far from masterpiece but very worthy of seeing.",1
603,It was horrible. She dies in the end getting shot..... doesn't even get to question the guy behind it all and we have no idea whether the sister is alive or dead. Pointless movie.,0
604,"O filme é sombrio demais, apressado na construção dos personagens, e um tanto quanto inverossímil. Só inicia após 30 minutos.",0
605,"An impressive movie by director/writer Wladyka in just his second full-length picture, and by Kali Reis in her first. 
Reise gives a strong, authentic performance here as a Kaylee, a woman suffering from great loss, both in her family and her professional career.  Once a champion in the ring with a loving sister and mother, she's now a shell of her former very powerful self, living with guilt of her lost sister and a mother who still blames Kaylee for that loss.

607,Great acting. Ending is disappointing and lacking.,0
608,A compelling story and incredible performance from Kali Reis.,1
609,"Great performances, beautiful cinematography but the story is meandering and really slow.",0
610,"This is very much a brooding, mysterious and spooky somewhat sinister seeming film. The fact its shot in black and white helps add to the overall atmosphere. It is fairly gripping at points, though a little slow to get going. It has quite a play type feel to it, so don't be expecting fast action and visual effects - its more character based, exploring themes of guilt and regret and it has a good use of spooky/chilling music in the background. This film is a good one for fans of mystery and chilling ghost type stories, not so much for all out horror fans, I'd say. It surprised me by becoming quite impactful at the end, so I upped my rating for this film.",1
611,"It takes a great deal of talent to blend the genre's vibe with such subtle and profound theological scrutiny, but Mark O'brien, for all his extensive involvement, delivers bigtime on all levels.",1
612,"The acting, especially Czerny, is incredible. The end is a monster. The whole thing is not super clear, but the enigma is there for a reason. Great film.",1
613,An incredible debut feature from Mark O'Brien. Amazing performances from all three leads and some brilliant writing from O'Brien as well. Cannot wait to see what comes next from O'Brien.,1
614,This is literature.  This is art.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie.  The wages of sin...,1
615,"This first feature from director-actor-writer Mark O'Brien (Ready or Not) is about Frederic (Henry Czerny) a grieving man already struggling with his faith who decides to help an injured Aaron Smith (O'Brien) when the man knocks on his door and claims to be lost in the woods.

Frederic and his wife Ethel (Mimi Kuzyk) invite the man to stay, but Frederic soon begins to doubt why the man is there and the stories he tells. In fact, he could be there to test everything that Frederic -- a one-time priest before he got married -- knows. He's already endured the tragic loss of his daughter. What can be next?

Filmed in striking black and white by cinematographer Scott McClellan, this movie is either a man of lapsed faith against the very human past sins made flesh or a home invasion movie. It could be both. As Aaron starts putting his feet up on the table, reading the brochure on the dead child's funeral expenses, asking some very personal questions and perhaps getting too close to Ethel, this film proves itself to be a long simmering and suspenseful effort that isn't afraid to its it's time, nor worried about a small cast. After all, there's so much talent here.",0
616,"A great psychological thriller, in a dark and understated way. I loved the cinematography and the ambiguous ending.  As a Protestant, I don't fully comprehend  Catholic conceptions of guilt and contrition; I think I might have liked this movie even more if I did, since that was key to the moral tension at the centre of the film.  Also, it would help to know if  what the main character was feeling in the film had any basis in theology or just his own pain and grief.  Not a traditional horror film, but still horror IMO.",1
617,A Slow-Burn Religious Thriller That'll Creep Under Your Skin,1
618,"I found this movie entertaining , it has that old 1980's feel to it , the actresses are engaging, and there is a certain comedic value,  and just enough action to make it a family film enjoyable?",1
619,"If I see one more review comparing this movie to The Thing I'm going to swallow a squid and peel my face off.

Director Nyla Innuksuk film debut Slash/Back tells a loose story of an alien invasion in a small Inuit village. A group of girls must band together to defend themselves from an alien attack. They steal one their parents' boats and go off to an island, where they are attacked by a rabid ""polar bear"". The situation escalates quickly and people start behaving as strangely as the polar bear.

Long story short, chaos ensues and the young girls are on the defense (and the offense at times) of a small alien invasion.

The movie is posed as a horror comedy, but many of the punchlines fall short. It may have had better success if it leaned further into horror than comedy and capitalized on it's practical effects.

Does it have it's moments? Yes. If you go into this expecting spectacular acting, special effects, and a well-rounded ending...you're going to be disappointed. These aren't the Stranger Things kids as much as you want them to be. Just enjoy the way the aliens make their victims look like skin suits and move like braindead zombies.

The importance of this movie lies in the representation of the Inuit culture. This is a widely unrepresented indigenous culture. I felt myself researching the mythological Ijiraq shape-shifter that was mentioned. Innuksuk should be proud of this...and then make a better movie.

Rating: Story and ending: 5/10 Special effects: 4/10 Practical effects: 6/10 Laughs: 1/10 Chemistry of the cast 6/10 Alien skin suits: 8/10 Polar bear alien: 8/10 Bonus points for culture: 10/10 Overall: 4.5/10.",0
620,So I'm supportive of any authentic movie production by and with indigenous  people not connected to the corporate movie production industry and represention of peoples playing the actual age of the characters in the movie not some 20 year actress as Hollywood loves to do no offense. and i Hope to see these actress in other movies And films because I think they were the best part of the movie. Given their basic budget and I think this was a d level this was some next level impressive film making. Truly respect.,1
621,"It's got great heart and a thoroughly likeable cast. Even though the acting is ... well, I still want to see more of all these kids.",1
622,"The story was decent enough. But the acting and special effects or lack there of, was so bad that I almost stopped watching it. Luckily I watched while at home bored and sick with Covid. So I had some time to kill.",0
623,Awesome story with great character development. This felt a lot more genuine in terms of how real people might react to such circumstances than many other horror films. Definitely worth a watch!,1
624,Horrible. An after school feature with a ton of gore. ,0
625,"could have been good, but they decided to hire way too many unexperienced child actors. i can respect that it's a film about community and that they may have used people from the neighborhood, but they are extremely bad at acting and i can't stomach watching the film because of it. this would have been fully watchable if the kids were a good decade older, but it just feels weird, like the tone of the movie is for young adults who want a little more edgy content, but the actual cast members should be at home watching dora the explorer.

they even start the movie with a scene of a father teaching her daughter to hunt, and then fast forward 6 years. they could *easily* have just skipped a little further, but as it is i just can't figure out what kind of audience the movie is intended for. it's too gory for kids the age of the cast to be watching it, and older kids aren't going to be interested in watching because they won't identify with the little kids. adults won't like it either, because the delivery is so bad that it's genuinely made me uncomfortable. 

overall, i'm really into the premise and the concept of the film, but whatever good there is in this movie is completely ruined by line after line of little kids who barely know how to act and may not even be old enough to know what the words they are reading mean. you simply can't make a movie with so many adult themes and depictions of graphic violence using a cast like this.",0
626,"Terrific take on The Thing, this time up in Nunavut Territory, Canada. With all the adults away at a Summer Solstice dance, three tween girls are left to battle the aliens. It's really well done plus you get a view of life in Pang, the small town where it was filmed. As another bonus, the characters speak in Inuit and the section titles are written in that cool Canadian syllabary writing, then transforms into English. Lots of fun, a little gore, and a bit of an anthropological excursion. 

Note: most of the critics say something about this being a tribute to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and forget that it was a remake of Howard Hawks' ""The Thing from another World"" (1951) which still holds up.",1
627,Great fun! Highly recommend.,1
628,"Maybe it is because the situation hits a little too close home, but this story will stick by me for years and now, months after watching I still think about it daily … The small-talk, the looks, the subtle way of showing the love and grieve, you feel it in your bones. I don't think I am the same person after this movie.",1
629,"Outstanding film. Both young actors are incredible, this story is definitely a tear-jerker and a must-see. Lukas Dhont, thank you very much - I recently went through something similar with a friend and this was a fantastic medium to understand myself and my relationships.",1
630,One of the best films from this year. Truly gut-wrenching.,1
631,"absolutely Phenomenon movie, deserves all the awards.",1
632,"Tough to watch, because the pain of the two 13-year-old boys who are the center of the story is convincingly portrayed, and the intensity of their acting is remarkable. A Q&A with the director followed the screening I saw (at the Walter Reade Theatre in NYC), and his thoughtful and articulate comments were quite illuminating.",1
633,Such an amazing movie. Really hoping for it to be in this year´s Oscars,1
634,"Beautiful, painful, leaves you so full yet so empty. A joy to have experienced.",1
635,"This movie did an outstanding job. I have experienced, in a very similar way like Remi, what it’s like to have a friendship end because of the judgment of others speaking into it. The deep, platonic, and intimate friendship came under attack. Like Remi, I lost not only a good friend but a brother. I highly recommend this movie, and for people to see it. Let’s normalize platonic touch within deep brotherly friendships again!",1
636,Heartbreakingly good!!  Best International film of the year,1
637,les yeux vont pleurer!,1
638,This movie has all the elements of a good film. It gave me an adrenaline ride throughout the movie. Adding comedy to a drama gives the movie balance. EMERGENCY is atop of my list for 2022.,1
639,"Funny, powerful and terrifying all thrown together into one. Both RJ Cyler and Donald Elise Watkins were incredible in this. Their chemistry is on another level and just worked so well. I am just still coming down from the fact I laughed my ass off, my blood pressure rose to unsafe levels and cried my eyes out all in the same movie.",1
640,It's the last 30 seconds that got to me the most. A best friend sadly watches his friend's reaction of terror to the sounds of a siren. That is a powerful ending. Kudos for the delicate touch. Can't wait to watch it a 3rd time.,1
641,"'Emergency' had a chance to make a big statement after a rather large build, but couldn't stick the landing.  After establishing a premise that was so real and building a world that was authentic and believable, Carey Williams missed the mark with the finish that couldn't dent the reality based world.  Then you're thrust back into the reality in the final scene.  That yo yo was the only real negative.  The journey is better that the destination thanks in large part to the chemistry of the two leads of the film, RJ Cyler and Donald Elise Watkins. There are some particularly funny moments that often come out of left field.  The social commentary is generally accurate and fairly in your face.  The tonal shifts generally work, and the trauma relayed to the viewer is real and effective.  Final Score: 6.5/10",1

645,I got bored in most scenes. I finished it in 3 days. 😆,0
646,"i don't know how this can be so well rated. it's not awful, but it's just an endless and tedious string of shallow arguments and irrational decision making. it seems that the writers don't care at all for the quality of the dialogue, and think they can fool the audience into thinking its a deep or nuanced story just by having characters constantly act like bickering jerks. i am half way through and i simply stopped, because the plot is going nowhere. this might seem appealing to a younger audience who really wants to go to college parties, but it's just lukewarm nonsense. they also seem to say the n word about every 5 seconds on average, which seems like a cheap way to leverage the ""black voices"" category for more views.",0

This movie was engaging from start to finish and every second of it was perfect, I’m not gonna say anything that happened but man I really enjoyed this movie and cannot wait for the sequel to “X” titled “MaXXXine”, definitely watch this film I personally would give it a 10/10, that’s how much I liked it!",1

At first thought it was a fairly typical wonder years coming of age in the 60s suburbia story but the fantastical aspect to it took it to another level and just loved the deadpan humor throughout it.

682,"I'd give it a higher score if it would have tried harder. There was minimal plot, and it was far too repetitive. I'm also too old to be really unnerved by creepypastas. I was out of college when it became a thing, I think? So this meant precious little to me, beyond the main character's devolution. Our MC was well-acted, honestly. But she needed to be given much more to do. The script was unfortunately lazy. And the end? No. I don't want to see a man pushing 50 romanticizing his probably delusional in-person meeting with a young girl in a way that smacks of bad theater monologue.",0

690,"Visually spectacular, impressive and so so good looking, but really.. it was gratuitously grotesque, made such little sense and had poor sound engineering so some scenes were almost too quiet and others were so sharply loud that i had to block my ears at the cinema. I could genuinely feel the mood in the theater, people were just waiting for the film to end so they could leave. I don't know what to say, I loved it and hated it so much I never want to see it again.

The film is comprised of 3 parts, I recommend just watching the first. I think someone really could edit this into an outstandinly good film, but as it stands this aint it",0
691,The first 20 minutes is great as there is a kind of story going on but then after that it just turns into some sort of mish mash of stop animation projects just chucked together randomly.,0
692,"this movie is a piece of art incomparable in form and substance to just about anything else. This can be either a good thing or a bad thing, depending. The opening 30 minutes are, in my opinion, some of the best filmmaking I have ever seen, though it does get a little bit too confusing for it's own good afterwards, though it remains enthralling nonetheless",1
693,Best horror film of the year.,1
694,Horrifying decent into a wasteland of stop-motion animated bodily fluids & nightmarish oddities. Insane amount of world building with no dialogue & plenty of famous stop-motion characters from the history of cinema just lingering.,1
695,"this move fundamentally changed me somehow and i'm not sure how to cope with it lol.
not only is it a visual masterpiece, the storytelling and world-building absolutely astounded me. when i watched Mad God i felt the themes and ideas so intimately i had to step back several times. how i see it, to truly understand the story, you have to look behind the main character and think, ""how did we get here?""
in my opinion, if you need dialogue or a coherent ""plot"" with the MC to understand the movie, you aren't understanding it. the assassin is like the stick of celery i use to shovel ranch dressing into my mouth at a party. yeah, i take a bite of celery every time, but i'm doing it to taste the ranch.
i love this movie to pieces, and i could spend days pouring over every detail and shoving it into my body right next to the gallon of ranch. i could ramble on for probably forever, but if you're wondering whether to watch it or not: absolutely do. just maybe not when you're eating.",1
696,"The credit that I do give this has much more to do with the visual creativity.  It is otherwise bleak throughout, seemingly without much purpose in the story.  It's a gore-fest.  I was hoping for more of a story.  The filmmaker is exceptional at his craft visually though.  It might be accurate to call it a visual masterpiece, but I am not too certain about there being any sort of quality storytelling though.",1

702,If you don't love this movie then you ain't no good as movie watching. This is like 100 times better than any lame major studio film.,1
703,"Well, this came out of nowhere.  A quirky comedy from the mind of Adam Carter Rehmeier.  This gets everyday suburban American life thanks in large part to the casting.  An unlikely love story with a fantastic chemistry in every scene.  The two leads, Kyle Gallner and Emily Skeggs shouldn't work, but it somehow does.  I found myself captivated and wondering where it was going next.  At times it gave me a certain Thelma & Louise feel, but even the conclusion is logical.  Hard to believe it took nearly four years of sitting on the shelf for this to get a run in theaters.  Final Score: 8.7/10",1
704,"I wish I could do anything in my life as well as Emily and Kyle own these two characters. So much of the movie is made of single shots - close ups of the actors from their shoulders up. The shape of the lips, the blink of the eyes, the small sounds and small smiles, the tears - these are the marks of actors who have become Patty and Simon. Because, when you're face to face, there's nowhere to hide.

The start is slow and boring - just like so much of America. And then it builds. And builds, and catches aflame. By the end I desperately wanted these characters to be happy.

Don't like the language? You're one of the parents that Simon is railing against, you're unhappy with a little too much cumin, and you don't remember life 40 years ago, or didn't really live it. The talk is raw, but it's real, and, for some of us, it's truth. Emily is on a Hero's Journey - try and keep up.

705,"This one didn't quite do it for me. There's a fair amount of funny scenes but they all included ancillary or side characters while almost every scene with exclusively the 2 leads fell flat. Neither of them are all that endearing or interesting, and this being a coming of age rom com...it kind of needed better character doing the coming of age rom com-ing.",0
706,Cute indie movie. Dark humor with heart,1
707,"This movie was such a surprise. For some reason I had never heard of it. Started watching it, and in the beginning I wasn't sure about. Didn't think I liked it. But pushed through. Then as soon as the leads were together on screen, it all fell into place for me. And it just exploded into a movie that I LOVED. And now I am OBSESSED WITH IT. Can't believe that there was ever a single second I was unsure of. I Absolutely Love it.",1
708,"Tons of potential. Well filmed. Well scored. Well acted. But the story just never leaves you satisfied. It ends just as it began. And ultimately, you have learned nothing from the experience.",0
709,"Adolescence is a time for finding oneself, especially when it comes to our sense of personal power. That's rarely easy, but it can be especially difficult for a teenage girl trapped in a household with a chauvinistic father, a condition not uncommon in many traditional Eastern European households. Such is the fate of a quiet but independently minded Croatian adolescent who longs for freedom from under the thumb of her domineering dad and capitulating mother. But the potential for profound change arises when a wealthy old friend of her father pays a visit to their coastal fishing village, one that could transform her life and that of her mother, provided they have the courage to act on it. Director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović's debut feature from Executive Producer Martin Scorsese presents an intense, intimate character study of an individual's search for empowerment in the face of oppressing odds and confusing circumstances that, like the clandestine behavior of the moray eels she and her father routinely hunt, deceptively conceal much of what's actually going on. This winner of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival Golden Camera Award for best first feature simmers slowly but builds tension well, engaging viewers handily, despite some repetitive narrative elements and occasional ""atmospheric"" camera work whose deliberate murkiness goes a little overboard in metaphorically depicting the intended character of the story. A number of films with themes similar to those explored here have emerged from this region in recent years, such as ""Hive"" (2021) and ""God Exists, Her Name is Petrunya"" (2019). That's an indication that there's a need for the expression of these notions, and, thankfully, filmmakers have successfully risen to the occasion, making the world more aware about conditions for women desperately in need of reform.",1
710,"Gripping and raw, this is a story of a family dynamic that is claustrophobic, beautiful and complex. A think piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend.",1
711,"Not getting it, disjointed jumps all over the place, probably just me",0
712,"Not a good movie. At the beginning there is a mystery for the viewer, but we never find what it was. Did the filmmakers even know?",0
713,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but was let down.
Feels like a project 4 friends threw together.
I like the 2 main actors, and would watch them do more acting, but overall, the ending especially, left me wanting for more.",0
714,"Something in the Dirt is a new model Under the Silver Lake. Los Angeles again, strange unsolved events, deaths, and strange characters. I recommend this peculiar movie to anyone who wants to watch a mind-blowing film.",1
715,"This film will likely polarize the audience based on their expectations before and during the viewing of the film, and the extent to which they accept the lack of definitive answers to what is happening. If you focus on the psychological aspects - the dynamics between the protagonists, the ""human too human"" attempt to make sense of the unexplainable, and the search for a purpose in life, - you may be satisfied. If you focus on the sci-fi aspects and expect the film to develop them you may be disappointed. I felt like the first focus was overused (although that may have been the film's main purpose). I also felt that the second axis was so exciting, built up gradually through a rather original setting, a specific use of camera and images, and the mix between science, alternative parascientist theories and today's access to all kinds of information, that deception was almost inevitable for the audience who expected more from these developments. Also, your attention can be grabbed - like the characters - to find what makes sense in all this interesting mess, to the point of feeling frustrated at the end.",0
716,"I keep waiting for these directors to make another 'Spring' but have come to the conclusion it's unlikely to happen. This is the latest and worst of the recent bunch - kind of like a no-budget 'Under The Silver Lake' only nowhere near as interesting. Meandering, overlong, unfocused, and flat, uninvolving characters make it one to avoid.",0
717,The greatest indie acting/directing duo there ever was. Masters of artistic science fiction storytelling. Atmospheric and entertaining at its core.,1
718,"When a pair of Los Angeles friends/neighbors (actors/directors Aaron Moorehead and Justin Benson) begin investigating a series of bizarre paranormal events in their apartment building, they believe they're onto unlocking a grand, unified theory of everything, one that's potentially dangerous but eminently enlightening (and really cool). But, with each ""revelation"" they come upon, they sink deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole of confusion and chaos that fails to provide them with clear answers and begins to affect their relationship. The result is an aimlessly protracted stream of consciousness exercise that extends into so many areas of allegedly profound exploration and supposed metaphysical significance that the overall narrative comes across like a combination of intellectual masturbation and navel contemplation writ large, punctuated by pointedly polite insults thrown toward one another about how each of them is wasting his life (talk about irony). While this Independent Spirit Award nominee for the John Cassavettes Award has its share of clever editing, inventive cinematography and moments of genuinely inspired humor, much of the film plays like a collection of half-baked ideas, inside jokes and failed attempts at lamely connecting profound insights that arose between its collaborators over an evening of bong hits. Whatever movie industry clout, filmmaking credibility and cinematic goodwill the directors may have amassed in their previous effort, ""The Endless"" (2017), they've squandered it here with this meandering, unfocused workshop on how not to make a movie. But, then, that's probably best evidenced in one of the picture's closing credits, which says that the film is dedicated to friends making movies together – and, based on the results of this offering, it's readily apparent what that gets you.",0
719,"I Love this movie! It's starts a bit campy but get interesting very quickly. It also goes meta which I really enjoyed. It's an intelligent, high concept film packed into a low budget format. The only weird thing about any of this is that the audience scored it a 46%. WTF? Maybe this is why Hollywood won't make too many smart films.  #WHATSINTHEDIRT",1
720,"Nowhere near as good as some of Justin Benson's other movies. Original approach, but too long, and beats the conceit to death. I was literally nodding. I had to wake myself up to finish it. Getting put to sleep is not a good sign of how entertaining something is. How cool it's supposed to be doesn't translate. It's not that cool. Not that funny either. It's eh.",0
721,What can I say? Me and the kids have been singing along for the last few days and just can't stop.,1
722,"Loved this musical - the songs, plot, acting, singing, dancing, and scenery!",1
723,"Well this was a nice little surprise! Not only a great retelling one of Roald Dahl's iconic stories, but a fantastic musical adaptation as well! Tim Minchin's song lyrics are quite clever and catchy,  and his music transposes from stage to film excellently, allowing for some great musical sequences with clever visuals that play with the lyrics! The sequences are staged and filmed so well and with so much energy, and the singing and dancing was so impressive, especially considering most of the cast is young children! These kids are so talented, I was blown away by the young cast, especially by Alisha Weir as Matilda, who really proves herself a gifted actress! She brings pathos to the role and shows she's no pushover no matter the consequences; she can really hold her own as an actress! I also really liked Emma Thompson as Trunchbull and she seems to be enjoying every evil second of it! Lashana Lynch was great too! One would have to possess a heart of stone to not experience some joy while watching this — it's a delight! I really enjoyed it… and it's going to be months before I get ""Revolting Children"" out of my head!",1
724,"I didn't think it was possible, but this stage musical translated extremely well to film. This movie impresses with some lovely visuals, a few chops and changes in the musical arrangement, a darker tone to the traditional story and some excellent performances from the adult and child actors alike.
This movie keeps the keystones included in the OG movie version whilst offering up something completely different. Judge it on its own merit and you'll be watching it time and time again.",1
725,Im seeing a lot of misguided low reviews because they they think this is a musical based off the 1996 movie. This musical is based on the west-end/Broadway musical that was based on the book. Fantastic musical! Super catchy songs. Amazing talent ,1

731,"If you can handle the annoying nature of the main character, it's a fun ride. that being said, this is meant to showcase the absolute most annoying of internet personalities so under that context, it's excusable.

735,Hilarious and at times genuinely creepy! Absolutely loved it!,1

737,"This got great reviews, but I found it deeply irritating.   Just a guy running around screaming like a girl for an hour and a half. I didn't realise it was a comedy, which has no place in horror films imo, or I never would have watched it.",0
738,I respect the creativity but this was dumb and pointless. I couldn't take the main actor but that isn't his fault. They clearly wrote him to be a very goofy guy but it wasn't for me. I just wasn't a fan of the comedy and other aspects of this. I could not finish it. This has pretty good reviews so maybe something spectacular happens at the end but I got the impression this wasn't worth the time to finish.,0

742,"This is a pretty decent film, about a teenager who realises the somewhat shady line of work her father is involved in. I did think the shaky camerawork was a little distracting, although it perhaps does give it a feel of realism - a bit of a documentary feel, or sense, to it perhaps. I thought the main character was well portrayed. It's sort of a film of two halves - there are scenes of her with her family, where things seem fine and scenes of her doggedly trying to find out what 'lies beneath' as it were. The nuisance, I felt, was at the end - I wasn't really sure quite where the main character stood - what the future held. I can't say its a bad film - its somewhat thoughtful and worth a watch overall I'd say but I was left feeling a little confused about what the ultimate outcome was.",1

If you like animated features that have great storytelling, this is one to see.",1
746,"Beautiful story, with brilliantly amazing audio visuals of story telling",1
747,"This movie was an absolute must-see. I came in completely blind, without seeing a single preview, and the animation and story absolutely blew me away. The movie is stunning, visceral, tragic, and builds all this hype during your viewing experience that is so hard to replicate. The movie took my breath away multiple times, each more intense than the last. When I thought I'd reached the peak of my emotional experience, it would blow me away again. Every character is compelling, even if you only see them on the screen for a brief moment in time. If it ever comes back to theaters, and if you want to see one of the most artistic anime films I've seen in the past decade, is one of the most emotionally and auditorily compelling, please go see this.",1

Not a great movie for someone new to anime, IMO. But, to each their own.",1
750,Great movie!!!! The animation was wonderful. The plot was very original. I would recommend this to anime fans and fans of animation in general.,1
751,Amazing and beautiful!,1
752,very unique and intriguing movie that lies between fiction and non-fiction historical events. First of all Avu-chan (queen bee) singing is amazing and if you havnt you must listen to her other songs as well as her featured in the movie!!,1
753,"This film has many oddly paced sequences but if you sit back and let the filmmakers vision just wash over you, you will have experienced one of the most uniquely drawn films and one of the best japanese cast iv heard in a very long time. I felt enthralled by the music and much more",1
754,This movie was EPIC! I was not expecting the amazing story. The animation was fresh and beautiful. I loved the music as well. Definitely recommend!,1
755,"Starts somewhere in the middle, likely with many viewers scratching their head to know what's happening and then the story somewhat is pieced together after 45min to an hour of slow burn boredom. We then understand the AU police is trying to coerce a confession. Poor screenplay and not enough juice in the story. Consequently, the movie feels more like a dry documentary that nobody wants to watch.",0
756,"Great mysteries keep you guessing, like this one.  Very instructive on the topic, which should be withheld for the viewer to find out by watching the movie.",1
757,Great acting. A bit too long.,1

762,"Ethereal and haunting take on the psychological aspect of undercover detective work, which is the main focus here rather than the crime itself.",1
763,"I chose to watch based on the two leads- Sean Harris and Joel Edgerton- who are both fantastic actors. I had no idea what the film was about. 25 minutes in I was saying ""Holy Sh**."" This is a slowly paced, layered, taut and atmospheric crime thriller based on a true story. Sean Harris lights up the screen. The movie builds a terrifying intensity. Believe the high reviews. The low reviews are from people who either weren't able to follow the film, aren't a fan of this style of film, or perhaps don't know the actors, particularly Sean Harris. If you like the leads you will drink it up. Admittedly it has a mysterious unlayering of the plot, but if you pay close attention it is very rewarding. I also found the conclusion satisfying, which literally culminates in the very last shot.",1
764,"This goes against the family's wishes. A very cruel and cash-grabbing feat. this was a particularly horrific and sad case, over very a long period of time with no closure prior. It's not entertainment. Family consent is important.",0

767,Far too long. The lunch scene with the other conductor was excruciating. Too much symphony jargon that no one but people involved in the symphony world would understand. Decent story but editors did not do their job and tighten it up.,0
768,Cate Blanchett. That’s it. That’s the review.,1
769,"Plot was fascinating.  Thought the movie was interesting.  There were a number of dynamics such as a broken family, transactional relationships, sex, power, failure, creativity at the highest level, are just a few.  Tar loved her daughter and that was clear.  Power hungry celebrity misused her status.  Tar pushed away everyone that was loyal to her.  Tar's musical acumen was showcased.  
Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job.   Her portrayal of the character was believable.",1
770,"Sound was inconstant, editing was needing help, the story line required supplementary information and it was largely boring.",0
771,Tar is an excellent movie that asks more questions than it answers. Cate Blanchett is superb.,1
772,"Definitely, this was one of the most interesting and well acted films I have ever viewed. Although I admit to being confused at times, as to why certain things were happening, i.e., audience members wearing masks, the more I think about the film, the more I appreciate it. CB beyond excellent.",1
773,"Cate Blanchet is again incredible. She is a conductor. That said, the ending left me a little puzzled. The crescendo and then,... nothing. I loved it anyway.",1
774,Cate Blanchett gave an amazing performance. The movie was beautiful to look at but it dragged on and on and on.,0
775,"The prose. Lyrical precise words, beautifully haunting, inviting somber elation. A Cinematic Masterpiece! Crisp poignant heart stopping shots! superb acting! Deserving of numerous Oscar nods. Ben Whishaw a shoe in for an Oscar with his brilliant tenderly thunderous performance as August!",1

795,"It showcases underlying problems of society we often overlook, not just about abortion and abandonement of children but also prostitution. Broker gives us a glimpse of what real life looks like through the each character's daily dilemma.",1
796,"The critically lauded and highly anticipated new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda is an exploration of self-worth and family bonds told through an unusual, eclectic group living on the edge of the law in modern society - an awful lot like Kore-eda's Palme d'Or-winning drama Shoplifters (except as a road movie), which was released only four years earlier. Questions of ethics and morality come to the forefront as characters confront their own desires and struggles to fulfill basic human connections, but overall Broker seems to be weighed down by a bit more sentimentality and predictability than you'd expect from a filmmaker of Kore-eda's reputation, trading on unconventional family dynamics that have been touched on in other works with more sincerity without interjecting a murder subplot (which everyone in the film seems weirdly okay with). 

The film is still very sweet without swinging over into saccharine, but can't help but feel like a slightly melodramatic reskin of narratives and character arcs we've seen executed with just as much impact before. (3.5/5)",1
797,It takes us to the journey of undeniable emotional rally. All the characters have poured their heart and soul into this film and especially Lee Ji Eun (IU)as So Young shows that mothers have love for their children no matter what and has portrayed the character best and without doubt best performance and A Must Watch Film!!!,1
798,A movie about a troubled and dysfunctional family struggling to redeem from its past sins. Only recommended to patient viewers. The last 15 minutes are truly disturbing!,0

It a depressing and cynical story about three siblings struggling through adult life after a childhood of trauma and abuse. Its especially difficult because this is the kind of horror that really happens to people.",1
806,An eerie and disturbing oldschool ghost story stlye horror with amazing acting from all but especially Robert Patrick and Nick Stahl.

809,"This film is slow to build, plot wise but I'd say the last part/section (just over an hour in) is most haunting. It's a tale about desperation, perseverence and greed. I feel its meant to be about redemption but I'm not sure that's ultimately the case. Can a man change his character later in life? perhaps or perhaps not. If you like arty, folklore type films then this may be worth a watch, otherwise not so much. I'm not certain I fully 'got' this film but I did like the ocassional landscape shot.",0
810,"Alessio Rigo de Righi and Matteo Zoppis' The Tale of King Crab opens with a moment that I found completely inviting.  We're in Tuscia in the company of a group of grizzled Italian fisherman, their faces weathered as much by the storms of life as by the elements of mother nature.  They are here to drink, have a bite to eat and to swap stories – not personal stories, mind you, but mythological tales.  We don't do this anymore.  People in groups these days are too bound up in discussing politics and personal inconveniences.  Spinning tales as old as time seems to have gone out of fashion.

The tale being told is quite wonderful.  It takes place not too far from Tuscia in a small village of Vejano near the opening of the 20th Century.  The central figure is Luciano (Gabriele Silli, who bears an odd resemblance to Michael Shannon), a sweaty, bearded drunk who returns after many years to this small town where his father is the local doctor.  He doesn't make any friends, let's just say, upon his return.  First, and without a reasonable explanation, he smashes open the front gate of the local prince (Enzo Cucchi).  Then he falls in love with the daughter of a respected farmer (Severino Sperandio) whose anger over the presence of this man is bad enough, but his fury over his apparent affections for his child are crossing the line.  Then we find out that there is a competitor – the prince himself has designs on marrying Emma not really for love, we suspect, but for the opportunities afforded by the union.  Much is too much and Luciano makes a decision that land him in exile on the god-forsaken island Patagonia.

Luciano's tale at this point kind of takes a left-turn.  After being exiled to the island where he takes on the identity of a now-dead priest whose company he shared.  The priest told him of a treasure that was left on the island by pirates and the only way to get it is to follow the footsteps of the king crab.  He goes in search of the king crab, carrying the bulky crustacean in a bucket.  Then he runs across a group of thieves looking to pilfer the legendary treasure for themselves.  They want it for greed, Luciano wants it because it might be a way off this stinking island.

I like where this movie has its head.  It is slow-going, but it is one of those movies in which you are completely and totally engrossed at every single moment.  It reminded me somewhat of Cast Away wherein we are asked to simply observe.  There isn't a ton of dialogue so we are asked to watch and see.  It feels like a story being told and you can imagine many different variations as the story is eroded and hones and sculpted by years of telling and telling and re-telling.  It is that movie with a quality of holding you in its spell and telling a story that you know you'll hear differently the next time.",1
811,"This is a quirky, insightful biopic about the life of an intriguing person - writer and artist/cartoonist Tove Jansson. I was a fan of the Moomins as a kid - I remember watching the cartoon show on CBBC and so this film appealed to me, as I knew little about the creator. I could certainly understand her wanting a form of escapism from the war, as the characters were invented during WWII it'd seem. The LGBT aspect was also interesting. I thought the main character was portrayed well by Alma Poysti. This is a good film I'd recommend, yes.",1

821,Story of a son avenging his family with a twist.,1
822,"I expected to be bored, but it was entertaining. Some odd parts, different than your typical Vikings movie.",1
823,"A dark, eerie tragedy that entertwines the religious iconography of Norse legend with unfettered brutality of Viking living. Stunning visuals, suspense, and a heartbreaking tragic hero",1
824,Excellent story line! Captivated me the entire movie and the cast was perfect for this movie. It definitely didnt disappoint!,1
825,"Clever, contemporary comedy.  Excellent script, solid acting.  Highly recommend.",1
826,"Not usually a horror film person, but it was intriguing and kept my attention all the way through.  Funny moments and shocking moments.  I thought the acting was really good. Just wished there was a little more character development.",1
827,Pretty disturbing and predictable. Had to leave halfway through.,0
828,"Absolutely loved this movie. Some laugh out loud funny moments, great tension and suspense, and fantastic performances by the actors.",1
829,Too creepy for me. Definitely more horror. No comedy in my opinion.,0
830,"I’m usually not into gore movies but I thoroughly enjoyed this. It was layered with suspense, humor, and symbolism while offering social commentary and unexpected twists.",1
831,"dark and twisted yet still very entertaining, gripping, and unexpected. A solid definition of a thriller.",1
832,Ralph Fiennes was perfectly cast as the crazy chef.  the plot unfolds throughout the movie.  highly recommend this movie.,1
833,"This movie is very weird! But in a good way! I’m not real sure what I just saw, but I loved it and was very amused and horrified by it! What can I say?! I’ll never look at cheeseburgers or s’mores the same way again!",1
834,"After Yang is a beautifully written, well paced, emotional, and grounded Sci-Fi story. 2022 is the year of Colin Farrell. He is so good in this. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well and it really elevates the story. The dialogue is very natural as well. It was really cool seeing a grounded take on a robot story. It was very interesting to watch and it was well executed. I'd say maybe the only few flaws I have with this movie are that it's very slow but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just depends on the viewer. Overall, this a really good movie and a very unique story.

Pros:
- Colin Ferrell 
- Premise
- Writing 
- Dialogue 
- Story

Cons:
- Slow",1
835,All I remember that it was interesting but honestly I can't remember what it was about.,1
836,"Wow, was not expecting to like this as much as i did. I felt it was going to be another beautiful pretentious art film, with a story that goes nowhere. But it was an emotional and thoughtful story of loss and life, done in a very smart way.
However, you really have to be in the right mood for this film, but very much worth the watch.",1
837,A beautiful and thought provoking film. The blending of Asian and American cultures in a truly blended/cross cultural family should be embraced by all.,1
838,"Being a Colin Farrell completist means sitting through some films that bend the mind.  This was a challenging watch in which I just couldn't connect with the subject material of a robot full of questions and mystery.  Well-acted and engaging and interesting at first, the movie then became annoying and redundant.  A film about if artificial intelligence has feelings and how humans connect, but the viewer may have a harder time falling in love with a robot.  A Sci-Fi flick that just wasn't my cup of tea! Final Score: 4.3/10",0
839,"Just watched the movie and was impressed by the direction, acting, and story telling. I appreciate the attempt to make the movie feel futuristic with interesting fashion/aesthetics. If you don’t mind a slow burn — this is a movie with a payout in the end. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this on a chill weekend movie night. Sci fi fans should give it a shot and you’ll see the theme of humanity questioned in a new and original way (similar to blade runner). This movie left me reflecting on my own life and gave appreciation for experiences. Oddly, this is a feel good movie!",1
840,"After Yang is a beautiful film. One that questions, what truly defines a life? Often us, as humans, take so much for granted that, at times, seem to take lives as a material object. One that we can just throw away once we are done as if it never mattered to us at all. Do we ever appreciate what is right in front of us? Or is it that cliche, that we don’t truly miss something or know what we had until it’s gone forever?",1
841,"One of the most boring films I've watched in the last 20 years. Do something else with the 101 minutes, you'll never get them back.",0
842,"Pretentious, boring, waste of talent.",0
843,"After Yang is equal parts sci-fi and slow drama. Beautifully filmed, quiet and slow it follows the story of a little Chinese girl's techno-being (AI) that stops working. Ferrell goes on a hunt to find out his quasi-human history. And though the plot isn't incredibly satisfying, it's well acted and thoughtful.",1
844,Nanny was a long and pointless movie about repetitive and unnecessary scenes and characters.,0
845,"One of those films that makes you think 'Why did they bother?', nothing new or particularly interesting, some ok acting, just very meh.",0
846,It's a very bad movie,0
847,bittersweetly perfect in every way!,1
848,"This movie should have been directed by someone else. Completely cheapened the story with the weird hues throughout the film and weirdly put together scenes, the transitions just weren't there and it felt more like a fetish film in the beginning than the incredible beautifully written story. So disappointed by the artistic direction of this film and wish it could be re-shot by someone else.",0
849,"There were quite a few problems with ""The Nanny"", which doesn't have anyone named Fran Drescher.  Namely, the subtitles, or lack there of.  If you want to understand the Wolof language parts you need to have subtitles on, but then you also get English subs.  There was no way to have one and not the other which is a movie experience destroyer.  An excruciating slog, there was nothing scary or tense and there was no reason to care.  This is not a horror film.  The ending is so neat and tidy you'd think you were watching a Rom-Com.  Final Score: 2.7/10",0
850,I kept waiting for it to get better so in that way it kept my attention but sadly and hour and 40 minutes wasted…,0
851,"C'est dommage que Aisha (pas Aïcha?!?!) et Mariatou n'ont pas l'accent de vrai sénégalais en parlant wolof; ça tue un peu l'image de l'immigré / mère-célibataire venant du Sénégal…de plus, le fils Lamine parle uniquement anglais avec accent américain! Mais bon, fen mouy defarou mbokk mo geun deugg gou koy yaaq. 🤷‍♀️",0
852,A rushed and poorly written ending made watching this a disappointing experience. Definitely not a horror movie and definitely not worth the time.,0
853,"""Nanny"" is a more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror. It's a slow character build of a film that is beautifully shot and extremely well acted. Unfortunately ""Nanny"" lacks the horror elements that it continually suggests and when it does deliver some horror in cgi form it is too obvious and looks completely fake and out of place.

The main focus is a Senegal immigrant , Aisha, who dreams that her new job will bring enough money to allow her son to join her in America. The "" horror"" is a fear or suggestion of drowning in water which is used to great artistic effect. However throughout the film there are a number of side characters that seem to suggest further potential horror elements such as witchcraft and sirens which never really materialise into much.  

""Nanny"" is a dream or reality type of thriller that delivers fear through threatening the American dream that Aisha is struggling to achieve. Sadly spoiled by the unnecessary cgi ""Nanny"" otherwise is a beautiful artistic character study with psychologically disturbing elements.",0
854,It's a very cute and light movie. I laughed at some moments and cried at others. A pleasant experience.,0
855,"This was everything that I hoped it would be, a triumph.  I was in such a good mood when it was over.  So that's what I call a good movie.",1
856,"Lena Dunham sadly has departed from many plot points in a much-beloved YA book. Anyone who has read this will be looking forward to the movie and will be disappointed with the MANY changes. 
The basic premise exists but the fate of many characters has been twisted. Her best friend's fate, her father's personality, her uncle's journey, Birdy's ultimate resolution to her impending wedding, the fate of the money she was given - these were changed and I don't see how this made it better than the book.
Boo to you, Lena Dunham.",0
857,"Unenjoyable and even painful to watch. I understand now that it's based on a book, but regardless I was genuinely shocked by how much I could not stand this movie, especially considering the excellent actors in it and the fact Lena Dunham directed and produced it. I'm just left feeling like I was happier not knowing this movie existed, which seems harsh but I can usually find something I appreciate in any movie or book (and unfortunately, I feel the need to finish either once I've started it... This movie took two sittings to finish 😶). I personally found nothing redeemable in the storyline, the cringe-worthy writing, or even the acting (despite loving a few of the actors from other things). It felt false and out of touch somehow.
I've also never left a review on a movie anywhere, ever, but this one compelled me to write something. It was awful. This is the first time I've genuinely hated a movie for every single moment, and considering all angles!",0
858,"A refreshing medieval, coming-of-age story.   I found it delightfully quirky and unique.",1
859,"Wonderful writing. It somehow, successfully, combines old and modern English as well as old and new cinematic themes. Its a clever coming of age story, thoroughly enjoyable for slightly nerdy introverts. If you like books like Jane Eyre, you'll love this film.",1
860,"Lena Dunham's film makes some odd choices, but it is funny enough to get adults and children alike to be engaged and satisfied.  Bella Ramsey stars and her charisma exudes off the screen.  If you're willing to let go the negative and have fun, you may just enjoy!  Final Score: 6.8/10",1
861,It was a bit odd but it held my interest. Some crudeness. A touching end. Played well. Nice to see Billie Piper. Music was enjoyable too.,1
862,"Thank you Lena Dunham for creating a film in the medieval times that is not raunchy. Many others would take advantage of doing so with the growing up theme in this story. However you did not, you treated the story with sensitivity and dignity as it should be portrayed for all.",1
863,"Original, very well acted and fun. I really enjoyed it",1
